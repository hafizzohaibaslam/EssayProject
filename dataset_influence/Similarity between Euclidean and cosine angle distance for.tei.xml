				<p>Understanding the relationship among different distance measures is helpful in choosing a proper one for a particular application. In this paper, we compare two commonly used distance measures in vector models, namely, Euclidean distance (EUD) and cosine angle distance (CAD), for nearest neighbor (NN) queries in high dimensional data spaces. Using theoretical analysis and experimental results, we show that the retrieval results based on EUD are similar to those based on CAD when dimension is high. We have applied CAD for content based image retrieval (CBIR). Retrieval results show that CAD works no worse than EUD, which is a commonly used distance measure for CBIR, while providing other advantages, such as naturally normalized distance.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>hand, it is also important to choose a similarity measure that is consistent with human ideas of similarity. The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> have proposed a similarity measure based on noise distribution of the image database. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, a mathematical analysis of EUD and CAD has been done. It was shown that CAD has a special property to favor relatively larger component in a vector.</p><p>In this paper, we compare two commonly used distance measures in vector models, namely, Euclidean distance (EUD) and cosine angle distance (CAD), for nearest neighbor (NN) queries in high dimensional data spaces. From theoretical analysis and experimental results, we find that the retrieval results based on EUD are similar to those based on CAD. We use a high dimensional geometrical model to analyze how similar these two distance measures are under the assumption of uniform data distribution. We find that the NN of EUD is also ranked high by CAD when dimension is high. We define NN as the first nearest neighbor of the query. Our experimental results have corroborated the correctness of our model. We have also compared these two distance measures experimentally using normalized datasets and clustered datasets. Our conclusions are that:</p><p>Distance measure is an important part of a vector model. Among all distance measures that are proposed in the literature, some have very similar behaviors in similarity queries, while others may behave quite differently. Understanding the relationship among distance measures can help us to choose a proper distance measure for a particular application.</p><p>One way of comparing distance measures is to study their retrieval performance in terms of precision and recall in a particular application area, such as content-based image retrieval (CBIR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and video copy detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. One concern in choosing a particular distance measure is the impact of computational overhead on system performance. When feature vectors are large, some distance measures may consume more computing resources than the others. One possible approximation of EUD is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. On the other 1. In high dimensional data spaces, the NN query results by EUD and CAD are very similar. 2. For clustered data, the NN query results by EUD and CAD are more similar. 3. When vectors are normalized by its size, the NN query results by EUD and CAD are also more similar.</p><p>One application of the above properties is to combine features that are semantically different (e.g. color and texture) in CBIR as explained below. As EUD is often used as a distance measure for individual features in CBIR, inter-feature normalization is needed to combine EUD values of different scales into an over-all score for an image. Based on the property that NN query results of EUD and CAD are very similar in high dimensional spaces, we propose to use CAD instead of EUD for individual features. As CAD values are naturally normalized by norm, there is no need for further inter-feature normalization. Thus, the distance value from different features can be summed up directly as the final score for an image in the database. Our experimental results show that our proposal works not only no worse than other commonly used methods but also has some favorable advantages.</p><p>There are a number of methods proposed for combining features in CBIR. They can be divided into two categories: rank based <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> and distance value based <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Rank based methods are also called "voting methods" in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In rank based methods, the rank of an image for different features are calculated first, then these ranks are summed to derive the final rank of the image. Distance value based methods use distance value of individual features directly.</p><p>Since distance values from different features have different scales, inter-feature normalization is necessary for computing the final rank of an image. One simple method in this category is to divide all distance values of a feature by the maximum distance value <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Another widely used method for combining features are based on the assumption that distance values have a Gaussian distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Some discussion and comparisons of methods for combining features can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</p><p>Using CAD as a normalized distance measure was mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, but no analysis or experimental results were presented in the context of vector models or CBIR. We have done experiments to compare the CAD based method we proposed with two widely used methods, namely, rank based method by EUD and distance value based method with Gaussian assumption.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical analysis of NN queries by EUD and CAD using a geometrical model in high dimensions. Section 3 and 4 present experimental results for comparing EUD and CAD and combining multiple features, respectively. Section 5 discusses the conclusion and future work.</p><p>3.

Note that the purpose of this experiment is not to capture all possible semantics of the query image (e.g. tigers), but to show the effectiveness of the CAD-based method. The size of the answer set (relevant set) of each query image ranges from 4 to 40. We use recall and precision to measure the performance of each combining method. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> show the average recalls and precisions of 10, 20, 50 and 100 NN query results.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Discussion</head><p>The vector model is used for an approximate generalization of the real world objects. The definition of "similar" is subjective and depend on the way feature vectors are generated. Based on the above theoretical analysis and experimental results, we consider EUD and CAD very similar when applied to NN queries in high dimensional data spaces. We explain this phenomena based on the norm of the vectors. When all vectors have the same norm, the NN query results by EUD and CAD will be exactly the same. Based on the assumption of uniform distribution, as dimension gets higher, the variance of the norms of the vectors in the dataset becomes smaller. As the norms become similar, EUD and CAD also become similar. For clustered data and normalized data in high dimensional spaces, the norms of the vectors are even more similar which causes EUD and CAD to behave more similarly. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS FOR COM-BINING FEATURES</head><p>is the rank based method using ranks of individual features by EUD. "Gaussian" is the distance value based method using Gaussian assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. For "Gaussian", EUD values computed for individual features are normalized using the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">d = d ? m 6¦Ò + 1 2<label>(9)</label></formula><p>We have shown that when dimension is high, which is usually the case for a CBIR application, EUD and CAD are similar. EUD is widely used in CBIR. However, CAD has the unique property that the distance value is inherently normalized for a given feature. This makes combining semantically different features as easy as summing up the CAD values from different features. As an application for our analysis, we propose to use CAD measure instead of EUD for CBIR where multiple features are combined to create a single distance value. Experimental results for this analysis are presented in this section.</p><p>We use an image database of 6344 color images of animals and natural scenes. Two image features, color and texture, are used for image retrieval. The color feature is a 64-dimensional vector generated by QBIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The texture feature is a 24-dimensional vector generated using the algorithms proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. 18 images of animals are chosen from the database as the query images due to their clear semantic meaning. The answer set of each query image is</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In Equation 9, d and d</head><p>are the original and normalized distance value, respectively. m and ¦Ò are the mean and standard deviation of pair-wise distances over all images in the database. Any value greater than 1 is considered as 1 in the experiments as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. "Angle" is the distance value based method we proposed, which uses CAD directly for inter-feature normalization.</p><p>Based on precision and recall, the performance of combining methods are similar, though "Rank Euclidean" is a little behind. As mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, rank-based method may not be very effective since it does not directly use the distance value between the query and the retrieved image. The rank of retrieved images may give a false sense of similarity when actually the distance value may be very large. On the other hand, distance value based method using Gaussian assumption may not be effective if the distance distribution pattern among images in the database is not Gaussian. Another problem of this scheme is that it requires the mean and Angle Rank Euclidean If the database is large and changes dynamically, the cost to maintain such value may be expensive. Thus we believe our simple CAD value based method for combining features is better compared to the two methods mentioned above. Moreover, it will not affect the results much to replace EUD by CAD as we have shown in the previous sections. Besides the benefit of simplicity, the CAD based method also has another special property, i.e., the CAD favors (retrieves) vectors with relatively larger component values <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. This effect is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>, which shows the results of a 20 NN query. The first image at the upper-left corner is the query image. Since the query image has dominant color components blue and brown, nearly all 20 images returned by the CAD based method ("Angle") has blue and brown as their dominant color components. On the other hand, the rank based method by EUD ("Rank Euclidean") only returns about 10 such images out of 20 images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSION</head><p>Through our theoretical analysis and experimental results, we conclude that EUD and CAD are similar when applied to high dimensional NN queries.
