			<abstract>
				<p>Under the different searches performed to analyzing social networks, much attention has been devoted to the problem of predicting links. It is a key technique in many applications such as recommendation systems which provide suggestions of potential links between nodes. Traditional link prediction methods use a single proximity metric. In this paper, we study link prediction as a supervised learning task where we try to combine multiple features as input data for classification. To improve the accuracy of prediction, we have been applying a select attributes algorithm. Experiments have been performed on two co-authorship data sets. Results demonstrate that Random Forest, k-nearest neighbors and Principal Component Analysis yield the best performances. a small diameter, which is also known as the small-world phenomenon or the six degrees of separation[4]. The density: of a graph measuring the extent to which it is a complete graph. The real networks often have a density very weak. We often observe that the number of links is proportional to the number of nodes. The Distribution degrees: of a node is known by the number of its direct neighbors. In real networks is often observed that there is some nodes that have very high degrees, and many others have very low degrees. Distribution of degrees is often described by a distribution power law [5].</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. RELATED WORK</head><p>This article presents a link predictor based on classification and selected attributes algorithms. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in the following section, we present a literature review. Section 3 describes the proposed method. Then we demonstrate the experiments and achieved results. The last part contains conclusions and future work.</p><p>Given a graphical view of the social network at a specific time, the prediction of link can be considered as a task of discovering new link may recur in future time or predict unknown link, previously hidden. Generally, the methods proposed in the literature can be classified into three categories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Similarity based Methods:</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. BASIC PROPERTIES OF SOCIAL NETWORKS</head><p>Generally, a social network is modeled by a graph G = (V, E) where V presents the set of nodes and E is the edges between entities. In several studies concerning complex networks, a set of common properties has been observed in order to characterize the behavior of the network. In the following part, definitions of some features are provided which are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>The principle embodied in these methods is to compute a score for each connection pair (x, y) in the graph. Therefore ties possessing the best results are chosen as links provided. In general, the scoring functions used are generated from neighborhood, paths or groups of nodes:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Neighborhood based features [8]:</head><p>? Common neighbors (CN) which presents the number of interactions that two users have in common.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">CN (u, v) = |¦£(u) ¡É ¦£(v)|</formula><p>The diameter: is the longest of the shortest paths between all possible pairs of nodes through their connections. Different studies have shown that large network of interactions having</p><p>? Preferential attachment (PA) feature which indicates that new connections are more liable to be formed between the nodes having a higher degree than nodes </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Diameter D = maxij dij Local clustering coefficient Ci = 2m i n i (n i ?1)</formula><p>mi nb of edges connected to node i ni nb of neighbors of node i Global clustering coefficient Cg = 1 n i Ci with a low degree.</p><p>them. The shorter distance between nodes, the higher chance of link formation between them.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P A(u, v) = |¦£(u)| * |¦£(v)|</formula><p>? Jaccard coefficient (JC) is a normalized measure of common neighbors. It is calculated as the common neighbors divided by the total combined neighbors nodes.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">JC(u, v) = |¦£(u)¡É¦£(v)| |¦£(u)¡É¦£(v)|</formula><p>? Adamic Adar (AA) this function assigns weights to common neighbors. The least shared common neighbors having the highest weight.</p><p>3) Clustering based features: Some researchers have used clustering for improving the task of predicting link <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[12]</ref>. In their work, the community information reveals the existence of a high density of ties within groups of nodes, while there is a low level of links between these groups. Such procedures include an improved quality of link prediction algorithms. They apply firstly a partitioning scheme ( sub-graph mining approaches, Hierarchical structure, spectral clustering ...) to divide the network into communities. Then they use the obtained clustering structure information for the link prediction. There are different cluster based information such as intra-cluster or within-cluster (WC) and inter-cluster (IC).</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">AA(u, v) = z¡Ê¦£(u)¡É¦£(v) 1 log(|¦£(z)|)</formula><p>? Resource Allocation (RA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> this similarity between both nodes u and u can be defined as the amount of resource that v received from u. Resources will be sent through the common neighbors. Generally, each neighbor has only one resource unit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Maximum Likelihood Methods</head><formula xml:id="formula_5">RA(u, v) = z¡Ê¦£(u)¡É¦£(v) 1 |¦£(z)|</formula><p>These methods are interested to determine the probability that a link will be formed in the next period of time. To do this from the graph, a model will be constructed by maximizing the likelihood of the observed structure. Then, the probability of an unconnected link can be calculated according the built model. Generally, there are two approaches to the maximum likelihood which the most known are:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Path based features [10]:</head><p>? Katz sums all paths and gives to the shortest paths more weight.</p><p>? Hierarchical Structure Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[13]</ref> that is based on the hierarchical structure of the graph. It takes into consideration the ancestors of the nodes for predicting the probability of link.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Katz(xy) = ¡Þ l=1 ¦Â l paths(uv) &lt;l&gt;</formula><p>where paths(uv) &lt;l&gt; is the entire paths between u and v, with length l.</p><p>? Stochastic Block Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[14]</ref>: Block Model where nodes are partitioned into groups, and the likelihood that two nodes are linked depends only on the communities to which they belong.</p><p>? PageRank presents the probability that a node will be achieved by a random walk over the graph.</p><p>C. Probabilistic models</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P (u) = (1 ? d) + d z¡Ê¦£(u) P (z) |¦£(z)|</formula><p>where d is depreciation factor indicates the likelihood of visiting neighboring nodes instead of restarting the original node u.</p><p>? Random Walk Restart (RWR) which consider a random walker starting from the node, who will iteratively move to a random neighbor with a given probability.</p><p>These methods make the abstraction of the underlying structure of the network, based on observed data in a compact probabilistic model. The learned model consists of a group of parameters which may better adjust to the observed data. Then, unobserved links can be predicted via the probability estimated conditionally to these parameters. There are three probabilistic models which are:</p><p>? Shortest Path Distance (SPD) between two nodes is defined as the minimum number of edges connecting</p><p>? probabilistic relational models <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[15]</ref>: PMR is a probability distribution over the set of attributes of a relational database. The properties of an object depend on other properties of the same object and those of related objects. ? Stochastic relational models <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[16]</ref>: SRM consists in modeling the stochastic structure of links by a tensor interaction of multiple Gaussian process (GP), each defined on a type of entities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Feature extraction</head><p>This section outlines all features that have been extracted and used throughout the experiments. We considered a variety of features such as:</p><p>? Probabilistic Entity Relationship Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[17]</ref>: PERM makes relationships the first class objects in the modeling language, and promotes an explicit representation of conditional probabilistic distribution.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">1) Node degree (N D): Let's u ¡Ê V is an author, u'degree (|¦£(u)|)</formula><p>is defined as the number authors who collaborated with them .</p></div>

PROPOSED METHOD</head><p>2) NB of Publication (N P ): Presents the number of papers written by each author.</p><p>Considering a G = (V ; E) the graph that represents the structure of a social network. The goal of our work was to construct a link a predictor by using machine learning techniques which for every two nodes x, y ¡Ê V can predict if the connection between two nodes has a high probability of the existence or not. The proposed method, summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 1</ref>, contains the following steps:</p><p>3) Common neighbors (cm): This is the number of researchers, with which the two researchers have had some collaboration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Connected neighbors (CN N ):</head><p>For two authors u, v ¡Ê V , the number of connected neighbors is the number of existing links between the set of neighbors of each author IE ((x, y) ¡Ê E where x ¡Ê ¦£(u) and y ¡Ê ¦£(v)).</p><p>?

Data Description 7) Adamic/Adar (AA): Two researchers have common neighbor less shared with others are more alike than two nodes have common neighbors which common for many other nodes.</p><p>Experiments and evaluations have been performed on two co authorship networks from two different areas of physics: Astro-physics (Astro ph) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> and High energy physics theory (Hep th) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> . It has been extracted from Arxive-print archive. In these data, we only include authors who have published articles between 1994 and 1996, for the training data and from 1997 to 1999 for the test sets. Within these networks, the authors correspond to the nodes and link exists between two authors if they worked together.</p><p>8) Preferential Attachment (P A): In a collaboration network, this means a new cooperation is more likely to occur between authors having a great collaboration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Link predictor</head><p>Generally, there are two types of predictors link: simple link predictor which uses a single feature measure, and composite link predictor, which is based on multiple proximity measures. ? Simple link predictor which consists of a single proximity measure. Given an input graph which models a past snapshot of a given social network, a node pair is predicted to form an edge in the future if and only if the proximity between x and y is sufficiently large. ? Composite link predictors which use machine learning techniques to make link predictions based on multiple attribute measures.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extracting features</head><p>Label class Label class <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Preparation of training data sets and test data</p><p>We have applied the WEKA machine learning package to generate link predictors using several machine learning algorithms. We investigated a variety of the most known supervised methods, such as decision trees (J48), k-nearestneighbors (KNN), naive Bayes, Radial basis function network (RBF Network) and Random Forest.</p><p>especially the best performances have been completed by both algorithms KNN and Random Forest.</p><p>Firstly, we examine these algorithms with only a single attribute. Then, we used the complete combination attributed to understand the benefits of the combination of several measures.</p><p>After such experiments we attempted to enhance the results obtained. We thought looked the best representation of used proximity attributes to achieve the maximum of true predicted links. For this, we have applied an attribute selection algorithm, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in conjunction with a ranker search method. PCA is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linear uncorrelated variables called principal components.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS</head><p>We have formed a classification data set as follows (see <ref type="figure">figure 2</ref>): we took all the links that are established in 1996 and 1999 (for training and test set respectively). Each of these pairs, denote a positive example. Concerning non existent links, we randomly selected certain edges (seen the large number) and labeled them as negative instances.</p><p>Finally, the last two tables showing the improvements obtained while using PCA with the learning techniques KNN and Random Forest. Indeed it can be seen that the accuracy is increased from 0.625 to 0.94 with the astro ph database and from 0.866 to 0.979 with the hep th data set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>Then we constructed the feature vector for each pair of authors. Characteristics of these instances are constructed from the first two years of each data <ref type="bibr">(1994)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(1997)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1998)</ref>. In the following, we report the experimental results of our proposed method.</p><p>We employ precision and recall, measurements for evaluating of the proposed algorithm. The achieved results are shown in the following tables listed below. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables III,IV showing</ref> precisions and recalls of different learning techniques on the basis of only one attribute (e.g CN, AA, PA). For the database Hep th the best results were found by applying the algorithm (KNN and Random Forest) with the attribute (AA and PA respectively). While for the database Astro ph, the top values was found by the method J48 and AA measure proximity.</p><p>Social networks have achieved a high success over the years and have become a very important way for communication between people. They have been attracted the interest of several analysis researches. This paper investigates the link prediction problem in two collaboration networks. Our method relies on a set of attributes, retrieved from the various snapshots of the network. various learning algorithms have been applied to these features. Best results were found using KNN and Random Forest algorithms. A selection attributes method , based on PCA, enhances the prediction rate. As future work we consider using other types of attributes (semantic, temporal, ...) and investigate our method for a recommendation application.</p></div>
