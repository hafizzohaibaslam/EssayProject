<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MODELS OF SOCIAL CORRELATION</head><p>We study a setting where a group of individuals (also called agents or users) are nodes of a social network G. In general, G is a directed graph and is generated from an unknown probability distribution. We are concerned with individuals performing a certain action for the first time, e.g., purchasing a product, visiting a web-page, or tagging a photo with a particular tag.</p><p>1 After an agent performs the action, we say that the agent has become active. We observe Confounding. The second explanation for correlation between actions of adjacent agents in a social network is external influence from elements in the environment (also referred to as confounding factors), which are more likely to affect individuals that are located close to each other in the social network. Mathematically, this means that there is a confounding variable X, and both the network G and the set of active individuals W come from distributions correlated with X. For example, two individuals who live in the same city are more likely to become friends than two random individuals, and they are also more likely to take pictures of similar scenery and post them on Flickr with the same tag.</p><p>Note that there is a fine distinction between this explanation and homophily: homophily refers to situations where the set W affects individuals' choices to become friends, while in confounding, both the choices of individuals to become friends and their choice to become active are affected by the same unobserved variable. It is possible to distinguish between these models by looking at the time where the edges of G are established. The focus of this paper, however, is on distinguishing social influence from other types of social correlation. Therefore, we study a common generalization of the confounding and the homophily model as follows: first, the pair (G, W ) is selected according to a joint probability distribution, and then the time of activation for individuals in W is picked i.i.d. according to a distribution T on <ref type="bibr">[0, T ]</ref>. We call this model the correlation model. The main assumption here is that the probability that an individual is active can be affected by whether their friends become active, but not by when they become active. This is in contrast with the influence model, as defined below.</p><p>1 In many cases, e.g., purchasing certain products or using certain tags, an individual might perform the action multiple times. We focus on the first time the action is performed by each individual, since subsequent occurrences of the same action by the same individual is often more dependent on the first occurrence than on the social network.</p><p>Influence. The third, and perhaps the most consequential explanation for social correlation is social influence. This refers to the phenomenon that the action of individuals can induce their friends to act in a similar way. This can be through setting an example for their friends (as in the case of fashion), informing them about the action (as in the case of viral marketing), or increasing the value of an action for them (as in the case of adoption of a technology). Mathematically, this can be modeled as follows: first, the graph G is drawn according to some distribution. Then, in each of the time steps 1, . . . , T , each non-active agent decides whether to become active. The probability of becoming active for each agent u is a function p(x) of the number x of other agents v that have an edge to u and are already active.</p><p>where ¦Á and ¦Â are coefficients. Equivalently,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">2 ln = ¦Á ln(a + 1) + ¦Â.<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Here, p(¡¤) can be any increasing function, although later in the paper we consider a special class of functions that provides a good fit with the real data and also corresponds to a commonly used statistical model for estimating the probability of binary events, namely the logistic regression.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p(a) 1 ? p(a)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">METHODOLOGY</head><p>In this section we present the methodology that we use to measure social correlation and test whether influence is a source of such correlation. We start in Section 3.1 by explaining how logistic regression can be used to quantify the extent of social correlation. In Section 3.2 we define the shuffle test for deciding if influence is a likely source of correlation, and prove that this test successfully rules out influence as the source of correlation in the correlation (confounding/homophily) model defined in Section 2. Finally, in Section 3.3 we define another test called the edge-reversal test, which we evaluate experimentally.</p><p>The coefficient ¦Á measures social correlation: a large value of ¦Á indicates a large degree of correlation. We estimate ¦Á, ¦Â using maximum likelihood logistic regression. More precisely, let Ya,t be the number of users who at the beginning of time t had a active friends and started using the tag at time t. Similarly, let Na,t be those users who at time t were inactive, had a active friends, but did not start using the tag (at time t). Finally, let Ya = t Ya,t, and Na = t Na,t. Then we compute the values of ¦Á and ¦Â that maximize the expression</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p(a) Ya (1 ? p(a)) Na ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>a</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Measuring social correlation</head><p>The first step in our analysis is to obtain a measure of social correlation between the actions of an individual and that of her friends in the network. This measure is designed to recover the activation probability, assuming that the agents follow the influence model defined in Section 2.</p><p>Recall that in the influence model, each individual flips an independent coin in every time step to decide whether or not to become active. In principle, the probability of this coin can vary from agent to agent and from time to time; in the simplest model, which is the focus of most of this paper, we measure this probability as a function of only one variable: the number of already-active friends the agent has.</p><p>3 Note that the parameter we use is the number of friends that have become active at any earlier time step, as opposed to friends who have become active immediately before. This is because in online systems like Flickr actions are stored, and might be observed by others much later.</p><p>As it turns out, for most tags in the Flickr data set, a logistic function with the logarithm of the number of friends as the explanatory variable provides a good fit for the probability. Therefore, for simplicity and to reduce the possibility of overfitting, we use the logistic function with this variable, that is, we estimate the probability p(a) of activation for an agent with a already-active friends as follows:</p><p>where p(a) is defined in (1). Typically, the values of Ya and Na decrease quickly and lose their statistical significance as a grows. Therefore, for practical reasons, we may restrict the likelihood expression (3) to only all a ¡Ü R, for a carefully chosen value of R, while we accumulate all the values corresponding to a &gt; R to YR+1 and NR+1. While in general there is no closed form solution, there are many software packages that can solve such a problem quite efficiently; we used Matlab's statistics toolbox in our experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The shuffle test</head><p>In this section we introduce the shuffle test for identifying social influence. It is based on the idea that if influence does not play a role, even though an agent's probability of activation could depend on her friends, the timing of such activation should be independent of the timing of other agents.</p><p>Let G be the social network, and W = {w1, . . . , w } be the set of users that are activated during the period <ref type="bibr">[0, T ]</ref>. Recall that in the correlation model, (G, W ) is drawn from an arbitrary joint distribution. Assume that user wi is first activated at time ti. Using the method in Section 3.1, we compute Ya and Na, for a ¡Ü R, where R is a constant, and use the maximum likelihood method to estimate ¦Á.</p><p>Next, we create a second problem instance with the same graph G and the same set W of active nodes, by picking a random permutation ¦Ð of {1, . . . , and setting the time of activation of node wi to t i := t ¦Ð(i) . Again we use the method in Section 3.1 to compute Y a and N 4 ¦Á ln(a+1)+¦Â</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p(a) = e 1 + e ¦Á ln(a+1)+¦Â ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>2 This model assumes that time progresses in discrete steps. A similar model with continuous time can be defined using the Poisson distribution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> We also considered using the fraction of the total population that is active as another explanatory variable in our estimation on the Flickr data set, but the results indicated that this parameter is of no value: the corresponding coefficient is insignificant for almost all tags. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> We have also duplicated some of our experiments using a as the explanatory variable. The results are not qualitatively different, and almost always the likelihood of the fit is better with the logarithmic variable.</p><p>a for a ¡Ü R, and the social correlation coefficient ¦Á . The shuffle test declares that the model exhibits no social influence if the values of ¦Á and ¦Á are close to each other. Intuitively, the reason that the shuffle test correctly rules out social influence in instances generated according to the correlation model is the following: in an instance generated from this model, the time stamps ti are independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) from a distribution T over <ref type="bibr">[0, T ]</ref>. The second instance constructed above only permutes all time stamps, and hence the new t i 's are still i.i.d. from the same distribution T . Therefore, the two instances come from the exact same distribution, and hence they should lead to the same expected social correlation coefficient ¦Á. The only thing that remains to be proven is that this coefficient is concentrated around its expectation (where the expectation is taken over the random choice of the time stamps, conditioning on a fixed choice of G and W ). In the next section, we formalize this intuition, leading to Theorem 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Theoretical analysis</head><p>To aid our analysis, we make three simplifying assumptions. First, we assume that the distribution T of the activation times is uniform over <ref type="bibr">[0, T ]</ref>. Second, we modify the test to pick each t tag. Finally, if a = R + 1 (recall that R + 1 corresponds to the ensemble of all the values greater than R), then the probability is (d</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">W ? i ? R)/(d W ? i + 1).</formula><p>Thus, we have i independently from T , instead of using a permutation of the original time stamps. Neither of these assumptions is necessary, but it simplifies the arguments without substantively changing the techniques.</p><p>The third set of assumptions ensures that there are enough data to gather statistics. Let d</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">E[Ya] = E[Y i a ] = + 1 , i=1 i:d W ? i ¡Ýa 1 d W ? i ?</formula><note type="other">for a ¡Ü R, and + i (d i ) be the indegree (outdegree) of node wi, and let d W ? i (d W + i</note><p>) be the indegree (outdegree) of node wi in the subgraph induced by W (recall that W is the set of users that became active). Also, let W = {w1, . . . , w }, where ¡Ý be the set of nodes in W and their neighbors (note that the first nodes are those in W ). Then we make the following assumptions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">E[Ya] = E[Y i d ? R a ] = W ? i + 1 , i=1 i:d W ? i ¡ÝR+1 d W ? i 1. = ¦¨(n).</formula><p>for a = R + 1. One can verify that from our assumptions we have that both of these quantities are ¦¨(n). Note that the terms are not independent. Thus, to show concentration, we will employ Azuma's inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. For a fixed a we define the (Doob's) martingale</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">2. d ? + i , d i ¡Ü d max , for i ¡Ü and for some constant d max . Xi = E[Ya | t1, t2, . . . , ti]. 3. {i : d W ? i ¡Ý R + 1} = ¦¨(n).</formula><p>These assumptions are not the strictest possible for our results to hold, but they are nevertheless quite natural and simple to state. In particular, we make the first assumption only to simplify the notation (otherwise the results hold with probabilities that depend on and instead of n).</p><p>We have that X0 = E <ref type="bibr">[Ya]</ref> and X = Ya. Note that we have that |Xi ? Xi?1| ¡Ü d</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">W + i</formula><p>+ 1, since a node affects only itself the nodes for which it is a contact. Then Azuma's inequality implies that</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">? Pr(|Ya ? E[Ya]| &gt; ¦Ë) = Pr(|X ? X 0 | &gt; ¦Ë) ¡Ü 2e ¦Ë 2 2 (d W + i +1) 2 ,</formula><p>Theorem 1. Let G = (V, E) be a directed graph on n nodes and let W = {w1, . . . , w } ? V be the set of nodes that become active during the time period <ref type="bibr">[0, T ]</ref>. Assume that the activation time ti of the node wi is picked i.i.d. from the uniform distribution over {1, . . . , T }, and assume that the three assumptions hold. Let ¦Á denote the social correlation coefficient computed using the method in Section 3.1. Then, with high probability 5 the value of ¦Á is close to its expectation, where the probabilities are over random choices of the activation times.</p><p>which is o(1) for ¦Ë = ¦Ø( ¡Ì n). To compute the value of E[Na] we have to be a bit more careful, since a node can contribute multiple time periods to Na. First, note that we have to count also the neighbors of the nodes in W . Recall that W = {w1, . . . , w }, is the set of active nodes and their neighbors.</p><p>Let us write Na = Proof. The main part of the proof is Lemma 2 where we show that the values of Ya and Na are concentrated. This is proved using concentration inequalities for martingales. We can then show (details deferred for the full version of the work) that when we apply logistic regression with inputs that are close to each other, the social correlation values ¦Á recovered are also close to each other.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Detecting influence</head><p>We showed that the values of ¦Á that we obtain with the correlation model are close to each other with high probability with and without the timestep shuffle. Now we contrast this with the influence model and we show that in the latter case the values of ¦Á that we compute with and without the timestep shuffle are in general different. We demonstrate this fact with a simple example. Consider a line graph with n + 1 nodes, v0, v1, v2, . . . , vn, and edge set the {(vi, vi+1); i = 0, 2, . . . , n ? 1}. For simplicity we assume that that node v0 is has initially used a tag; this does not change the nature of our example. For some p ¡Ê [0, 1], consider now the influence model with ¦Á = log 2 (p/(1 ? p)) and ¦Â = 0, and we observe the system for T time steps (with T p being sufficiently small, say T p &lt; n/2). During the T steps, the nodes will start to use the tags from left to right, and at each step, the probability that the leftmost inactive node will become active equals p. Then at the end of the T steps, if the number of new active nodes is denoted by L,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">we have E[Y1] = E[L] = T p and E[N1] = T (1 ? p).</formula><p>Assume now that we perform the shuffle test. Then for i = 1, . . . , L, let Y In this section we introduce the second test for distinguishing influence similar to the one used in the obesity study <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>: we reverse the direction of all the edges and run logistic regression on the data using the new graph (which we call the reverse graph) as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . Since other forms of social correlation (other than social influence) are only based on the fact that two friends often share common characteristics or are affected by the same external variables and are independent of which of these two individuals has named the other as a friend, we intuitively expect reversing the edges not to change our estimate of the social correlation significantly. On the other hand, social influence spreads in the direction specified by the edges of the graph, and hence reversing the edges should intuitively change the estimate of the correlation. We will test this hypothesis on several classes of instances generated using probabilistic models of different forms of social correlation. To verify the validity of the techniques described in Section 3, we define three generative models one corresponding to a setting where there is no social correlation, one corresponding to a setting that there is only social influence and one that there is social correlation but not influence. In each model, we will try to keep other aspects of the model as close to Flickr's data as possible. In particular, in all models the network (both number of users and connections) grows at the same rate as in the real Flickr data, and we will try to let the number of users that become active in each time step to follow the pattern corresponding to a tag in the real data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">SIMULATIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Generative models</head><p>The first model concerns a setting where there is no social correlation-influence or otherwise-in the pattern of activations. The second model is for a setting where influence is the only form of social correlation; this model is defined to match the logistic regression model described earlier. The third model seeks to capture situations where agents that are close to each other in the network are affected by the same external factors (the environment) that make them more likely to be activated. We now describe the models.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">T E[N v 1 ] = 1 T ¡¤ i T p ¡¤ i 2 ? 1 . i=1</formula><p>This follows since node vi becomes active at time step i with probability 1/T , the probability that node vi?1 arrives before is i/T p and in that case the arrival time is uniformly distributed in <ref type="bibr">[0, i]</ref> so the expected number of times that node vi does not become active is i/2 ? 1. Therefore,</p><p>The no-correlation model. For every tag in the real data, we can generate a no-correlation instance as follows: the network grows exactly in the same way as in the real data.</p><p>In each time step, we look at the real data to see how many new agents use the tag, and pick the same number of agents uniformly at random from the set of agents that have already joined the network and have not been picked yet.</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">E[N v 1 ] = (T + 1)(2T ? 5) 12T p ,</formula><p>and so,</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">E[N1] = (T + 1)(2T ? 5) 12 .</formula><p>Hence we see that the input to the regression function is in general very different and as a result the values of ¦Á will in general be very different.</p><p>The influence model. This model is parameterized in terms of two parameters, ¦Á and ¦Â. The network, and the growth pattern of the network is kept as in the real data. In every time step, each node in the set of nodes that has joined the network but not activated yet flips a coin independently to decide if to become active in this time step. The probability of activation for this node is computed using <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2)</ref>, where a is the number of friends of this node that have become active in one of the previous time steps.   The correlation (no-influence) model. Again, we keep the network and the pattern of growth of the population the same as in the real data. The model is parameterized in terms of one parameter L, and follows the pattern of a given tag in the real data. Before generating the action data, we select a set S of nodes by sequentially picking a number of centers at random, and adding a ball of radius 2 around each to S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> We stop this process as soon as the size of S reaches the prespecified number L. Then, we generate the set of agents that become active in each time step in a manner similar to the one in the no-correlation model, except that in each time step we pick the set of agents to become active uniformly at random from S.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Measuring correlation</head><p>Our first set of experiments focuses on the measurement of correlation in the network. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 1</ref> we display the results of the application of logistic regression to the no-correlation model. We can see that the distribution of the values of ¦Á is centered at zero and most of the mass is around there.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 2</ref> we can see the application of the logistic regression to the influence model. Recall from Section 3 that this model is based on the logistic function, which we are trying to fit. Not surprisingly, we recover the values of ¦Á that we set in our model. Thus, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 2</ref> essentially displays those values of ¦Á.</p><p>Finally, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 3</ref> we see the results in the correlation model. Note that here as well the values of ¦Á that we recover are positive. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 4</ref>(a) we can observe the results for some of the tags. Notice how the cumulative density function (CDF) is shifted to the left, which means that when we reverse the edges the value of ¦Á decreases. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 4</ref>(b) we can see the values in absolute terms. Now we switch to the correlation model. According to the analytical findings of Section 3.2, the values of ¦Á that we obtain with and without the shuffling should not differ with high probability. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 5</ref> confirms our analytical findings and shows that for almost all tags the values of ¦Á retrieved are very close with and without the shuffle.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">EXPERIMENTS ON REAL DATA</head><p>After verifying that our techniques are effective for the simulated data, we apply them on real-world data, namely on the Flickr social network. First we describe the data set. Then we show that there is positive correlation in the users' behavior. Finally, we address the issue of the source of correlation. We apply the tests of Section 3, and we conclude that influence is not a likely source of the correlation.  We analyzed the tagging behavior of users for a period of 16 months. The final number of users was about 800K. Since the majority of users did not exhibit any tagging behavior at all, we restricted our attention to the set of users who have tagged any photo with any tag, which is about 340K users. Looking at this subgraph at the end of the 16-month period, the size of the giant component is 160K users, the second one has size 16, and there are 165K isolated users.</p></div>

We selected tags of various types (event, colors, objects, etc.), various numbers of users (most of them were used by more than 1, 000 users), and various growth patterns: bursty (e.g., "halloween,""katrina"), smooth (e.g., "photos,") and periodic (e.g., "moon").</p></div>

In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 10</ref>(a), notice that the two cumulative distribution functions essentially coincide.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Some influence in Flickr</head><p>While it is true that influence does not play an important role in users' tagging behavior in Flickr, we can actually discover that there is some limited effect by looking at the difference between similar tags. As a concrete example, consider the tag "graffiti"; the difference between the values of ¦Á in the two edge directions is essentially 0. A lot of users used the misspelled tag "grafitti." Here the difference turns out to be slightly larger (still small though). It is easy to imagine that indeed there is some propagation of the misspelled version. (The analogy with the TA who grades two homeworks with the same mistakes should make this concept clear!) Finally, with a third, even less common spelling ("graffitti"), the difference increased yet more. marketing technologies to shape the future of marketing on the Internet, this and many other related questions are of tremendous practical value.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We thank Alex Jaffe, Malcolm Slaney, and Duncan Watts for invaluable discussions, as well as the anonymous reviewers for insightful comments.</p><p>In this paper we applied statistical analysis on the data from a large social system in order to identify and measure social influence as a source of correlation between the actions of individuals with social ties. This is an instance of the age-old problem of distinguishing correlation from causation. This problem is very difficult in general; however, in our case, we used the availability of data about the time-step of each action, as well as asymmetric social ties between the agents in order to study this problem.</p><p>There are still many interesting open directions left for future research. First, our techniques provide only a qualitative indication of the existence of influence and not a quantitative measure. Furthermore, we do not provide any formal verification of our results. For example, is it indeed the case that in Flickr users' tagging behavior, influence has a limited role? Or, can we pinpoint social networks and behaviors where influence is indeed prevalent and verify our tests? Also, what happens when different sources of social correlation are present, as is usually the case? All these important questions might be tricky to answer and probably require the design of controlled user experiments. Furthermore, it would be very interesting to extend our theoretical model for distinguishing between social influence and other forms of correlation in social networks. Under what conditions the information about the time step of events is enough to achieve this goal? How can the pattern of the "spread" of an action be used to identify social influence even in a setting where all social ties are symmetric? How can we find an "influential" node just by looking at the data about the spread of an action?
