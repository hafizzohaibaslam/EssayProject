			<abstract>
				<p>Previous work on analysis of friendship networks has identified ways in which graph features can be used for prediction of link existence and persistence, and shown that features of user pairs such as shared interests can marginally improve the precision and recall of link prediction. This marginal improvement has, to date, been severely limited by the flat representation used for interest taxonomies. We present an approach towards integration of such graph features with ontology-enriched numerical and nominal features (based on interest hierarchies) and on itemset size-sensitive associations found using interest data. A test bed previously developed using the social network and weblogging service LiveJournal is extended using this integrative approach. Our results show how this semantically integrative approach to link mining yields a boost in precision and recall of known friendships when applied to this test bed. We conclude with a discussion of link-dependent features and how an integrative constructive induction framework can be extended to incorporate temporal fluents for link prediction, interest prediction, and annotation in social networks. of users to thousands [HLP+07] and applying association rule mining to construct features useful in estimating link probability and strength [AHB+08].</p>

Application of the framework to incorporate semantic metadata regarding user profiles: specifically, schemas describing eligible interests and memberships that a pair of candidate users can have in common</p><p>This paper presents an integrative, ontology-enriched framework for link prediction in social networks. The framework combines previously-developed approaches for feature construction and classification -namely, computing topological graph features <ref type="bibr">[HKP+06]</ref>, shared membership counts <ref type="bibr">[BCA+08]</ref>, and aggregates across all shared memberships <ref type="bibr">[AHB+08]</ref>. It augments them with a ontology extraction mechanism based on partitioning and agglomerative hierarchical clustering.</p><p>[BCA+08] This mechanism extends our feature construction task to a more general one of feature extraction, while enabling it to handle diverse memberships, such as: interests that a user can hold, communities he or she can belong to, etc. Previous work has focused more on scaling up the algorithms for graph feature construction from hundreds 4. Feature selection, extraction, and discovery methods that are sensitive to recommendation context and able to leverage the above metadata 5. Development of data description languages using description logics that can capture fluents such as set identity over time</p><p>We first define our link prediction framework, then the holistic framework for ontology-enriched classification.</p><p>Next, we describe our social network test bed in brief, and report new positive results after extending the framework along the first aspect above. Finally, we discuss the data integration and modeling operations needed to implement the other four using present-day social networks and Semantic Web representations such as OWL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Friendship Networks in Social Networks</head><p>Most social networking services include friend-listing mechanisms that allow users to link to others, indicating friends and associates. Friendship networks do not necessarily entail that these users know one another, but are means of expressing and controlling trust, particularly access to private content. In blogging services such as SUP's LiveJournal or Xanga, this content centers on text but comprises several media, including: interactive quizzes, voice posts, embedded images, and video hosted by other services such as YouTube. In personal photograph-centric social networks such as News Corporation's MySpace, Facebook, Google's Orkut, and Yahoo's Flickr, links can be annotated ("How do you know this person?") and friends can be prioritized ("top friends" lists) or granted privileges as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>[HKP+06, HLP+07] and persistence <ref type="bibr">[HWP08]</ref>, have been applied to social networks such as LiveJournal. This approach is based on inductive generalization over three types of features:</p><p>1. node-dependent: specific to a user u to whom a friend is being recommended, or to a recommended user v 2. pair-dependent: based on co-membership of u and v in a domain-specific set (see below) 3. link-dependent: .based on annotation of known relationships, or aggregation between them in the entity-relational data modeling sense</p><p>Examples of pair-dependent attributes include measures of overlap among common:</p><p>? interests ? communities, forums, groups ? fandoms (fan of), endorsements (supporter of) ? institutions (schools, colleges and universities, companies, etc.)</p><p>Measures of overlap depend on the abstract data type of the attributes. For interests, communities, fandoms, and endorsements, they are most often simple counts -that is, the size of the intersection of two users' membership sets, computed by string comparison. Overlap can, however, be a weighted sum of similarity measures between concepts; our focus in this paper is the development and application of concept hierarchies based on such measures. For institutions, the base types for computing overlap can be intervals -typically, the time periods that two people were both at a university or company. Some vertical social networks such as LinkedIn, Classmates.com, and MyFamily.com specialize in certain types of links, such as those between colleagues, past employers and employees, classmates, and relatives. As in vertical search and vertical portal applications, this specialization determines many aspects of the data model, data integration, and user knowledge elicitation tasks. For example, LinkedIn's friend invitation process requires users to specify their relationship to the invited friend, an optional or post-hoc step in many other social networks.</p><p>Most features for link prediction are node-dependent or pair-dependent. For example, Hsu et al. derived seven topological graph features and five interest-related features of potential relevance to link existence prediction in LiveJournal's directed friendship network.</p><p>[HKP+06] They then used supervised inductive learning over pairs of candidate features known to be within two degrees of separation to find discriminators between direct friends and "friend of a friend" (FOAF) pairs within a limited LiveJournal friendship graph, initially containing 1000 users <ref type="bibr">[HKP+06]</ref> that was later extended to 4000 users <ref type="bibr">[HLP+07]</ref>. In later work [HWP08], they extended the "friend vs. FOAF" task to predicting day-by-day link persistence in a time series of repeated web crawls.</p><p>Friendship links can be undirected, as in Facebook and LinkedIn (requiring reciprocation, also known as confirmation, to confer access privileges) or directed, as in LiveJournal (not necessarily requiring reciprocation).</p><p>Computation of topological graph features, such as the degree of separation (shortest path length) between a pair of users, can yield information such as alternative paths as a side effect. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> illustrates one use of such information in the professional social network LinkedIn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Prediction Tasks: Link Existence and Persistence</head><p>Link analysis techniques, such as supervised learning of classification functions for predicting link existence</p><p>In this paper, we focus on link existence prediction between users and between interests. The task is formulated as follows: given a graph consisting of all other extant links, specify for a given pair (u, v) that are either friend (distance 1) or FOAF (distance 2), the true distance. For user-to-user links, our experiments are conducted using this "friend vs. FOAF" task over a 1000-node LiveJournal data set created by Hsu et al. We seek to improve the precision and recall of link existence prediction beyond that achieved using node-dependent and pair-dependent features on flat interest hierarchies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHODOLOGY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Ontology-Aware Link Mining</head><p>Figure 2. Minimal-length paths for a third-degree connected pair in LinkedIn. ? 2008 LinkedIn, Inc.</p><p>Hsu et al. reported a near-baseline accuracy of 88.5% and very low precision of 4.5 -5.4% for the LiveJournal link existence prediction task using shared interests alone.</p><p>[HPL+07] They report that adding shared interests to graph features yielded an incremental improvement of 6.5% in precision (from 83.0% to 89.5%) for decision trees, which achieved the best baseline and final precision on cross-validation data. This illustrates that using literal string equality to compute "similarity of interest sets" between two users does not result in effective features for predicting link existence in the friends network of LiveJournal. We hypothesized that this was due to the semantically limited similarity measure and that a measure based on an ontology, such as a concept hierarchy of interests as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>, would yield further improvement.</p><p>[BCA+08]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Link Mining</head><p>Link mining refers to the problem of finding and analyzing associations between entities in order to infer and annotate relationships. It may therefore require data modeling, integration, and mining by means of machine learning from known or putative links. The links can be user-specified, as for the social networks discussed earlier in this section, or latent for text information extraction tasks such as that of <ref type="bibr">McCallum et al. [MWC07]</ref>, who used the Enron e-mail corpus to infer roles and topic categories. For a much more complete survey of link mining approaches that emphasizes statistical relational learning approaches and graphical models, we refer the interested reader to Getoor and Diehl [GD05].</p><p>Ketkar et al.</p><p>[KHC05] compare data mining techniques over graph-based representations of links to first-order and relational representations and learning techniques that are based upon inductive logic programming (ILP). Sarkar and Moore <ref type="bibr">[SM05]</ref> extend the analysis of social networks into the temporal dimension by modeling change in link structure across discrete time steps, using latent space models and multidimensional scaling. One of the challenges in collecting time series data from LiveJournal is the slow rate of data acquisition, just as spatial annotation data (such as that found in LJ maps and the "plot your friends on a map" meme) is sparse. ? nominal: measured for grouped relationships for a candidate pair of entities by name (e.g., are u and v both interested in topics under the category of mobile computing?) ? numerical: interestingness measures that are computed across these grouped relationships (e.g., how many interests that u is interested does v share, and how rare are these interests?)</p><p>All features in these two categories are examples of pairdependent co-membership features as discussed in Section ? 2.2, and can be computed using the ontology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Nominal Features: Abstraction using Ontologies</head><p>As in many social networks, the number of distinct interests in LiveJournal ranges from thousands to hundreds of thousands as the number of users grows. The bit vector for all "shared interests" between users becomes so large and sparse that for nominal interests it is only feasible to use an ontology. Rather than continue to use literal string equality, which results in this overly stringent and sparse representation, we clustered interests to form a concept hierarchy and used the aggregate distance measure between user interests to more accurately determine their degree of interest overlap.</p><p>abstract ancestor in the concept hierarchy before computing the nominal features (a bit vector).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 5. Example of clusters found using Hierarchical</head><p>Agglomerative and Divisive (HAD) algorithm. Interestingness measures are descriptive statistics computed over rules of the form u ¡ú v, which in our application denotes that "when u holds an interest, then v also holds that interest". This allows us to apply algorithms for association rule (AR) mining based on calculation of frequent itemsets, which by analogy with market basket analysis denote sets of users who are all interested in one topic. Each interestingness measure captures one or more desiderata of a data mining system: novelty (surprisingness), validity (precision, recall, accuracy), expected utility, and comprehensibility (semantic value).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Numerical Features: Estimation by Association</head><p>The actual hierarchy consisted of single-word concepts formed from individual terms; LiveJournal allows up to four 15-character terms per interest. The similarity metric used for clustering was the number of matching terms in a unified definition set obtained as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>: each term of an interest was looked up in WordNet-Online, the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), and Amazon Associates' Web Service (AWS). Hierarchical Agglomerative and Divisive (HAD) clustering, a hybrid bottom-up linkage-based and divisive (partitional) algorithm, was used to generate the hierarchy. The output, consisting of 19 clusters, is summarized in <ref type="figure">Figure  5</ref>; note that the level of abstraction can be manually set, as we do in our experiments. We refer the interested reader to Bahirwani <ref type="bibr">[Ba08]</ref> for additional details of the clustering algorithm and documentation on the data sources consulted.</p><p>We use the count of common interests, plus eight normalized AR interestingness measures over common interests, as numerical friendship prediction features. Each measure is a statistic over the set common interests of u and v, and expressed as a function of the rule u ¡ú v. Our link existence prediction system uses, as a baseline, the computed graph features specified by <ref type="bibr">Hsu et al. [HKP+06]</ref>. To this we add nominal features: one Boolean value for each pair of interests in the Cartesian product of those for a user u and a user v. This is computed by first clustering single interest keywords to build a concept hierarchy, then mapping each interest of u and v to its 8. Accuracy (u ¡ú v) = P ¨ª ?¨ª¡À?, ¨ª ?¨ª¡À? + P ?¨ª ?¨ª¡À?, ?¨ª ?¨ª¡À? 9. Leverage (u ¡ú v) = P ¨ª ?¨ª¡À? ¨ª ?¨ª¡À? ? P ¨ª ?¨ª¡À? P(¨ª ?¨ª¡À?) A normalization step is used to sensitize the AR mining algorithm to the popularity of interests, which is measured by the sizes of itemsets. Intuitively, it is more significant for two candidate users to share rare interests than popular ones, a property which gives itemset size a particular semantic significance in this application domain. For the derivation of a parametric normalization function, we refer the interested reader to <ref type="bibr">Aljandal et al. [AHP+08]</ref> three inductive learning algorithms with the highest ROC-AUC. Each was trained using graph, nominal, and numerical features computed without the ontology. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table  2</ref> lists the same results with the ontology. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EXPERIMENT DESIGN</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Link Prediction: 1000-user LiveJournal Data Set</head><p>We used the 1000-user data set developed by Hsu et al.</p><p>[HLP+07], which includes about 22000 unique interests that are shared by at least two users. (Interests held by only one user are of no interest for link prediction, so singleton itemsets are pruned as is often done in frequent itemset mining.) As mentioned in Section ? 3.2, these are clustered using the HAD algorithm to form 19 clusters, resulting in 19 + 19 = 38 nominal features for every candidate pair (u, v). To these we add the original 7 graph features and the 9 numerical features. This integrated data set incorporates all of the ontology-enhanced</p><p>We evaluated the nominal and numerical features using five classifier models and inductive learning algorithms: support vector machines (SVM), Logistic Classification, Random Forests, decision trees (J48), and decision stumps (OneR). <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref> list the results for SVM and Logistic Classification, which achieved the highest ROC-AUC score using all available features.</p><p>[Ba08] The overall highest AUC was achieved using numerical features along with Logistic Classification, although the precision is still improved by the inclusion of nominal features.  In future work, we will examine how to extend the framework to incorporate multi-word interests and technical definitions. Other memberships listed in Section ? 2.2 may also benefit from ontology discovery -especially <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the precision, recall, F-score and area under the specificity-sensitivity curve (ROC-AUC) for the fandoms and communities, which have their own description pages and metadata in most social networks. The association rule mining approach and the semantics of itemset size extend naturally to these domains, making these a promising area for exploration of ontology-aware classification. To be able to account for the relationship between membership popularity and significance towards link existence, however, it will be important for our feature discovery methods to capture some domainspecific semantics of links and itemset membership. For example, we do not expect that itemset size normalization methods will apply in all market basket analysis domains, even though they seem to be effective in some social networks. Finally, returning to the LinkedIn example in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, an ontology that includes temporal fluents such as part-of ("Blogger became part of Google in 2004") and use them to infer relational fluents ("u and v have been Google employees since 2004") will allow us to construct semantically richer feature sets that we believe will be more useful for link existence and persistence prediction. </p></div>
