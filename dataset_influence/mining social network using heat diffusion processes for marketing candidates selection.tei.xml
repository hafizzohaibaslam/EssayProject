				<p>Social Network Marketing techniques employ pre-existing social networks to increase brands or products awareness through word-of-mouth promotion. Full understanding of social network marketing and the potential candidates that can thus be marketed to certainly offer lucrative opportunities for prospective sellers. Due to the complexity of social networks, few models exist to interpret social network marketing realistically. We propose to model social network marketing using Heat Diffusion Processes. This paper presents three diffusion models, along with three algorithms for selecting the best individuals to receive marketing samples. These approaches have the following advantages to best illustrate the properties of real-world social networks: (1) We can plan a marketing strategy sequentially in time since we include a time factor in the simulation of product adoptions; (2) The algorithm of selecting marketing candidates best represents and utilizes the clustering property of real-world social networks; and (3) The model we construct can diffuse both positive and negative comments on products or brands in order to simulate the complicated communications within social networks. Our work represents a novel approach to the analysis of social network marketing, and is the first work to propose how to defend against negative comments within social networks. Complexity analysis shows our model is also scalable to very large social networks .</p>

CIKM'08, <ref type="bibr">October 26-30, 2008</ref> Unlike the traditional social network, online social networks have a number of important distinguishing features. Massive quantities of data are available on online social network sites, blogs, knowledge sharing sites, collaborative filtering systems, newsgroups, email systems, etc. Millions of users participate in these social networks, and act as different roles. All of these social networks provide valuable information for decision-making in marketing campaigns, especially in marketing of new products from start-up businesses. Several successful examples, like Hotmail, Google, MySpace, etc. have already shown the powerful abilities of social network marketing. Full understanding of social network marketing and the potential customers that can thus be reached certainly offer lucrative opportunities for prospective sellers.</p><p>Research into how information flows in a social network started from a book called "Diffusion of Innovations" by Rogers <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Rogers formalized that adopters of any new innovation could be categorized as innovators (2.5%), early adopters (13.5%), early majority (34%), late majority (34%) and laggards (16%). Some similar work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> also focuses on developing theories of innovation adoption.</p><p>Many researchers started to analyze the diffusion process in terms of "word-of-mouth" marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, since "word-of-mouth" advertising can be much more effective than traditional marketing methods. Although these studies made great contributions to the analysis of innovation diffusions, they were descriptive, rather than predictive -they are built at a very coarse level, typically with only a few global parameters, and are not useful for making actual predictions of the future behavior of the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>In view of the subsequent exponential growth of online social network resources, researchers now have more data to investigate and model the dynamics of viral marketing, the innovation adoption problem and the information diffusion process <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, authors attempt to compute customers' network value as well as the intrinsic value of customers. They focused on the following problem: given a potential social network of consumers, if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>? Although simulations showed their work can help companies achieve much more revenue than direct marketing, several remaining problems still need to be studied, which we will introduce in the next section. Song et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> proposed leveraging users' access patterns to model information flow and generate effective personalized recommendations. Their later work <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> proposed an information flow model that leverages diffusion rates for identifying where information should flow to and identifying who will most quickly receive the information.</p><p>A social network is a very complex network with all kinds of messages flowing within it. Modeling social network marketing realistically is an extremely difficult problem. Aiming at the limitations of previous work, we propose a social network marketing framework which utilizes the heat diffusion theory from Physics to describe the diffusion of innovations. These heat diffusion models provide our work with the following contributions: (1) Due to the time-dependent property of the heat diffusion process, our model can simulate product adoptions step by step, which helps marketing companies divide their marketing strategies into several phases. (2) Marketing candidates selection algorithms based on the diffusion models can best represent the clustering coefficient property of real-world social networks. The approximation algorithm is proved to be within a good bound of the optimum solution. (3) Every consumer or customer in social networks can not only diffuse positive comments on products but also can influence others with negative comments even if those others have already adopted those products themselves. Our model captures this important feature of social networks, which has not been studied extensively in previous work, and provides suggestion on planing marketing strategies.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We review related work in Section 2. Section 3 proposes several heat diffusion models. In Section 4, we provide three marketing candidates selection algorithms. Section 5 gives the complexity analysis of our proposed models and algorithms. In Section 6, we demonstrate the empirical analysis of our models and algorithms. Finally, conclusions and future work are given in Section 7. reality, and it ignores the network structure, which could significantly influence the diffusion process <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, in order to help companies determine which potential customers to market to, Domingos and Richardson <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> proposed a fundamental algorithm to model customers' network value as well as the intrinsic value of the customer. The customer's network value is defined as the expected profit from sales to other customers this customer may influence to buy, the customers those may influence, and so on recursively.</p><p>Although simulations show their work can help companies achieve much more revenue than direct marketing, several remaining problems still need to be studied. First, Domingos and Richardson considered making marketing decisions at a specific point in time, whilst in practice, the adoptions of a product by customers happen at different time with different interventions. The time aspect needs to be considered when modeling social network marketing since the social network is evolving from time to time. Second, their work ignores the negative influence of every customer. In practice, one customer will have a negative influence on others (neighbors) if this customer does not like this product. Third, in reality, marketing to individuals with the highest network values is not an appropriate choice since these peoples maybe come from the same community of a social network. The best strategy is to choose marketing candidates from different communities.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, Song et al. proposed to model users' adoption patterns as an information flow network for a recommendation system. An Early Adoption Based Information Flow (EABIF) network model and a Topic-sensitive Early Adoption Based Information Flow (TEABIF) network model were proposed. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Song et al.</ref> proposed another information flow model that captures the diffusion rates of information in a network. These two models are well defined, and especially useful for problems in recommendation and ranking. However, these two models need additional data on users' profiles, access patterns, login logs, or purchase logs, which may not always be available.</p></div>

A tremendous expansion has occurred in the marketing literature on diffusion since the 1970s. The most important single impetus to this scholarly explosion is a model for forecasting the diffusion of new consumer products proposed by Frank Bass in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The Bass model characterizes the spread of a new product and technology in a market by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N (t) = N (t?1)+p(m?N (t?1)+q N (t ? 1) m (m?N (t?1)),</formula><p>where N (t) is the cumulative number of adopters by time t; the parameter m is the market potential, indicating the total number of people who will eventually adopt the item; the coefficient p is called the coefficient of innovation, indicating the external influence or advertising effect; and the coefficient q is called the coefficient of imitation, indicating internal influence or word-of-mouth effect. However, the Bass model is an overly simplified representation of a complex Heat diffusion is a physical phenomenon. In a medium, heat always flows from a position with high temperature to a position with low temperature. Recently, heat diffusionbased approaches have been successfully applied in various domains such as classification and dimensionality reduction problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> approximated the heat kernel for a multinomial family in a closed form, from which great improvements were obtained over the use of Gaussian or linear kernels. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Kondor et al.</ref> proposed the use of a discrete diffusion kernel for categorical data, and showed that the simple diffusion kernel on the hypercube can result in good performance for such data. Belkin et al. employed a heat kernel to construct the weight of a neighborhood graph, and apply it to a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, Yang et al. proposed a ranking algorithm known as the DiffusionRank using heat diffusion process; simulations showed that it is very robust to Web spamming.</p><p>In this paper, we model diffusion of innovations as processes of heat diffusion. Actually, the process of people influencing others is very similar to the heat diffusion phenomenon. In a social network, the innovators and early adopters of a product or innovation act as heat sources, and  Heat Curve of Node 1 Heat Curve of Node 2 Heat Curve of Nodes 3, 4, 5 ence fj (t) ? fi(t). Moreover, the heat flows from node j to node i through the pipe that connects nodes i and j. Based on this consideration, we assume that M (i, j, t, ?t) = ¦Á(fj (t) ? fi(t))?t, where ¦Á is the thermal conductivity-the heat diffusion coefficient. As a result, the heat difference at node i between time t + ?t and time t will be equal to the sum of the heat that it receives from all its neighbors. This is formulated as: </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(fj (t) ? fi(t)),<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">j:(v j ,v i )¡ÊE</formula><p>where E is the set of edges. To find a closed form solution to Eq. (2), we express it in a matrix form:</p><p>have a very high amount of heat. These peoples start to influence others, and diffuse their influence to the early majority, then the late majority. Finally, at a certain time point, heat is diffused to the margin of this social network, and the laggards adopt this product or innovation.</p><p>The heat flows throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">f(t + ?t) ? f(t) ?t = ¦ÁHf(t),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">? ?

The heat kernel Kt(x, y) describes the heat distribution at time t diffusing from the initial unit heat source at position y, and thus describes the connectivity (which is considered as a kind of similarity) between x and y. However, it is very difficult to represent the social network as a regular geometry with a known dimension. This motivates us to investigate the heat flow on a graph. The graph is considered as an approximation to the underlying manifold, and so the heat flow on the graph is considered as an approximation to the heat flow on the manifold.</p><p>In this paper, we model a social network as a graph, and each consumer or customer in the social network is defined as a node on this graph. The relationships between peoples are represented by edges that connect nodes. We propose three different diffusion models to describe different social networks: undirected social networks, directed social networks and directed social networks with prior knowledge of their diffusion probabilities.</p><p>Solving this differential equation, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">f(t) = e ¦ÁtH f(0),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where d(v) denotes the degree of the node v, and e ¦ÁtH could be extended as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">2 3 e ¦ÁtH = I + ¦ÁtH + ¦Á 2 t 2! H 2 + ¦Á 3 t 3! H 3 + ¡¤ ¡¤ ¡¤ .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The matrix e ¦ÁtH is called the diffusion kernel in the sense that the heat diffusion process continues infinitely many times from the initial heat diffusion.</p><p>In order to interpret Eq. (6) and the heat diffusion process more intuitively, we construct a small undirected social network graph with only five consumers as showed in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 1(a)</ref>.</p><p>Initially, at time zero, suppose node 1 is given 3 units of heat, and node 2 is given 2 units of heat; then the vector</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">f(0) equals [3, 2, 0, 0, 0] T . The entries in matrix H are ? ? H = ? ? ? ?4 1 1 1 1 1 ?1 0 0 0 1 0 ?1 0 0 1 0 0 ?1 0 1 0 0 0 ?1 ? ? ? .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Diffusion on Undirected Social Networks</head><p>Consider an undirected social network graph G = (V, E), where V is the vertex set, and V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}. E = {(vi, vj ) | there is an edge from vi to vj } is the set of all edges. The edge (vi, vj ) is considered as a pipe that connects nodes vi and vj . The value fi(t) describes the heat at node vi at time t, beginning from an initial distribution of heat given by fi(0) at time zero. f(t) denotes the vector consisting of fi(t).</p><p>We construct our model as follows. Suppose, at time t, each node i receives an amount M (i, j, t, ?t) heat from its neighbor j during a period ?t. The heat M (i, j, t, ?t) should be proportional to the time period ?t and the heat differWithout loss of generality, we set the thermal conductivity ¦Á = 1, and vary time t from 0 to 1 with a step of 0.05. The curve for the amount of heat at each node with time is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>(b). We can see that, as time passes, the heat sources node 1 and node 2 will diffuse their heat to nodes 3, 4, and 5. The heat of nodes 3, 4, and 5 will increase respectively, and the trends of their heat curves are the same since these three nodes are symmetric in this graph. Now we can interpret this figure in the aspect of social network marketing. Node 1 and node 2 are two consumers representing innovators or early adopters, who influence their direct neighbors in this social network, and to diffuse innovations to others. Eventually, nodes 3, 4, and 5 are successfully influenced by nodes 1 and 2 step by step as time elapses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Diffusion on Directed Social Networks</head><p>The above heat diffusion model is designed for undirected social networks, but in many situations, the social network graphs are directed, especially in online recommender systems or knowledge sharing sites. Every user in knowledge sharing sites always has a trust list. The users in the trust list will influence this user deeply. These relationships are directed since user a is in the trust list of user b, but user b might not be in the trust list of user a. Based on this consideration, we modify the heat diffusion model on an undirected social network as follows.</p><p>On a directed graph G(V, E), in the pipe (vi, vj ), heat flows only from vi to vj . Suppose at time t, each node vi receives RH = RH(i, j, t, ?t) amount of heat from vj during a period of ?t. We have three assumptions: (1) RH should be proportional to the time period ?t; (2) RH should be proportional to the heat at node vj ; and (3) RH is zero if there is no link from vj to vi. As a result, vi will receive j:(v j ,v i )¡ÊE ¦Òjfj (t)?t amount of heat from all its neighbors that points to it.</p><p>At the same time, node vi diffuses DH(i, t, ?t) amount of heat to its subsequent nodes. We assume that: (1) The heat DH(i, t, ?t) should be proportional to the time period ?t; (2) The heat DH(i, t, ?t) should be proportional to the heat at node vi; (3) Each node has the same ability to diffuse heat; (4) The heat DH(i, t, ?t) should be uniformly distributed to its subsequent nodes. The real situation is more complex than this, in view of the dynamic environment of social networks, but we have to simplify these in order to make our model concise. As a result, node vi will diffuse ¦Áfi(t)?t/di amount of heat to each of its subsequent nodes, and each of its subsequent nodes should receive ¦Áfi(t)?t/di amount of heat, where di is the outdegree of node i. Therefore ¦Òj = ¦Á/dj . In the case that the outdegree of node i equals zero, we assume that this node will not diffuse heat to others. To sum up, the heat difference at node vi between time t + ?t and t will be equal to the sum of the heat that it receives, deducted by what it diffuses. This is formulated as Consider a directed graph G = {V, E, P }, where V is the vertex set, and V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}. P = {pij | where pij is the probability that edge <ref type="bibr">(vi, vj )</ref> exists}. E = {(vi, vj ) | there is an edge from vi to vj and pij &gt; 0} is the set of all edges. If we consider a more general case, we could also include the parameter that describes each person's personality. Some individuals in the social network are very active and willing to share everything they like or dislike to their friends. On the other hand, some individuals are inactive with regard to diffusing innovation to others. We employ ¦Ø to describe the personality factor of each person.</p><p>According to the above analysis and the analysis in Section 3.2, the expected heat difference at node i between time t + ?t and time t will be equal to the sum of the heat that it receives from all its neighbors. This is formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">fi(t + ?t) ? fi(t) ?t = ? ? ¦Á ¦Ói¦Øi di fi(t) p ik + ? ? ¦Øjpji dj fj (t) ? , (10) k:(v i ,v k )¡ÊE j:(v j ,v i )¡ÊE</formula><p>where ¦Ói is a flag to identify whether node i has any outlinks. The parameters diffusion probability p and personality factor ¦Ø can be any value in the range <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref>.

Information on hot online social network sites and blogs will transfer information faster than other types of social networks. At the same time, different types of information also have different values of ¦Á.

In the real case, due to limited time and enthusiasm, each person will not diffuse innovation to everyone in his (her) contact list. For example, if you find Gmail or Hotmail is very useful, you probably will tell your best friends or some of your friends who may need this service, but not all of your friends. This consideration motivates us to propose our third heat diffusion model on directed social networks with prior knowledge of diffusion probabilities.</p><p>In most cases, each company has a certain quota of product which is used for marketing candidates selection. These products will be delivered to some pre-selected consumers at a discount or totally free. Supposing we have data on a social network which has N individuals, the problem we need to solve is: given the quota number k, how to choose the initial k "influential" individuals who will be delivered a free sample product, in order to maximize the number of cascade adoptions by which these individuals will influence other individuals on their direct contact list.</p><p>In this paper, we model social network marketing using heat diffusion processes. Initially, we choose k individuals as the seeds for heat diffusion, denoted by a set S k , and give a certain amount of heat h0 to each individual. At time zero of the heat diffusion process, we set fi(0) = h0, where i ¡Ê S k . As time elapses, the heat will diffuse through the whole social network. If the amount of heat of individual i at time t is greater than or equal to a threshold ¦È, this individual i will be considered as having been successfully influenced by others, and will adopt the product. We define the influence set of a set of k individuals S k , denoted as IS k (t), to be the expected number of individuals who will adopt the product at time t. Now the above problem could be interpreted as: finding the most influential k size set S k to maximize the size of set IS k (t) at time t, where IS k (t) = {i | fi(t) ¡Ý ¦È, i ¡Ü N }.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">k-Step Greedy Algorithm</head><p>Algorithm 1 is very naive since it ignores the potential overlaps of top-k influential sets. We therefore propose a greedy algorithm to minimize the overlaps between top-k influential sets, as follows: (1) First calculate the influence set of each individual, and set U = {I1(t), I2(t), . . . , IN (t)}; (2) set R = ?, each time choose the set Ii(t), i ¡Ü N to maximize the size of {Ii(t) ?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Enhanced k-Step Greedy Algorithm</head><p>In Algorithm 2, we first compute the influence set of each individual in turn, then choose the k sets with maximum coverage. In reality, at the beginning of the innovation diffusion process, several diffusion sources (innovators or early adopters) in the network diffuse the innovation at the same time, not just one single source.

In most cases, P = 30 is enough for approximating the heat diffusion equation. The complexity O(P M ) shows that our heat diffusion algorithm has very good performance in scalability since it is linear with respect to the number of edges in social networks.  A common property of social networks is that cliques form, representing circles of friends or acquaintances in which every member knows every other member <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This inherent tendency to cluster is quantified by the clustering coefficient in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Our two greedy algorithms also capture this property by maximizing the improvement of coverage at each step, and finally tend to select out the most influential nodes in each community (cluster) as the marketing candidates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS</head><p>A typical social network always consists of tens of thousands of individuals, and some very large social networks even could reach several millions of individuals. In this section, we will analyze the complexity of our proposed methods, and introduce some very efficient techniques to reduce the complexity, and to ensure our algorithm is scalable for very large social networks.</p><p>We now consider the three approximation algorithms described in Section 4. Supposing a social network is composed of N individuals and M edges, the complexity for each algorithm is: (1) for Algorithm 1, if the sorting part needs time complexity N log N , the time complexity is O(N (P M + N + N log N )); (2) for Algorithm 2, if the average size of influence set of each individual is d, the time complexity is O(N (P M + M + kdN )); (3) for Algorithm 3, the time complexity is O(kN (P M + N + d)). We could see that in terms of time complexity, which is the same ranking as for the models' reality, reasonableness and accuracy, Algorithm 3 &gt; Algorithm 2 &gt; Algorithm 1. We will show the detailed comparisons in Section 6.</p><p>We can employ some techniques to reduce the computation time. In all three algorithms, for each individual, we execute the heat diffusion process, and calculate the influence set. Actually, it is not necessary to compute this for every individual, since the degrees of social networks fit with power-law distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. A very large number of individuals have very small numbers of neighbors each (outlinks or inlinks). We could assume that selecting these individuals as marketing candidates is not productive. This will greatly decrease the computation time of the algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Complexity of Heat Diffusion Process</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS</head><p>When the graph of a social network is very large, a direct computation of e ¦ÁtH is very time-consuming. We adopt its discrete approximation to compute the heat diffusion equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">f(t) = I + ¦Át P H P f(0),<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where P is a positive integer. In order to reduce the computational complexity, we introduce two techniques: (1) since f(0) is a vector, we iteratively calculate (I + ¦Át P H) P f(0) by applying the operator (I+ ¦Át P H) to f(0); (2) for matrix H, we employ a data structure which only stores the information of non-zero entries, since it is a very sparse matrix. Thus, supposing a social network is connected by M edges (relationships between individuals), the complexity of executing the heat diffusion process is O(P M ), which means the number of iterations P multiplied by the number of edges M in a We conduct several experiments to measure the performance of our proposed models and algorithms, but due to the space limitation here, we present only the experimental results of the three marketing candidates selection algorithms on the directed social network. For the undirected social network and directed social network with prior knowledge of diffusion probabilities, the results and trends are similar to this. The experiments address the following questions: (1) What is the performance of our marketing candidates selection algorithms? (2) How does influence diffuse in the social network? (3) How should sequential marketing actions be planned? and (4) How to defend against diffusion of negative information? In the following, Section 6.2 to 6.5 answer these questions respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Dataset</head><p>A tremendous amount of data has been produced on the Internet every day over the past decade. Millions of people      influence each other implicitly or explicitly through online social network services, such as MySpace, Facebook, Orkut, etc. As a result, there are many online opportunities to mine social networks for the purposes of viral marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>We choose Epinions 2 as the data source for our experiments on social network marketing. Epinions.com is a wellknown knowledge sharing site and review site that was established in 1999. In order to add reviews, users (contributors) need to register for free and begin submitting their own personal opinions on products, companies or movies, etc. These reviews will influence future customers when they are deciding whether a product is worth buying or a movie is worth watching. Every member of Epinions maintains a "trust" list which presents a network of trust relationships between users, and a "block (distrust)" list which presents a network of distrust relationships. This network is called the "web of trust", and is used by Epinions to re-order the product reviews such that a user first sees reviews by users that they trust. Epinions is thus an ideal source for experiments on social networks and viral marketing.</p><p>We construct the graph of the Epinions social network by the following rules: (1) We consider only the "trust" relationship between members of Epinions. (2) If a member v trusts another member w, we create a directed link from node w to node v to interpret the trust relationship between these two members. The intuition behind this consideration is that if v trusts w, then w has a very high probability to influence v by word-of-mouth. Thus, we need to scan the trust list of every member in Epinions to build a social network graph. The dataset we employed is one of the 25 product categories, "Kids &amp; Family", as it had the most reviews per product (10.2 on average) and reviews per person who submitted at least one review in the category (5.8, on average). This social network is composed of 75,888 users from Epinions, and 508,960 edges are created between these users. The indegrees and outdegrees of this social network fits with power-law distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> which has been found in many social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The degree distributions of Epinions social network are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>(a) and 2(b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Experiments on Marketing Candidates Selection</head><p>We describe the simulations on evaluating our three marketing candidates selection algorithms first. As stated above, all the experimental results presented here use the heat diffusion model on a directed social network (Section 3.2). Three parameters need to be specified before starting the candidates selection algorithms. The first parameter is the initial heat vector f(0), and this vector determines how much heat the heat sources need. For the purpose to let heat sources have enough heat to diffuse, we need to allocate a relatively large heat value to heat sources. We choose as the amount of heat for each heat source, where N is the number of consumers in this Epinions dataset, and k is the number of marketing candidates (heat sources). This consideration indicates that the average amount of heat of every consumer is 1. The second parameter is the thermal conductivity value ¦Á, which controls the heat diffusion rate of our model. We set ¦Á = 1 in all of our experiments. The third parameter is the adoption threshold ¦È. If at time t, one consumer's heat value is greater or equal to ¦È, we consider this consumer to adopt this product. Actually, in real life, consumers may have different adoption threshold values, but in this paper, in order to simplify the model, we set ¦È = 0.6.</p><p>We employ the term "coverage", which denotes how many consumers adopt the products, to evaluate our three proposed algorithms. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Figure 3</ref> shows the simulation results at t = 0.10, t = 0.15 and t = 0.20 under the following <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: IDs of Marketing Candidates Selected at t = 0.10, t = 0.15 and t = 0.20 scenario: if we are given 1 to 20 product samples (k = 20), who we should choose as the marketing candidates and what is the performance (measured by the value of coverage) if we choose these candidates. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Figure 3</ref>(a) and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Fig- ure 3(d)</ref> show the simulation results at time t = 0.10. The star, down triangle and diamond in solid line represent the Top-k algorithm, k-step Greedy algorithm and Enhanced kstep Greedy algorithm, respectively. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Figure 3</ref>(a), 3(b) and 3(c), the x-axes denote the number of marketing candidates we are given, and the y-axes present the resulting coverage. We can easily draw the conclusion from these results that the Enhanced k-step Greedy algorithms has the best performance among the three algorithms. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Figure 3(d)</ref>, 3(e) and 3(f) show the increase of coverage of each selection step compared with the previous selection step. Since the Top-k algorithm does not consider the overlap between each influence set, we can observe that its curve fluctuates sharply. This indicates that the Top-k algorithm is a very naive algorithm and it does not performs well in practice. Generally, the curves of k-step Greedy algorithm and Enhanced k-step Greedy algorithm are much smoother than that of the Topk algorithm; also the Enhanced k-step Greedy algorithm causes more consumers to adopt products than the k-step Greedy algorithm.</p><p>We also list the IDs of corresponding consumers who are selected as the marketing candidates by our algorithms in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The ID numbers range from 0 to 75,887 since we have 75,888 users in Epinions social network totally. We observe that the first four selected candidates (IDs are 18, 143, 737 and 790) are the same for all of these algorithms. This phenomenon matches the real life situation that a social network is a network composed of several different communities or clusters, and every community has some very influential persons. These four persons are very likely to be belong to four different communities and fulfil important roles in these communities, like the authoritative entities in a social network which can be identified by the HITS algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Beyond the first four marketing candidates, however, the remaining candidates chosen by each of our three algorithms are different. The above analysis indicates that our proposed framework can best represent the clustering coefficient property of real-world social networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Diffusion of Influence</head><p>In the preceding section, we select 20 marketing candidates out of 75,888 consumers using each of our three selection algorithms. These 20 consumers will be treated as the diffusion sources, and start to influence others through wordof-mouth process. More and more consumers will adopt this product. Due to the large number of consumers, it is impractical to list here all the detailed data on how influence diffuses in this social network. Hence, in this section, we illustrate this process in a simple, clear and visual way.</p><p>First we plot out the Epinions social network graph. Every relationship in this social network is represented by a gray line. At time t = 0, we color the 20 marketing candidates which are selected by Enhanced k-step Greedy algorithm in dark red using RGB value. When the time reaches t = 0.2, as <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>(a) shows, more and more consumers are influenced by their neighbors(consumers colored dark red have higher probabilities to adopt this product than consumers colored light red; the degree of darkness is computed using our heat diffusion models). In <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>(b), when t = 0.5, we observe that more consumers tend to adopt this product than when t = 0.2. This phenomenon coincides with the intuition that the number of adopters will grow rapidly through a word-of-mouth process in real-world.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Sequential Marketing Actions</head><p>So far, our algorithms plan the marketing strategies only once; actually most companies hope to plan a marketing strategy step by step to satisfy the market demand. Suppose we have k samples for marketing a product, and we wish to deliver a quota k0, k1, . . . , kn?1 of samples to preselected candidates at specific time point t0, t1, . . . , tn?1, where k0 + k1 + . . . + kn?1 = k. The problem is how to design the marketing strategy and how to choose the marketing candidates to maximize the adoptions of this product.</p><p>Since our diffusion models have the advantage of being time-dependent, we can easily design marketing strategies (a) t = 0.20 (b) t = 0.50</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 4: Graph Demo on Diffusion of Influence</head><p>at different time points. Suppose at time t0 = 0, we deliver k0 samples to k0 consumers selected by our algorithms, denoted by a set Ct0, and from time t0 to time t1, several other consumers adopt this product, denoted by a set At0?t1. We could observe that a total of {U ? (Ct0 + At0?t1)} consumers have not adopted this product at time t1, where U is the set of all consumers. We then start our next step marketing action by selecting Ct1 candidates from these {U ? (Ct0 + At0?t1)} consumers, and marketing products to them. Thus, at time point t2, At1?t2 consumers are successfully influenced by others. We repeat this process until all the actions are executed. In real life, n is often less than 3.</p><p>We have also conducted several experiments to simulate the sequential marketing actions at different time points; we omit the details here due to space limitations. In general, we observe that the above heuristic algorithm ensures that our marketing strategies cover the greatest number and most diverse possible range of consumers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5">Diffusion of Negative Information</head><p>Social networks are very dynamic and complex networks. All kinds of information flows on social networks; we can simply classify this information as positive and negative. The presence of negative information makes modeling social network marketing extremely difficult; no previous models have considered negative information. Although in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, a propagation model of trust and distrust is proposed, this model tries only to answer the question of why people trust and distrust others, and does not address the question of how positive and negative comments diffuse.</p><p>Previous diffusion models all assume that people will always positively recommend a product to their friends if they adopt it. Actually, in real life, one has a high probability to tell one's friends not to buy a product if he or she feels that this product is not good enough after he or she used it. Unfortunately, no previous work has taken account of this serious problem.</p><p>In this paper, our proposed diffusion models can naturally simulate product adoptions in the presence of both positive and negative comments. At the beginning of the marketing candidates selection algorithms, based on some prior knowledge, if we find a consumer u does not like the product that will be marketed to him(her), this consumer will be allocated a negative value of heat fu(0) by our algorithms. Thus, this consumer will diffuse negative comments to his (her) friends or neighbors in his (her) social network. At time point t, a consumer v in this social network will receive different types of comments from their neighbors. Some are positive and others are negative. Consumer v will decide whether to adopt this product or not depending on the heat diffusion equation f(t) = e ¦ÁtH f(0). If fv(t) ¡Ý ¦È, consumer v will adopt this product, and if fv(t) &lt; ¦È, consumer v will not adopt this product. Another possibility is fv(t) &lt; 0, which means consumer v is persuaded by the negative comments, and will diffuse negative comments to his (her) neighbors too.</p><p>How can the influence of negative comments be minimized? We utilize a heuristic algorithm to try to alleviate the impact of negative comments as much as possible. Before describing this algorithm, we make the following assumptions: (1) Determining whether a consumer likes or dislikes a specific product needs some prior knowledge on this consumer's previous profiles, such as purchase record, reviews and feedback. Due to the lack of such data, we preassign some consumers to diffuse negative comments. (2) In order to simplify the model, we assume that only the first selected marketing candidates could diffuse negative comments, which means, at time t, if a consumer adopts this product, in the remaining time, this consumer will only diffuse positive comments to others.</p><p>Now the heuristic defense algorithm on how to choose marketing candidates to defend against negative information can be described as follows: (1) First select k marketing candidates using the k-step Greedy algorithm or the Enhanced k-step Greedy algorithm, and suppose some of these candidates dislike this product, and will be allocated negative initial heat values. (2) For each candidate who dislikes the product, select an additional ka candidates who have the most common influence sets with this candidate as the complementary diffusion sources. These complementary candidates can alleviate the damage that the negative comments cause, or even eliminate it.</p><p>Suppose we are given 10 product samples to market to consumers, and we select 10 candidates based on the Enhanced k-step Greedy algorithm. If no-one among these candidates diffuses negative comments on this product, the coverage curve or adoption curve is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 5</ref> as the star curve in a solid line. If the first candidate dislikes this product, he(she) will diffuse negative information to his (her) friends. Since the first candidate is the most influential node in this social network, the adoption curve will drop substantially, as shown in the down triangle curve in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 5</ref>. We then execute the defense algorithm described above, and suppose ka = 2, which means we select two defense candidates to alleviate the negative impact as much as possible. From the diamond curve in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 5</ref>, we see that this defense algorithm works well and alleviates the damage Kong Special Administrative Region, China (Project No. CUHK4150/07E and GRF #412507). caused by the negative comments. The reason why the diamond curve will drop a little at the beginning is that the two defense candidates are employed to alleviate the damage from the first candidate; however, eventually, they will increase the number of product adoptions. Since the social network is really a very complicated network, we have illustrated only a simple example of how to defend against negative information in this paper. A more detailed and extensive analysis of diffusion of negative information will be included in the future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we propose a social network marketing framework which includes three diffusion models and three marketing candidates selection algorithms. The purpose of our work is to model social network marketing as realistically as possible. Our proposed methods have several advantages compared with previous work, including how to defend against diffusion of negative information, which has not been explored previously. The complexity analysis shows our framework is scalable for very large social networks, and an empirical study using the Epinions dataset confirms the promise of our proposed framework.</p><p>Although we have developed some models and algorithms for social network marketing, several remaining issues need to be studied in the future. We coin the concept of "negative information diffusion" in this paper, and introduce how to defend against this kind of information by employing a simple heuristic algorithm. The understanding of how negative information is diffused is still at a crude level, and more theoretical analysis will be conducted in the future.</p><p>As we mentioned in this paper, a social network is a very complicated network, and that is why we always try to model social network marketing as accurately as possible within a simple model. An important property of any social network is evolution. Every social network is evolving all the time. So far, our work considers social network as a static network only, and ignores newcomers, new relationships between existing members and the growth of the network's size. In the future, we plan to consider the evolution property of social networks, and permit our social network to grow at a certain rate. The power-law distribution property of social networks and some link prediction algorithms may be helpful in modeling dynamic social networks.</p></div>
