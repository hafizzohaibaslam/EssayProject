				<p>Keywords Usually a customer make the decision to buy a product if she/he is cumulatively impacted by enough pieces of information for the product. In this paper we use the classical independent cascade model in social network to model the information diffusion. In this model, the active probability of a node can be regarded as the frequency of a customer receiving information after multiple information diffusion. In this work we study a new type of activation named cumulative activation. A node is cumulatively active if its active probability is beyond a given threshold. Two optimization problems are investigated under this framework: seed minimization with cumulative activation (SM-CA) problem, which asks how to select a seed set with minimum size such that the number of cumulatively active nodes can reach a given threshold; influence maximization with cumulative activation (IM-CA) problem, which asks how to choose a seed set with a fixed budget to maximize the number of cumulatively active nodes. We first show the nonsubmodularity of the function representing the number of cumulatively active nodes, which means unlike many previously studied problems in social network, our problems cannot be solved directly via submodular function optimization. For SM-CA problem, we design a greedy algorithm which yields a bi-criteria O(ln n)-approximation when ¦Ç = n, here ¦Ç is the given threshold and n is the number of nodes in the network. For ¦Ç &lt; n, we show an ?(n ¦Ä)-inapproximate result under a wildly believed hardness assumption of the densest k-subgraph problem. For IM-CA problem, we prove that it is NP-hard to approximate the problem within n 1?¦Å for any ¦Å &gt; 0. What&apos;s more, we provide two efficient heuristic algorithms for SM-CA and IM-CA respectively. Experiments results on different real-world social networks show that our heuristic algorithms outperform many previous algorithms. social networks; independent cascade model; cumulative activation ; influence maximization; seed minimization</p>

In recent years, with the rapid increasing popularity of Facebook, Google and Twitter etc., social networks have become powerful media for spreading information, ideas and products among individuals. Specially, marketing for products through social networks can attract large amount of customers.</p><p>Motivated by this background, influence in social networks has been extensively studied. However, most of previous works only consider the influence after one time spreading. In contrast, in the real world, people typically make decisions after they have cumulated many pieces of information concerning an item, whether it is a new technology, new product, etc. Consider the following scenario: A company is going to launch a new version (named as V7 for convenient) of their product, but most people are not familiar with the performance of this new product. Thus, it is better for the company to show multiple versions of advertisements for different features of V7. To marketing in a social network, one frequently used and highly effective way is to choose a few influential people in the network and pay them such that they can broadcast advertisements of V7. We call those influential people "seeds".</p><p>Standing on the perspective of potential customers, the first time they receive the information of V7 from their friends, they may forward this information, but this may not necessarily lead to their purchase action. Users may repeatedly receive and forward new information about V7, until they have cumulated enough pieces of information about the new product, at which time the purchase action is triggered. We model this by assuming that there is a threshold for each customer, who will buy V7 if the amount of information and recommendation that he receives exceeding his threshold. We measure the amount of information a user received as the fraction of information cascades that reaches the user, which is simply the activation probability of the user in an information cascade model. Therefore, we have an information cascade model to specify how information or influence propagates in the social network, and the model determines the probability of user receiving information (given a fixed seed set), which is interpreted as the fraction of information received by the user, and the user is finally activated if the fraction of information it receives exceeds his own threshold.</p><p>Our diffusion process following the widely used independent cascade model presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>: A social network is defined on a directed graph with nodes representing individuals and edges representing relationships between individuals. Each edge is related to an activation probability. Initially, a set of nodes is selected as seeds and become active, all other nodes are inactive. At each step, active nodes have one chance to activate each of its inactive out-neighbor and if successful (with probability on edges) then the neighbor become active. In this diffusion model, each node has a probability to be active. We say a node is cumulatively active if this probability exceeds its threshold. This probability can be regarded as the amount of recommendation the node receives after a large number of diffusion processes.</p><p>Given the above cumulative activation model, the company may be facing one of the following two objectives: either the company may have a fixed budget to activate the seed nodes, and want to maximize the number of cumulative activations, or the company may need to reach a predetermined number of cumulative activations, and want to minimize the number of seeds.</p><p>We formulate the above scenarios as the following two optimization problems: Seed minimization with cumulative activation (SM-CA) problem and influence maximization with cumulative activation (IM-CA) problem. Given a directed graph with a probability on each edge and a threshold for each node, a requirement ¦Ç and a budget k, the SM-CA problem is to find a seed set with minimum size such that the number of cumulatively active nodes is at least ¦Ç. The IM-CA problem is to find a seed set with k nodes such that the number of cumulatively active nodes is maximum.</p><p>In this paper, we first show the nonsubmodularity of the function corresponding to the number of cumulatively active nodes under a seed set for SM-CA problem and IM-CA problem, which means we can not use greedy algorithm directly to guarantee the approximation ratio.</p><p>For SM-CA problem, we consider the case ¦Ç = n and ¦Ç &lt; n separately, where n is the number of nodes in the network. The complexity results on these two cases are quite different. When ¦Ç = n, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate within (1 ? ¦Å) ln n for any ¦Å &gt; 0. Then we construct a contribution function f (S) which can guarantee the equivalency to all feasible solutions of SM-CA problem. We prove that exactly computing f (S) is #P-hard but f (S) can be estimated with enough precision by Monte Carlo simulation. We also show the submodularity of f (S) and then design a greedy algorithm yielding a bicriteria O(ln n)-approximation.</p><p>When ¦Ç &lt; n, we construct a reduction from the dense k-subgraph problem to SM-CA problem and show that SM-CA problem can not be approximated within Finally, we conduct experiments on two real-world social networks to test the performance of our heuristic algorithms.</p><p>To summarize, our contributions include: (a) we propose the seed minimization and influence maximization problem under cumulative activation (SM-CA problem and IM-CA problem respectively), which is a reasonable model for purchasing behavior of customers; (b)we design a greedy algorithm for SM-CA problem when ¦Ç = n with tight performance ratio; (c) we show strong hardness results for SM-CA problem when ¦Ç &lt; n and IM-CA problem; (d) we design two heuristic algorithms for SM-CA problem and two heuristic algorithms for IM-CA problem and empirically demonstrate the performance ratio for our heuristic algorithms using realworld datasets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MODEL AND PROBLEM DEFINITIONS</head><p>Our social network is defined on a directed graph G = (V, E), where V is the set of nodes representing individuals and E is the set of directed edges representing social ties between pairs of individuals. Each edge e = (u, v) ¡Ê E is associated with a probability puv, which represents the probability that u activates v. Our influence process follows the independent cascade (IC) model proposed by <ref type="bibr">Kempe et al. [17]</ref>. In the IC model, discrete time steps t = 0, 1, 2, ¡¤ ¡¤ ¡¤ are used to model the diffusion process. Each node in G has two states: inactive or active, all nodes are inactive at step 0. At step 1, a subset S ? V is selected as seed set and nodes in the seed set are activated directly. For any step t ¡Ý 1, if a node u is newly activated at step t ? 1, then u has a single chance to activate each of its inactive out-neighbor v with independent probability puv. Once a node becomes active, it will never return to the inactive state. The diffusion process stops when there is no new activation at a time step.</p><p>We consider a new type of activation as follows: For each node u ¡Ê V , let Pu(S) be the probability that u becomes active after the diffusion process starting from the seed set S. Specially, we suppose Pu(S) = 1 for u ¡Ê S. If there are many times of diffusion processes, we can regard Pu(S) as the frequency that u accepts information successfully after these processes. Suppose that each node has an accepted threshold ¦Óu and a node is called cumulatively active if Pu(S) ¡Ý ¦Óu. We call this type of activation as Cumulative Activation (CA). Given a target set U ? V and a seed set S, let ¦ÑU (S) be the number of cumulatively active nodes in U under S. When the context is clear, we omit the subscript U and use ¦Ñ(S) directly.</p><p>We consider two optimization problems under cumulative activation, seed minimization with cumulative activation (SM-CA) problem and influence maximization with cumulative activation (IM-CA) problem. SM-CA problem aims at finding a seed set S with minimum size such that there are at least ¦Ç (¦Ç ¡Ü n) nodes that are cumulatively activated in the target set. IM-CA problem is the problem that finding a seed set of size k to maximize the number of nodes cumulatively activated in the target set. The formal definitions are as follows. node u and a size budget k ¡Ü n. Our goal is to find a seed set S * ? V of size k such that the number of cumulatively active nodes in U is maximized, that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S * = arg max ¦ÑU (S).</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S:|S|=k</head><p>Notice that, it makes no difference if we set the target set to be the set of all nodes in our paper. Thus, the target set is regarded as V if there is no special statement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1}.</head><p>The example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows that ¦Ñ(S) is not submodular in general: Here G is a bipartite graph and the probability on each edge is 1/2, the target set U = {u} and ¦Óu = 7/8. Let S = {a} and T = {a, b}, we have ¦Ñ(S ¡È {c}) ? ¦Ñ(S) = 0 and ¦Ñ(T ¡È {c}) ? ¦Ñ(T ) = 1. Thus, ¦Ñ(S) is not submodular.</p><p>In the rest part of this section, we consider how to design efficient algorithms for SM-CA problem and IM-CA problem as well as the hardness of them.

Our key observation is that when ¦Ç = n, we can replace the nonsubmodular function ¦Ñ(S) to a submodular function f (S), such that the feasible solution for SM-CA problem can also be characterized by f (S) instead of ¦Ñ(S). The contribution function f (S) is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">| ? f (S) ? f (S)| = min{?Pumin{? min{?Pu(S), ¦Óu} ? min{Pu(S), ¦Óu} u¡ÊV u¡ÊV ¡Ü | ? Pu(S) ? Pu(S)| + | ?

But as most work in IC model, we can not avoid the problem of computing f (S). It has been proved that computing ¦Ò(S) is #P-hard <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, where ¦Ò(S) is the expected value of the number of active nodes influenced by a seed set S. Thus, computing f (S) is also #P-hard since ¦Ò(S) = u¡ÊV Pu(S) = f (S) if we set ¦Óu = 1 for all u ¡Ê V .</p><p>In this section, we use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate f (S) (see Algorithm 1).

So here we assume that all seeds selected by algorithm A are from V1. Since for each edge (v, e) ¡Ê E , pve = 1/2 and for each node e ¡Ê V2, ¦Óe = 3/4, an easy probability calculation implies that a node e ¡Ê V2 can be cumulatively activated if and only if both endpoints of e are selected as seeds.</p><p>Suppose the seed set of SM-CA-I with parameter ¦Ç = ¦Ç(k) computed by algorithm A is S , then we can use the corresponding node set S in graph G as an approximate solution of the DkS problem.

The question is whether there exists k subsets whose union is W .</p><p>Given an instance of the set cover problem, we construct an instance of IM-CA problem as follows: There are three types of nodes, set nodes, element nodes, and dummy nodes. There is a set node u corresponding to each set, an element node v corresponding to each element, and a directed edge (u, v) with activation probability puv = 1 if the element represented by v is belong to the set represented by u and puv = 0 otherwise.

In total, there will be n c + n + k nodes become cumulatively active. On the other hand, let's consider the case if there is no set cover of size k. Again we can assume all the seeds are selected from set nodes, since as a candidate for seeds, set nodes are more efficient than element nodes and dummy nodes. Thus, if there is no set cover of size k, then we can not find k seeds which activate all the element nodes, hence none of the dummy notes are activated. Therefore, the total number of nodes cumulatively activated are no more than n + k.

Having these selection schemes, we now present the whole greedy algorithm for SM-CA problem in Algorithm 5. This algorithm selects nodes by SelectByF. The greedy algorithm selecting nodes by SelectBy¦ÑF is named as GCAF-SM, we omit the detail of this algorithm since all operations in GCAF-SM are same with GF-SM except the process of selecting nodes. We compare the performance of GCAF-SM in the experiment section.</p><p>In GF-SM, we first initialize for the algorithm, then generate ¦È RR sets for each node in V . For each node u, u is cumulatively active only if there are at least ¦È¦Óu (i.e. the initial requirement for u) RR sets for u hit by seed set since we can estimate Pu(S) by FR u (S) based on lemma 4. At each step, we add a new node x into the current seed set by SelectByF. After a seed x be selected, we need to remove all RR sets containing x and update the requirement for each node. This is because x contributes to all uncumulatively active nodes whose RR sets containing x and the requirements of these nodes can be partial satisfied by x. The algorithm ends until the number of cumulative active nodes is at least ¦Ç.</p><p>Now we analyze the time complexity of Algorithm 5. Let EP T be the expectation of in-degree in G of all nodes in a RR set, that is to say, the expected time of generating a RR set is EP T . Thus, the total expected time of the generation is O(n¦È ¡¤ EP T ). By Lemma 4, ¦È = O(log n) is enough for accuracy. Thus, the expected generation time is O(n log n¡¤EP T ). Besides the generation time, the main time cost depends on SelectByF since other operations only take time O(n). Let EP T V be the expected number of nodes in a RR set, since EP T V ¡Ü EP T , SelectByF takes time O(n ¡¤ EP T ) in expectation. The sorting time in SelectByF is O(n log n). Thus, the expected total time cost of GF-SM is O(n¦Ç(log n + EP T )). Indeed, EP T is constant in realworld datasets, thus the real total time cost is O(n¦Ç log n).</p><p>The time complexity of GCAF-SM is the same with GF-SM since the time cost of SelectBy¦ÑF is also O(n(log n + EP T )).</p><p>For IM-CA problem, we use the same selection scheme with SM-CA problem.

One interesting point is that TIM + , GF-IM perform similarly when ¦Ó = 0.9. This is because when ¦Ó is large enough, f (S) is close to u¡ÊV Pu(S), which is the contribution function of classical activating scheme. In this case, GF-IM can not distinguish cumulative activation from classical activation proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. However, when ¦Ó is small, GF-IM slightly outperforms TIM + . Then we move to the results of IM-CA on graph NetPHY (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4)</ref>. It can be inferred that GCAF-IM outperforms all other algorithms when ¦Ó is no less than 0.3. When ¦Ó = 0.9, GCAF-IM can cumulatively active about 2500 nodes with 1000 seeds, but the seeds found by other algorithms only achieve no more than 1500 cumulatively active nodes, whose size is very close to the size of original seeds. Comparing the figures of Flixster and NetPHY, the performance gap between GCAF-IM and other algorithms is larger in NetPHY network than Flixster network. We think it is probably because NetPHY are denser than Flixster and cumulative activation is harder in denser graph.</p><p>Algorithms performance of SM-CA problem. For seed minimization problem, algorithms Random, Highdegree and PageRank will output a very large seed set and more important, is quite ineffective since they need many rounds of running as well as time-consuming simulation to estimate current influence size. Thus, in this section, we just compare the performance of TIM + , GF-SM and GCAF-SM. We set ¦È = 500 in SM-CA problem.</p><p>(c) NetPHY with ¦Ó = 0.5 <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: SM-CA results on NetPHY <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows the performance of three algorithms on SM-CA problem on NetPHY. Both GF-SM and GCAF-SM outperform TIM + significantly. For large ¦Ó = 0.5, GF-SM even outperforms GCAF-SM. This is consistent with the Theorem 3: greedily selecting nodes according to the marginal increment to f (¡¤) is better when ¦Ç is close to n for SM-CA.</p><p>Algorithms performance with different ¦Ó . We also study the relationship of algorithm performance and parameter ¦Ó individually. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> reflects the change of cumulative activation influence size with the increase of parameter ¦Ó . From these figures, we observe that GCAF-SM is the best algorithm for all settings of ¦Ó and seed size k. With the increase of ¦Ó , in all algorithms, the sizes of the cumulatively active nodes decrease rapidly. TIM + and GF-SM behave similarly, since both of them somehow follow the greedy scheme of classical activation model. Note that, (a) NetPHY with k = 500 (b) NetPHY with k = 1000</p><p>Figure 6: IM-CA results of ¦Ó on NetPHY GCAF-SM directly promotes size of cumulatively active nodes ¦Ñ(S) each round, and it only further compares f (S) when two nodes contributes equally with the contribution function ¦Ñ(¡¤). So the experiment results show that directly optimize ¦Ñ(¡¤) is the best choice, although ¦Ñ(¡¤) is not submodular.</p><p>Conclusion of experiment. From these experiment results we can see the performance of GCAF-IM and GCAF-SM are better than other algorithms for IM-CA problem and SM-CA problem respectively on both datasets.</p><p>In IM-CA, given ¦Ó , the average number of cumulatively active nodes generated by algorithm A on different parameter k is denoted by C¦Ó (A). We conduct the comparison results between GCAF-IM and other algorithms in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Each percentage in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> is computed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">C¦Ó (GCAF ?IM )?C¦Ó (A)</formula><p>C¦Ó (A)</p><p>.</p><p>Similar to <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, we show comparison results between GCAF-SM and other algorithms in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">FUTURE WORK</head><p>One possible direction of future work is to prove the inapproximability of SM-CA problem with ¦Ç &lt; n unconditionally, or under a weak hardness assumption. On the other side, it will be interested if one can design an approximate algorithm for SM-CA problem with performance ratio O(n 1/8?2¦Å ) on bipartite graph and with ¦Ç &lt; n, since this will imply an O(n 1/4?¦Å )-approximate algorithm for the dense k-subgraph.</p><p>Another direction is to design a more efficient algorithm for IM-CA problem which can guarantee a good performance on real-world networks.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>c</head><label></label><figDesc>2016 ACM.
