				<p>tages. The word order is lost, and thus different sentences can have exactly the same representation, as long as the same words are used. Even though bag-of-n-grams considers the word order in short context, it suffers from data sparsity and high dimensionality. Bag-of-words and bag-of-n-grams have very little sense about the semantics of the words or more formally the distances between the words. This means that words &quot;powerful,&quot; &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;Paris&quot; are equally distant despite the fact that semantically, &quot;power-ful&quot; should be closer to &quot;strong&quot; than &quot;Paris.&quot;</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Text classification and clustering play an important role in many applications, e.g, document retrieval, web search, spam filtering. At the heart of these applications is machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression or Kmeans. These algorithms typically require the text input to be represented as a fixed-length vector. Perhaps the most common fixed-length vector representation for texts is the bag-of-words or bag-of-n-grams <ref type="bibr">(Harris, 1954)</ref> due to its simplicity, efficiency and often surprising accuracy.</p><p>In our model, the vector representation is trained to be useful for predicting words in a paragraph. More precisely, we concatenate the paragraph vector with several word vectors from a paragraph and predict the following word in the given context. Both word vectors and paragraph vectors are trained by the stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Rumelhart et al., 1986)</ref>. While paragraph vectors are unique among paragraphs, the word vectors are shared. At prediction time, the paragraph vectors are inferred by fixing the word vectors and training the new paragraph vector until convergence.</p><p>However, the bag-of-words (BOW) has many disadvan- Our technique is inspired by the recent work in learning vector representations of words using neural networks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bengio et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Collobert &amp; Weston, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mnih &amp; Hinton, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Turian et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Mikolov et al., 2013a</ref>;c). In their formulation, each word is represented by a vector which is concatenated or averaged with other word vectors in a context, and the resulting vector is used to predict other words in the context. For example, the neural network language model proposed in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bengio et al., 2006</ref>) uses the concatenation of several previous word vectors to form the input of a neural network, and tries to predict the next word. The outcome is that after the model is trained, the word vectors are mapped into a vector space such that semantically similar words have similar vector representations (e.g., "strong" is close to "powerful").</p><p>Following these successful techniques, researchers have tried to extend the models to go beyond word level to achieve phrase-level or sentence-level representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Mitchell &amp; Lapata, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Zanzotto et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yessenalina &amp; Cardie, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grefenstette et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mikolov et al., 2013c</ref>). For instance, a simple approach is using a weighted average of all the words in the document. A more sophisticated approach is combining the word vectors in an order given by a parse tree of a sentence, using matrix-vector operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Socher et al., 2011b</ref>). Both approaches have weaknesses. The first approach, weighted averaging of word vectors, loses the word order in the same way as the standard bag-of-words models do. The second approach, using a parse tree to combine word vectors, has been shown to work for only sentences because it relies on parsing. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.

Unlike some of the previous approaches, it is general and applicable to texts of any length: sentences, paragraphs, and documents. It does not require task-specific tuning of the word weighting function nor does it rely on the parse trees. Further in the paper, we will present experiments on several benchmark datasets that demonstrate the advantages of Paragraph Vector. For example, on sentiment analysis task, we achieve new stateof-the-art results, better than complex methods, yielding a relative improvement of more than 16% in terms of error rate. On a text classification task, our method convincingly beats bag-of-words models, giving a relative improvement of about 30%.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">1 T log p(w t |w t?k , ..., w t+k ) t=k</formula><p>The prediction task is typically done via a multiclass classifier, such as softmax.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Algorithms</head><p>We start by discussing previous methods for learning word vectors. These methods are the inspiration for our Paragraph Vector methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Learning Vector Representation of Words</head><p>This section introduces the concept of distributed vector representation of words. A well known framework for learning the word vectors is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The task is to predict a word given the other words in a context.</p><p>In practice, hierarchical softmax <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Morin &amp; Bengio, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mnih &amp; Hinton, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mikolov et al., 2013c</ref>) is preferred to softmax for fast training. In our work, the structure of the hierarical softmax is a binary Huffman tree, where short codes are assigned to frequent words. This is a good speedup trick because common words are accessed quickly. This use of binary Huffman code for the hierarchy is the same with ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mikolov et al., 2013c</ref>).</p><p>In this framework, every word is mapped to a unique vector, represented by a column in a matrix W . The column is indexed by position of the word in the vocabulary. The concatenation or sum of the vectors is then used as features for prediction of the next word in a sentence.</p><p>The neural network based word vectors are usually trained using stochastic gradient descent where the gradient is obtained via backpropagation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Rumelhart et al., 1986)</ref>. This type of models is commonly known as neural language models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bengio et al., 2006</ref>). A particular implementation of neural network based algorithm for training the word vectors is available at code.google.com/p/word2vec/ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Mikolov et al., 2013a</ref>).</p><p>More formally, given a sequence of training words w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , ..., w T , the objective of the word vector model After the training converges, words with similar meaning are mapped to a similar position in the vector space. For example, "powerful" and "strong" are close to each other, whereas "powerful" and "Paris" are more distant. The difference between word vectors also carry meaning. For example, the word vectors can be used to answer analogy questions using simple vector algebra: "King" -"man" + "woman" = "Queen" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Mikolov et al., 2013d)</ref>. It is also possible to learn a linear matrix to translate words and phrases between languages ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Mikolov et al., 2013b</ref>). stochastic gradient descent and the gradient is obtained via backpropagation. At every step of stochastic gradient descent, one can sample a fixed-length context from a random paragraph, compute the error gradient from the network in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> and use the gradient to update the parameters in our model. These properties make word vectors attractive for many natural language processing tasks such as language modeling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bengio et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Mikolov, 2012)</ref>, natural language understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Collobert &amp; Weston, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Zhila et al., 2013</ref> At prediction time, one needs to perform an inference step to compute the paragraph vector for a new paragraph. This is also obtained by gradient descent. In this step, the parameters for the rest of the model, the word vectors W and the softmax weights, are fixed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Paragraph Vector: A distributed memory model</head><p>Our approach for learning paragraph vectors is inspired by the methods for learning the word vectors. The inspiration is that the word vectors are asked to contribute to a prediction task about the next word in the sentence. So despite the fact that the word vectors are initialized randomly, they can eventually capture semantics as an indirect result of the prediction task. We will use this idea in our paragraph vectors in a similar manner. The paragraph vectors are also asked to contribute to the prediction task of the next word given many contexts sampled from the paragraph.</p><p>Suppose that there are N paragraphs in the corpus, M words in the vocabulary, and we want to learn paragraph vectors such that each paragraph is mapped to p dimensions and each word is mapped to q dimensions, then the model has the total of N ¡Á p + M ¡Á q parameters (excluding the softmax parameters). Even though the number of parameters can be large when N is large, the updates during training are typically sparse and thus efficient.</p><p>In our Paragraph Vector framework (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>), every paragraph is mapped to a unique vector, represented by a column in matrix D and every word is also mapped to a unique vector, represented by a column in matrix W . The paragraph vector and word vectors are averaged or concatenated to predict the next word in a context. In the experiments, we use concatenation as the method to combine the vectors.</p><p>More formally, the only change in this model compared to the word vector framework is in equation 1, where h is constructed from W and D. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. A framework for learning paragraph vector. This framework is similar to the framework presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>; the only change is the additional paragraph token that is mapped to a vector via matrix D. In this model, the concatenation or average of this vector with a context of three words is used to predict the fourth word. The paragraph vector represents the missing information from the current context and can act as a memory of the topic of the paragraph.</p><p>The paragraph token can be thought of as another word. It acts as a memory that remembers what is missing from the current context -or the topic of the paragraph. For this reason, we often call this model the Distributed Memory Model of Paragraph Vectors (PV-DM).</p><p>After being trained, the paragraph vectors can be used as features for the paragraph (e.g., in lieu of or in addition to bag-of-words). We can feed these features directly to conventional machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, support vector machines or K-means.</p><p>The contexts are fixed-length and sampled from a sliding window over the paragraph. The paragraph vector is shared across all contexts generated from the same paragraph but not across paragraphs. The word vector matrix W , however, is shared across paragraphs. I.e., the vector for "powerful" is the same for all paragraphs.</p><p>The paragraph vectors and word vectors are trained using In summary, the algorithm itself has two key stages: 1) training to get word vectors W , softmax weights U, b and paragraph vectors D on already seen paragraphs; and 2) "the inference stage" to get paragraph vectors D for new paragraphs (never seen before) by adding more columns in D and gradient descending on D while holding W, U, b fixed. We use D to make a prediction about some particular labels using a standard classifier, e.g., logistic regression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advantages of paragraph vectors:</head><p>An important advantage of paragraph vectors is that they are learned from unlabeled data and thus can work well for tasks that do not have enough labeled data. Skip-gram model in word vectors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mikolov et al., 2013c</ref>).</p><p>Paragraph vectors also address some of the key weaknesses of bag-of-words models. First, they inherit an important property of the word vectors: the semantics of the words. In this space, "powerful" is closer to "strong" than to "Paris." The second advantage of the paragraph vectors is that they take into consideration the word order, at least in a small context, in the same way that an n-gram model with a large n would do. This is important, because the n-gram model preserves a lot of information of the paragraph, including the word order. That said, our model is perhaps better than a bag-of-n-grams model because a bag of n-grams model would create a very high-dimensional representation that tends to generalize poorly.</p><p>In our experiments, each paragraph vector is a combination of two vectors: one learned by the standard paragraph vector with distributed memory (PV-DM) and one learned by the paragraph vector with distributed bag of words (PV-DBOW). PV-DM alone usually works well for most tasks (with state-of-art performances), but its combination with PV-DBOW is usually more consistent across many tasks that we try and therefore strongly recommended.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experiments</head><p>We perform experiments to better understand the behavior of the paragraph vectors. To achieve this, we benchmark Paragraph Vector on two text understanding problems that require fixed-length vector representations of paragraphs: sentiment analysis and information retrieval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Paragraph Vector without word ordering: Distributed bag of words</head><p>The above method considers the concatenation of the paragraph vector with the word vectors to predict the next word in a text window. Another way is to ignore the context words in the input, but force the model to predict words randomly sampled from the paragraph in the output. In reality, what this means is that at each iteration of stochastic gradient descent, we sample a text window, then sample a random word from the text window and form a classification task given the Paragraph Vector. This technique is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>. We also test our method on an information retrieval task, where the goal is to decide if a document should be retrieved given a query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Sentiment Analysis with the Stanford Sentiment Treebank Dataset</head><p>Dataset: This dataset was first proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Pang &amp; Lee, 2005)</ref> and subsequently extended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Socher et al., 2013b</ref>) as a benchmark for sentiment analysis.

The labels are generated by human annotators using Amazon Mechanical Turk. In this version, the paragraph vector is trained to predict the words in a small window.</p><p>In addition to being conceptually simple, this model requires to store less data. We only need to store the softmax weights as opposed to both softmax weights and word vectors in the previous model. This model is also similar to the  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Socher et al., 2013b)</ref>, the authors propose two ways of benchmarking. First, one could consider a 5-way fine-grained classification task where the labels are {Very Negative, Negative, Neutral, Positive, Very Positive} or a 2-way coarse-grained classification task where the labels are {Negative, Positive}. The other axis of variation is in terms of whether we should label the entire sentence or all phrases in the sentence. In this work we only consider labeling the full sentences. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The performance of our method compared to other approaches on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Beyond One Sentence: Sentiment Analysis with IMDB dataset</head><p>In our experiments, we cross validate the window size using the validation set, and the optimal window size is 8. The vector presented to the classifier is a concatenation of two vectors, one from PV-DBOW and one from PV-DM. In PV-DBOW, the learned vector representations have 400 dimensions. In PV-DM, the learned vector representations have 400 dimensions for both words and paragraphs. To predict the 8-th word, we concatenate the paragraph vectors and 7 word vectors.

For instance, Recursive Neural Tensor Network ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Socher et al., 2013b</ref>) is based on the parsing over each sentence and it is unclear how to combine the representations over many sentences. Such techniques therefore are restricted to work on sentences but not paragraphs or documents.</p><p>Results: We report the error rates of different methods in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The first highlight for this <ref type="table">Table is</ref> that bag-ofwords or bag-of-n-grams models (NB, SVM, BiNB) perform poorly. Simply averaging the word vectors (in a bagof-words fashion) does not improve the results. This is because bag-of-words models do not consider how each sentence is composed (e.g., word ordering) and therefore fail to recognize many sophisticated linguistic phenomena, for instance sarcasm. The results also show that Our method does not require parsing, thus it can produce a representation for a long document consisting of many sentences. This advantage makes our method more general than some of the other approaches. The following experiment on IMDB dataset demonstrates this advantage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dataset:</head><p>The IMDB dataset was first proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Maas et al.

One key aspect of this dataset is that each movie review has several sentences.</p><p>The 100,000 movie reviews are divided into three datasets:</p><p>25,000 labeled training instances, 25,000 labeled test instances and 50,000 unlabeled training instances. There are two types of labels: Positive and Negative. These labels are balanced in both the training and the test set. The dataset can be downloaded at http://ai.Stanford.edu/ amaas/data/sentiment/index.html It achieves 7.42% which is another 1.3% absolute improvement (or 15% relative improvement) over the best previous result of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Wang &amp; Manning, 2012)</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. The performance of Paragraph Vector compared to other approaches on the IMDB dataset.

The paragraph vectors for the 25,000 labeled instances are then fed through a neural network with one hidden layer with 50 units and a logistic classifier to learn to predict the sentiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1</head><p>At test time, given a test sentence, we again freeze the rest of the network and learn the paragraph vectors for the test reviews by gradient descent. Once the vectors are learned, we feed them through the neural network to predict the sentiment of the reviews.</p><p>The hyperparameters of our paragraph vector model are selected in the same manner as in the previous task. In particular, we cross validate the window size, and the optimal window size is 10 words. The vector presented to the classifier is a concatenation of two vectors, one from PV-DBOW and one from PV-DM. In PV-DBOW, the learned vector representations have 400 dimensions. In PV-DM, the learned vector representations have 400 dimensions for both words and documents. To predict the 10-th word, we concatenate the paragraph vectors and word vectors.

Paragraph 3: allina health clinic patients for your convenience , you can pay your allina health clinic bill online . pay your clinic bill now , question and answers...</p><p>? PV-DM is consistently better than PV-DBOW. PV-DM alone can achieve results close to many results in this paper (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). For example, in IMDB, PV-DM only achieves 7.63%. The combination of PV-DM and PV-DBOW often work consistently better (7.42% in IMDB) and therefore recommended.</p><p>The triplets are split into three sets: 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. Any method that requires learning will be trained on the training set, while its hyperparameters will be selected on the validation set.</p><p>We benchmark four methods to compute features for paragraphs: bag-of-words, bag-of-bigrams, averaging word vectors and Paragraph Vector. To improve bag-of-bigrams, we also learn a weighting matrix such that the distance between the first two paragraphs is minimized whereas the distance between the first and the third paragraph is maximized (the weighting factor between the two losses is a hyperparameter).</p><p>? Using concatenation in PV-DM is often better than sum. In IMDB, PV-DM with sum can only achieve 8.06%. Perhaps, this is because the model loses the ordering information.</p><p>? It's better to cross validate the window size. A good guess of window size in many applications is between 5 and 12. In IMDB, varying the window sizes between 5 and 12 causes the error rate to fluctuate 0.7%.</p><p>We record the number of times when each method produces smaller distance for the first two paragraphs than the first and the third paragraph. An error is made if a method does not produce that desirable distance metric on a triplet of paragraphs.</p><p>? Paragraph Vector can be expensive, but it can be done in parallel at test time. On average, our implementation takes 30 minutes to compute the paragraph vectors of the IMDB test set, using a 16 core machine (25,000 documents, each document on average has 230 words).</p></div>

to this dataset and find that their Recursive Neural Tensor 
Network works much better than bag-of-words model. It 
can be argued that this is because movie reviews are often 
short and compositionality plays an important role in de-
ciding whether the review is positive or negative, as well as 
similarity between words does given the rather tiny size of 
the training set.
