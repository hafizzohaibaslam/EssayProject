			<abstract>
				<p>A new model is proposed to understand the structuring of social networks in a xed setting such as for example inside a university. The friendship formation is based on the frequency of encounters and mutual interest. The model shows distinctive single scale behavior and reproduces accurately the measurable experimental quantities like clustering coecients, degree distribution, degree correlation and friendship distribution. The model produces self-organized community structures and can be described as a network of densely interconnected networks. For the friendships we nd that the mutual interest is the dominant factor, which optimizes the network and that the number of encounters determines the statistically relevant distributions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>In statistical physics complex networks have recently attracted a considerable interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">2]</ref>. Barab¨¢si and Albert <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[3]</ref> have introduced a prototypical growing network model (BA-model), which exhibits scale free properties for the degree distribution P (k) ? k ?3 . The main ingredients for this model are growth and preferential attachment, which seem to be able to explain and describe various observations in social science. Preferential attachment corresponds to the Mathew eect that the rich get richer. However friendship is fundamentally dierent from the behavior of other social networks in that they are single scale networks and show a small world eect <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4]</ref>. It has been observed that preferential attachment is sucient to establish a power law behavior in the growing model, however for non-growing networks with a constant number of nodes the degree distribution is unstable and converges to a Gaussian distribution upon saturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. It was shown however that also in a xedsetting network scale free behavior can be found <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">6]</ref>. In these models random weights were introduced. Gonz¨¢lez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref> have presented a model based on a system of moving particles, which by colliding form links between each other. While this model was able to recover degree distribution, clustering coecients and other quantities for a large database of empirical friendship networks it has also two drawbacks: i) it is not apparent why the simulations are carried out in a 2D space and ii) a collision in this system automatically leads to a friendship, which is generally not the case with a random encounter.</p><p>In this paper we present a new model for a friendship network, which reproduces known quantities of empirical networks such as degree distribution, clustering coecients and friendship distributions. Similar to Ref.</p><p>[7] the community structure emerges naturally, without the need of pre-labeling the community for each agent as in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[8]</ref>. Our model denes N a agents with no initial connections. This setting is comparable to a large group of students enrolling at the same time in college or high school. At every step two agents are chosen to form an acquaintance. In the beginning the encounters are random, however in time, due to preferential selection, eventually some agents form connections -friendships -which are based on two criteria: i) the number of contacts with the same individual and ii) mutual interest. We have assumed here that friendship is reciprocal. Extension of the model to unidirectional (proting) connections will be discussed elsewhere. In time, the number of contacts with dierent agents increases up to a largest number, which is an individual property of the agent. Further contacts are then only possible by forgetting previous contacts. This is similar to the concept of aging in Amaral et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4]</ref>. Despite of the similarity there is however an important dierence: in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4]</ref> the agents were aging until they died. In contrast, here the agent will accept new connections throughout the simulation, however at the expense of dropping old ones as will be shown below in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. MODEL DESCRIPTION</head><p>Each agent i possesses an individual property -the maximal acquaintance parameter ¦Ë i as well as a specic degree ¦° i = k i / j k j , which denes the probability to be added into another agent's contact list, ¦° i corresponds to the preferential attachment of the BA-model and k i is the degree or the number of dierent contacts of agent i. Additionally every agent keeps a list of all its encounters and a relative desire p ij to meet this contact again. The friendship f ij between two agents i and j is dened as a function of the total number of contacts n ij</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f ij = f (n ij ) = 1 ? e ?nij (1)</formula><p>where we have chosen an exponential saturation, meaning that another agent will become a better friend the more often the two agents meet, however after many encounters the total number does not play such an important role any more. While one could imagine that a generalization like f (n ij ) = 1 ? e ?¦Çnij , where ¦Ç denes the number of times until the friendship reaches a value of 1 ? e ?1 would be more appropriate. It turns out, however, that the results do not substantially dier from the ones obtained with eq. (1). All further simulations were thus performed with eq. (1).</p><p>Each relative probability for meeting already known contacts is calculated as p ij = f ij / k f ik . The maximal acquaintance parameters ¦Ë i are chosen to be normally distributed around one with a variance ¦Ò. The ¦Ë i represent the willingness of an agent i to make new connections. Not every agent is equally involved in this system (e.g. at an university) since it might possess some friends already, which are outside the system. We assume as a rst approximation a normal distribution.</p><p>An agent can choose to meet either yet unknown agents or agents in the contact list. The probability for agent i to meet an agent in the contact list is given by corresponds to the distance 1/ ¡Ì ¦Ò from the expectation value of the normal distribution. For p &gt; 1 ? ¦È ¦Ò new contacts are not accepted any more. Thus the agent has built up its individual social community. Newly met agents are only admitted to the agent's list if they present an added value: then the new contact replaces an old one. This threshold prevents social isolation and accounts for benecial random encounters since the probability to meet new agents does not drop below this threshold. As the contacts are chosen probabilistically it may happen that an agent i tries to make an acquaintance with an agent j, which has already a full contact list. The agent j can then decide to reject the contact or conversely accept it in case that the possible friendship f ij is larger than one of the f jk in the contact list of j. Then the old weak contact is dropped in favor of the new link with agent i.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p = 1 ? e ?¦Ë i k i (2)</formula><p>where k i is the degree, i.e. the number of encounters with dierent other agents. Thus the probability to meet a yet unknown agent outside the contact list is 1 ? p, decaying strongly with increasing size of the contact list. Depending on the agent's ¦Ë i the contact list increases in time. The probability to meet outside agents decreases accordingly but never vanishes. However in order to prevent an unbounded growth of the list, which would lead eventually to a fully connected network a xed threshold</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">¦È ¦Ò = 1/ ¡Ì 4¦Ðe ?1/¦Ò</formula><p>2 was introduced, which is the largest number of contacts the agent can have. This threshold Intuitively one nds that the number of encounters alone cannot be the only objective quantity, which denes friendship. Otherwise the people we meet every day like working colleagues, neighbors, school mates, newspaper agents etc. would all be part of our best friends. While meeting people often naturally leads to a certain familiarity, friendships do not necessarily develop. Thus we introduce a second characteristic -the anity a i of an agent i, which summarizes the agents elds of interest. The anities can be distributed according to any kind of distribution P a . An agent tends to optimize its friends in the contact list with respect to its own interest a i , while maintaining the maximal possible amount of contacts. Thus in terms of networks each node optimizes its interest under the constraint of a xed degree distribution (nodewise optimization). We introduce a decaying </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">interest match function f m (a i , a j ) = 1 1 ? e ?1 ¡¤ e ?|a i ?a j | ? e ?1 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Figure 4: Friendship distribution normalized: Connectivities for the friendship network of 417 high school students, where the number of links corresponds to the number of times a student is chosen by another student as one of his/hers two best friends. The experimental data (triangles) was taken from Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>. The calculated data of the present model is superimposed. The distribution is Gaussian and is in excellent agreement with the experiments.</p><p>which is essentially a rescaled exponential decay so that it is 1 for |a i ?a j | = 0 and 0 for |a i ?a j | = 1. By multiplying the friendship function with the match function</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f ij = f (n ij ) ¡¤ f m (a i , a j )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>we have introduced a friendship optimization. Hence, with time, every agent optimizes the contacts, which t to its own taste and local self-organized social communities of common interest naturally emerge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Measurable network quantities</head><p>First we study the model independently on the interests a i by using the friendship function of eq. (1). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> shows the degree distribution for averaged data of 84 schools in USA where questionnaires from 90118 students were evaluated <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>. This data is compared to the model of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref> (thick lines) and the present model (thin line). The results for the present model have been averaged over 10000 realizations for N a = 1000 and 500 realizations for N a = 10000 for ¦Ò = 2.8. It can be seen that the calculated results t the data much better than exponential or Poisson distributions and is in agreement with the calculations of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref>. However, the data of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref> ts the experiments only up to a degree of k = 15, for higher degrees a substantial deviation is observed. For the present model with N a = 1000 nite size eects are observed, which lead to a deviation after k &gt; 23. These eects do not occur any more for N a = 10000 where the whole range of the experimental data is predicted accurately. The experimental data in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> is averaged over all 84 high schools. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> the degree correlation K nn (k) is shown. It can be seen that the calculated results match well to the experimental ones.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> the normalized cumulative friendship distribution is plotted against the total amount of being chosen to be a friend. The experimental data of the friendship network of 417 Madison Junior High School students were taken from Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11]</ref>. The connectivity distribution shows no power law regime but can be tted well with a Gaussian distribution showing the single scale character of the network. The number of links in this network corresponds to the number of times a student was chosen by another student as one of his/hers two best friends. The simulations with the present model indicate a Gaussian distribution as well. The simulated results are in accordance with the experimental data.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref> the clustering coecient of the experimental data of the 84 high schools is plotted as a function of the average degree. The thick solid line indicates the results obtained with the proposed model using the same range of values of &lt; k &gt;, averaged over 50 realizations. The parameters used are N a = 800, ¦Ò ¡Ê <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">4]</ref> . For comparison the data obtained in Gonz¨¢lez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref> using the mobile agents approach is plotted as well. It can be seen clearly that both models reproduce well the clustering coecient within the error bars for the same average degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Interest -network optimization</head><p>The model so far reproduces all the statistically measurable quantities, which can be determined from a purely statistical approach. Now we study the inuence In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7a</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7b</ref> a network with N a = 100 and 500 agents is shown, respectively. The layout has been calculated by the Kamada-Kawai algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>, which connects the agents by springs, whose interaction force is proportional to the shortest path in the network. The positions of the individual agents are calculated by nding the minimum energy conguration of the spring system. The anities a i are plotted with dierent colors (0: dark red, 1: dark blue). As can be seen the communities formed after 30000 sweeps separate the red, green and blue agents rather well. Superimposed are the results of a conventional community detection algorithm (Girvan-Newman <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>). The detection led to only three resp. two major communities, which separates the groups red, yellow-green and blue in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7a</ref> and the groups redyellow-green and blue in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7b</ref>. The community boundaries are in accordance with the communities formed by interest, however the latter creates a much ner community detection and separation. For the sake of simplicity we have assumed here a uniform distribution of the a i ¡Ê [0, 1], however the results seem to hold for arbitrary distributions P a . In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6</ref> the friendship optimization of eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(4)</ref> is shown for different numbers of sweeps for the parameters ¦Ò = 2.8 and N a = 1000. The decay of the function f m of eq. (3) determines the time scale at which the agents optimize their friendships. Any monotonically decreasing function will eventually optimize. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6</ref> also shows that the initial distribution is close to triangular as expected for friendship independent of a i , which indicates that the optimization sets in once some of the agents have a full contact list. Once all agents have a fully occupied contact list, optimization is the only way to change the network. We introduce a model, based on non-moving agents, who build up connections based on preferential attachments in the beginning, and later, when the contact lists are lled up, on the emerging social community stored in the contact list. This model seems to build a bridge between the results obtained by the mobile agents calculations of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref> and the more traditional network structure models, in that it reproduces all the experimental results and is inherently single scale. Yet it is composed of standard elements and tools commonly used in the eld of social networks. It is especially worth noting that the later stage development of the network is essentially a densely interconnected set of BA-networks, which as a whole show static, converged distributions. In this sense it can be considered as a network of interconnected networks, which reproduces accurately experimental data.</p><p>The present model remedies some inconveniences of the mobile agent model. In particular no spatial topology is imposed and the notion of friendship is clearly dened by eq. (4) and distinguished from simple encounters. Our model is capable of reproducing experimental data and is in excellent agreement with measured degree distributions, clustering coecients and friendship distributions. Additionally friendship emerges from a local optimization process, which takes place under constant degree distribution. The emerging communities based on the interest are in accordance with conventional community detection algorithms.</p><p>The simulations show that the build up of acquaintances is a much faster process than nding friends. Thus rst one possible network is created which lls up all the possible contacts lists. Optimization of the friends takes place only after this initial stage. Thus nding good friends is much harder than acquiring acquaintances. Agents are forced to nd friends in the environment they are placed in. If the selection is too limited no friends or rather in absolute values of a particular agent only bad friends are found. The total number of good friends is directly related to the number of acquaintances an agent can have since it increases the probability to meet other agents. In particular the number of encounters provides the statistical framework for the comparison with experimental data whereas the mutual interest optimizes the network to form matching community structures. Superimposed are the results of the community structure detection of the Girvan-Newman algorithm. The communities of the interest match well with the community structure of Girvan-Newman.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Friendship network of N = 100 agents.</figDesc></figure>
