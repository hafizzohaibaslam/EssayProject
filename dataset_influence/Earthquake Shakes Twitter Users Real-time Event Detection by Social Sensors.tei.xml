<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">EVENT DETECTION</head><p>As described in this paper, we target event detection. An event is an arbitrary classification of a space-time region. An event might have actively participating agents, passive factors, products, and a location in space/time <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. We target events such as earthquakes, typhoons, and traffic jams, which are visible through tweets. These events have several properties: i) they are of large scale (many users experience the event), ii) they particularly influence people's daily life (for that reason, they are induced to tweet about it), and iii) they have both spatial and temporal regions (so that real-time location estimation is possible). Such events include social events such as large parties, sports events, exhibitions, accidents, and political campaigns. They also include natural events such as storms, heavy rainfall, tornadoes, typhoons/hurricanes/cyclones, and earthquakes. We designate an event we would like to detect using Twitter as a target event.</p><p>We can search the tweet and classify it into a positive class if a user makes a tweet on a target event. In other words, the user functions as a sensor of the event. If she makes a tweet about an earthquake occurrence, then it can be considered that she, as an "earthquake sensor", returns a positive value. A tweet can therefore be considered as a sensor reading. This is a crucial assumption but it enables application of various methods related to sensory information. Assumption 2.1 Each Twitter user is regarded as a sensor. A sensor detects a target event and makes a report probabilistically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Semantic Analysis on Tweet</head><p>To detect a target event from Twitter, we search from Twitter and find useful tweets. Tweets might include mentions of the target event. For example, users might make tweets such as "Earthquake!" or "Now it is shaking". Consequently, earthquake or shaking might be keywords (which we call query words). But users might also make tweets such as "I am attending an Earthquake Conference", or "Someone is shaking hands with my boss". Moreover, even if a tweet is referring to the target event, it might not be appropriate as an event report. For instance, a user makes tweets such as "The earthquake yesterday was scaring", or "Three earthquakes in four days. Japan scares me." These tweets are truly descriptions of the target event, but they are not real-time reports of the events. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify that a tweet is truly referring to an actual earthquake occurrence, which is denoted as a positive class.</p><p>To classify a tweet into a positive class or a negative class, we use a support vector machine (SVM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which is a widely used machine-learning algorithm. By preparing positive and negative examples as a training set, we can produce a model to classify tweets automatically into positive and negative categories.</p><p>We prepare three groups of features for each tweet as follows:</p><p>The virtual sensors (or social sensors) have various characteristics: some sensors are activated (i.e. make tweets) only by specific events, although others are activated to a wider range of events. The sensors are vastly numerous; there are more than 40 million "Twitter sensors" worldwide. A sensor might be inoperable or operating incorrectly sometimes (which means a user is not online, sleeping, or is busy doing something). Therefore, this social sensor is noisier than ordinal physical sensors such as location sensors, thermal sensors, and motion sensors.</p><p>A tweet can be associated with a time and location: each tweet has its post time, which is obtainable using a search API. In fact, GPS data are attached to a tweet sometimes, e.g. when a user is using an iPhone. Alternatively, each Twitter user makes a registration on their location in the user profile. The registered location might not be the current location of a tweet. However, we think it is probable that a person is near the registered location. For this study, we use GPS data and the registered location of a user. We do not use the tweet for spatial analysis if the location is not available (We use the tweet information for temporal analyses.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assumption 2.2 Each tweet is associated with a time and location, which is a set of latitude and longitude.</head><p>Features A (statistical features) the number of words in a tweet message, and the position of the query word within a tweet.</p><p>Features B (keyword features) the words in a tweet <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</p><p>By regarding a tweet as a sensory value associated with a location information, the event detection problem is reduced to detecting an object and its location from sensor readings. Estimating an object's location is arguably the most fundamental sensing task in many ubiquitous and pervasive computing scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> presents an illustration of the correspondence between sensory data detection and tweet processing. The motivations are the same for both cases: to detect a target event. Observation by sensors corresponds to an observation by Twitter users. They are converted into values by a classifier. A probabilistic model is used to detect an event, as described in the next section.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">MODEL</head><p>For event detection and location estimation, we use probabilistic models. In this section, we first describe event detection from time-series data. Then we describe the location estimation of a target event. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Temporal Model</head><p>classifier misclassifies a tweet into a positive class. We can design the alarm probabilistically using the following two facts:</p><p>Each tweet has its post time. When a target event occurs, how can the sensors detect the event? We describe the temporal model of event detection.</p><p>First, we examine the actual data. Figures 4 and 5 respectively present the numbers of tweets for two target events: an earthquake and a typhoon. It is apparent that spikes occur on the number of tweets. Each corresponds to an event occurrence. In the case of an earthquake, more than 10 earthquakes occur during the period. In the case of typhoon, Japan's main population centers were hit by a large typhoon (designated as Melor) in October 2009.</p><p>The distribution is apparently an exponential distribution. The probability density function of the exponential distribution is f (t; ¦Ë) = ¦Ëe ?¦Ët where t &gt; 0 and ¦Ë &gt; 0. The exponential distribution occurs naturally when describing the lengths of the inter-arrival times in a homogeneous Poisson process.</p><p>In the Twitter case, we can infer that if a user detects an event at time 0, assume that the probability of his posting a tweet from t to ?t is fixed as ¦Ë. Then, the time to make a tweet can be considered as an exponential distribution. Therefore, even if a user detects an event, she might not make a tweet right away if she is not online or doing something. She might make a post only after such problems are resolved. Therefore, it is reasonable that the distribution of the number of tweets follows an exponential distribution. Actually the data fit very well to an exponential distribution; we get ¦Ë = 0.34 with R 2 = 0.87 on average. To assess an alarm, we must calculate the reliability of multiple sensor values. For example, a user might make a false alarm by writing a tweet. It is also possible that the ? The false-positive ratio p f of a sensor is approximately 0.35, as we show in Section 4.1.</p><p>? Sensors are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), as we explain in Section 3.3.</p><p>Assuming that we have n sensors, which produce positive signals, the probability of all n sensors returning a false alarm is p n f . Therefore, the probability of event occurrence can be estimated as 1 ? p n f . Given n 0 sensors at time 0 and n 0 e ?¦Ët sensors at time t. Therefore, the number of sensors we expect at time t is n 0 (1 ? e ?¦Ë(t+1) )/(1 ? e ?¦Ë ). Consequently, the probability of an event occurrence at time t is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">poccur(t) = 1 ? p n 0 (1?e ?¦Ë(t+1) )/(1?e ?¦Ë ) f .</formula><p>We can calculate the probability of event occurrence if we set ¦Ë = 0.34 and p f = 0.35. For example, if we receive n 0 positive tweets and would like to make an alarm with a false-positive ratio less than 1%, then we can calculate the expected wait time t wait to deliver the notification as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">twait = (1 ? (0.1264/n0))/0.7117 ? 1.</formula><p>Although many works describing event detection have been reported in the data mining field, we use this simple approach utilizing the characteristics of the classifier and the distribution.</p></div>

For location estimation, it maintains a probability distribution for the location estimation at time t, designated as the belief Bel(x t ) = {x t , w t }, i = 1 . . . n. Each x t is a discrete hypothesis about the location of the object. The w i consider both the location and the velocity of an event. We apply Newton's motion equation as follows:</p></div>

Apply the classification to obtain value v t = {0, 1}.</p><p>Some information related to an event diffuses through Twitter. For example, if a user detects an earthquake and makes a tweet about the earthquake, then a follower of that user might make tweets about that. This characteristic is important because, in our model, sensors might not be mutually independent, which would have an undesired effect in terms of event detection. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figures 6, 7</ref>, and 8 respectively portray the information flow networks for an earthquake, a typhoon, and a new Nintendo DS game <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . We infer the network as follows: Assume that user A follows user B. If user B makes a tweet about an event, and soon thereafter user A makes a tweet about an event, then we consider the information flows from B to A 10 . This definition is similar to those used in other studies of information diffusion (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>).</p><p>In the case of earthquakes and typhoons, very little information diffusion takes place on Twitter.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATION</head><p>In this section, we describe the experimental results and evaluation of tweet classification and location estimation.</p><p>The whole algorithm is shown in Algo. 2. We prepare a set of queries Q for a target event. We first search for tweets T including the query set Q from Twitter every s seconds. We use a search API 11 to search tweets. In the earthquake case, we set Q = {"earthquake" and "shaking"}; in the typhoon case, we set Q = {"typhoon"}. We set s as 3 s. After determining a classification and obtaining a positive example, the system makes a calculation of a temporal and spatial probabilistic model. We consider that an event is detected if the probability is higher than a certain threshold (poccur(t) &gt; 0.95 in our case). The location information of each tweet is obtained and used for location estimation of the event. In the earthquake reporting system explained in the next section, the system quickly sends an e-mail (usually mobile e-mail) to registered users. A and all features. Surprisingly, features B and feature C do not contribute much to the classification performance. When an earthquake occurs, a user becomes surprised and might produce a very short tweet. It is apparent that the recall is not so high as the precision. That result is attributable to the usage of query words in a different context than we intend. Sometimes it is difficult even for humans to judge whether a tweet is reporting an actual earthquake or not. Some examples are that a user might write "Is this an earthquake or a truck passing?" Overall, the classification performance is good considering that we can use multiple sensor readings as evidence for event detection.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Evaluation by Semantic Analysis</head><p>For classification of tweets, we prepared 597 positive examples that report earthquake occurrence as a training set. The classification performance is presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. We use two query words-earthquake and shaking; performances using either query are shown. We used a linear kernel for SVM. We obtain the highest F -value when we use feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> We sample tweets associated with locations and obtain a user distribution that is proportional to the number of tweets in each region. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> Love Plus, a game that offers a virtual girlfriend experience, which was recently released in <ref type="bibr">September 3, 2009. 10</ref> Because of this definition, the diffusion includes retweet, which is a type of message that repeats some information that was previously tweeted by another user. 11 search.twitter.com <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 9</ref> presents the location estimation of an earthquake on August 11. We can find that many tweets originate from a wide region in Japan. The estimated location of the earthquake (shown as estimation by particle filter) is close to the actual center of the earthquake, which shows the efficiency of the location estimation algorithm. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> presents results of location estimation based on a total of 621 tweets for 25 earthquakes in August, September, and October, 2009. We compare Kalman filtering and particle filtering, with the weighted average and the median as a baseline. The weighted average simply takes the average of latitudes and longitude on all the positive tweets, and median simply takes their median. Particle filters perform well compared to other methods. The poor performance of Kalman filtering implies that the linear Gaussian assumption does not hold for this problem. We can find that if the center of the earthquake is in an oceanic area, it is more difficult to locate it precisely from tweets. Similarly, it becomes more difficult to make     good estimations in less-populated areas. That is reasonable: all other things being equal, the greater the number of sensors, the more precise the estimation will be. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> depicts a trajectory estimation of typhoon Melor based on a total of 2037 tweets. In the case of an earthquake, the center is one location. However, in the case of a typhoon, the center moves and produces a trajectory. A comparison of the performance is presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>. The particle filter works well and outputs a trajectory resembling the actual trajectory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">EARTHQUAKE REPORTING SYSTEM</head><p>We developed an earthquake reporting system using the event detection algorithm. Earthquake information is much more valuable if it is received in real time. We could turn off a stove or heater in our house and hide ourselves under a desk or table if we were to have several seconds' notice before an earthquake actually hits. Several Twitter accounts report earthquake occurrence. Some examples are that the United States Geological Survey (USGS) feeds tweets on world earthquake information, but such information is not useful for prediction or early warning.</p><p>Vast amounts of work have been done on intermediateterm earthquake prediction in the seismology field (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>). Various attempts have also been made to produce shortterm forecasts to realize an earthquake warning system by observing electromagnetic emissions from ground-based sensors and satellites <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Other precursor signals such as ionospheric changes, infrared luminescence, and air-conductivity change, along with traditional monitoring of movements of the earth's crust, are investigated. In Japan, the government has allocated a considerable amount of its budget to mitigating earthquake damage. An earthquake early warning service has been operated by JMA since 2007. It provides advance announcements of the estimated seismic intensities and expected arrival times. It detects P-waves (primary waves) and makes an alert immediately so that earthquake damage can be mitigated through countermeasures such as slowing trains and controlling elevators. In fact, P-waves are a type of elastic wave that can travel faster than S-waves (secondary waves), which cause shear effects and engender much more damage.</p><p>The proposed system, called Toretter 12 , has been operated since August 8 of this year. A system screenshot is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref>. Users can see the detection of past earthquakes. They can register their e-mails to receive notices of future earthquake detection reports. A sample e-mail is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>. It alerts users and urges them to prepare for     the earthquake. It is hoped that the e-mail is received by a user shortly before the earthquake actually arrives. An earthquake is transmitted through the earth's crust at about 3-7 km/s. Therefore, a person has about 20 s before its arrival at a point that is 100 km distant. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref> presents some facts about earthquake detection and notification using our system. This table shows that we investigated 10 earthquakes during 18 August -2 September, all of which our system detected. The first tweet of an earthquake is usually made within a minute or so. The delay can result from the time for posting a tweet by a user, the time to index the post in Twitter servers, and the time to make queries by our system. We apply classification for 49,314 tweets retrieved by query words in one month; results show 6,291 positive tweets posted by 4,218 users. Every earthquake elicited more than 10 tweets within 10 min, except one in Bungo-suido, which is the sea between two large islands: Kyushu and Shikoku. Our system sent e-mails mostly within a minute, sometimes within 20 s. The delivery time is far faster than the rapid broadcast of announcements of JMA, which are widely broadcast on TV; on average, a JMA announcement is broadcast 6 min after an earthquake occurs. Statistically, we detected 96% of earthquakes that were stronger than JMA seismic intensity scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> 3 or more as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>.</p><note type="other">: Location estimation accuracy of earthquakes from tweets.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">RELATED WORK</head><p>Twitter is an interesting example of the most recent social media: numerous researchers have examined Twitter. Aside from the studies introduced into Section 1, several <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> The JMA seismic intensity scale is a measure used in Japan and Taiwan to indicate earthquake strength. Unlike the Richter magnitude scale, the JMA scale describes the degree of shaking at a point on the earth's surface. For example, the JMA scale 3 is, by definition, one which is "felt by most people in the building. Some people are frightened". It is similar to the Modified Mercalli scale IV, which is used along with the Richter scale in the US.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Toretter Alert System</head><p>Figure 12: Sample alert e-mail.</p><p>others have been done. Grosseck et al. investigated indicators such as the influence and trust related to Twitter <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Krishnamurthy et al. crawled nearly 100,000 Twitter users and examined the number of users that each user follows, in addition to the number of users following them. Naaman et al. analyzed contents of messages from more than 350 Twitter users and manually classified messages into nine categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The numerous categories are "Me now" and "Statements and Random Thoughts"; statements about current events corresponding to this category. Some studies have examined novel applications of Twitter: Borau et al. tried to use Twitter to teach English to English-language learners <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Ebner et al. investigated the applicability of Twitter for educational purposes, i.e. mobile learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The integration of the Semantic Web and microblogging was described in a previous report <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> in which a distributed architecture is proposed and the contents are aggregated. Jensen et al. analyzed more than 150 thousand tweets, particularly those mentioning brands in corporate accounts <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>In contrast to the small number of academic studies of Twitter, numerous Twitter applications exist. Some are used for analyses of Twitter data. For example, Tweettronics 14 provides an analysis of tweets related to brands and products for marketing purposes. It can classify positive and negative tweets, and can identify influential users. The classification of tweets might be done similarly to our algorithm. Web2express Digest 15 is a website that autodiscovers information from Twitter streaming data to find real-time interesting conversations. It also uses natural language processing and sentiment analysis to discover interesting topics, as we do in our study.</p><p>Various studies have been made of the analysis of web data (except for Twitter) particularly addressing the spatial aspect: The most relevant study to ours is one by Backstrom et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. They use queries with location (obtained by IP addresses), and develop a probabilistic framework for quantifying spatial variation. The model is based on a decomposition of the surface of the earth into small grid cells; they assume that for each grid cell x, there is a probability px that a random search from this cell will be equal to the query under consideration. The framework finds a query's geographic center and spatial dispersion. Examples include baseball teams, newspapers, universities, and typhoons. Although the motivation is very similar, events to be detected differ. Some examples are that people might not make a search query earthquake when they experience an earthquake. Therefore, our approach complements their work. Similarly to our work, Mei et al. targeted blogs and analyzed their spatiotemporal patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. They presented examples for Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, and iPod Nano. The motivation of that study is similar to ours, but Twitter data are more time-sensitive; our study examines even more time-critical events e.g. earthquakes.</p><p>Some works have targeted collaborative bookmarking data, as Flickr does, from a spatiotemporal perspective: Serdyukov et al. investigated generic methods for placing photographs on Flickr on the world map <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. They used a language model to place photos, and showed that they can estimate the language model effectively through analyses of annotations by users. Rattenbury et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> specifically examined the problem of extracting place and event semantics for tags that are assigned to photographs on Flickr. They proposed scale-structure identification, which is a burst-detection method based on scaled spatial and temporal segments.</p><p>Location estimation studies are often done in the field of ubiquitous computing. Estimating an object's location is arguably the most fundamental sensing task in many ubiquitous and pervasive computing scenarios. Representing locations statistically provides a unified interface for location information, which enables us to make applications independent of the sensors used-even when using very different sensor types, such as GPS and infrared badges <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, or even Twitter. Well known algorithms for location estimation are Kalman filters, multihypothesis tracking, grid-based, and topological approaches, and particle filters. Hightower and Borriello investigated the application of particle filters to location sensors deployed throughout a lab building <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. More than 30 lab residents were tracked; their locations were estimated accurately using the particle filter approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">DISCUSSION</head><p>We plan to expand our system to detect events of various kinds using Twitter. We developed another prototype that detects rainbow information. A rainbow might be visible somewhere in the world; someone might be twittering about a rainbow. Our system can identify rainbow tweets using a similar approach to that used for detecting earthquakes. The differences are that in the rainbow case, the information is not so time-sensitive as that in the earthquake case.</p><p>Our model includes the assumption that a single instance of the target event exists. For example, we assume that no two or more earthquakes or typhoons occur simultaneously. Although that assumption is reasonable for these cases, it might not hold for other events such as traffic jams, accidents, and rainbows. To realize multiple event detection, we must produce advanced probabilistic models that can accommodate multiple event occurrences.</p><p>A search query is important for seeking tweets that might be relevant. For example, we set query terms as earthquake and shaking because most tweets mentioning an earthquake occurrence use either word. However, to improve the recall, it is necessary to obtain a good set of queries. We can use advanced algorithms for query expansion, which is a subject of our future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">CONCLUSION</head><p>As described in this paper, we investigated the real-time nature of Twitter, in particular for event detection. Semantic analyses were applied to tweets to classify them into a positive and a negative class. We consider each Twitter user as a sensor, and set a problem to detect an event based on sensory observations. Location estimation methods such as Kalman filtering and particle filtering are used to estimate the locations of events. As an application, we developed an earthquake reporting system, which is a novel approach to notify people promptly of an earthquake event.</p><p>Microblogging has real-time characteristics that distinguish it from other social media such as blogs and collaborative bookmarks. As described in this paper, we presented an example using the real-time nature of Twitter. It is hoped that this paper provides some insight into the future integration of semantic analysis with microblogging data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Twitter user map.</figDesc></figure>

Users can know how other users are doing and often what they are thinking about now, users repeatedly return to the site and check to see what other people are doing. The large number of updates results in numerous reports related to events. They include social events such as parties, baseball games, and presidential campaigns. They also include disastrous events such as storms, fires, traffic jams, riots, heavy rainfall, and earthquakes. Actually, Twitter is used for various real-time notification such as that necessary for help during a large-scale fire emergency and live traffic updates.
