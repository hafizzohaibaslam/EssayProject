				<p>Link prediction in complex networks is an important issue in graph mining. It aims at estimating the likelihood of the existence of links between nodes by the know network structure information. Currently, most link prediction algorithms based on local information consider only the individual characteristics of common neighbors. In this paper, first, we study the link prediction results as the change of the exponent on the degree of common neighbors, and find some regular pattern between different networks and different exponent. After that, we come up with a new algorithm exploiting the interactions between common neighbors, namely Individual Attraction Index. To reduce the time complexity, we design a simple edition, called Simple Individual Attraction Index. We compare nine well-known local information metrics on eight real networks. The result proves well the best overall performance of these two new algorithms. of small world networks to assess confidence for individual protein-protein interactions. Kleinberg and Liben-Nowell [8] empirically investigated the similarity-based prediction indices for large scientific collaboration networks. In 2008, Clauset et al. [9] proposes a hierarchical structure method to link prediction, this algorithm has good result in the network which has obvious hierarchy. In addition, Lichtenwalter et al. [10] proposed a supervised learning framework for link prediction. It uses the classification algorithm to predict links. In recent years, link prediction based on node similarity has become a research focus.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Link prediction in data mining has attracted increasing attention from complex networks communities, it refers to how to predict the possibility of the existence of a link between two nodes based on observed links and the attributes of two nodes. Link prediction includes: (1) one is the prediction of missing links in sampling network such as the World Wide Web network; (2) the other is the prediction of links that may exist in the future of evolving networks such as the phone call network. This paper focuses on the problem of predicting the unknown links.</p><p>Recently, the link prediction based on node similarity take more and more focus on the degree of common neighbors. The different functions on the degree of common neighbor have an effect on the accuracy rate of link prediction. To know the relationship between the variation of different degree functions and different networks, in this paper, we make an intensive experiment by changing the exponent of the degree of common neighbors. At the same time, traditional link prediction algorithms based on node similarity only consider the number of common neighbors between two nodes predicted and the degree of common neighbors, and do not study the relationships between common neighbors in depth. This paper proposes a new link prediction algorithm, Individual Attraction Index (IA), and its simple edition, Simple Individual Attraction Index (SIA). The two algorithms take not only the common neighbors themselves but also the impact of the small network formed by the common neighbors. The new algorithms achieved good results comparing other nine well-known nodesimilarity algorithms.</p><p>Early research ideas and methods for the link prediction are based on external information besides the network topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Graven et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> predicted the semantic relationship of the World Wide Web with the help of web content. Popescul and Ungar <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> designed a regression model to predict citations made in scientific literature based not only on the citation graph, but also on authorship, journal information and content. Taskar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> used the relational Markov network algorithm to predict missing links in social network, in which the welldefined attributes of each node are exploited. Madadhain et al.</p><p>[5] constructed local conditional probability modes for link prediction, based on both structural features and nodes' attributes. The content and attribute information are generally not available and thus the applications of the above algorithms are strongly limited, although the usage of external information can somewhat enhance the algorithmic accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Goldberg and Roth <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> exploited the neighborhood cohesiveness property This paper is organized as follows: The second section gives a brief description about link prediction and the evaluation, also the datasets and other nine known metrics used in the paper; Section 3 try to find the relationship between the exponent on the degree of common neighbors; Section 4 and Section 5 propose two new link prediction metrics; In Section 6, eight real data sets are used to compare the experimental results of different metrics; The last section is a brief summary of the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PRELIMINARIES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Problem Description</head><p>Denote an unweighted undirected simple network GGV, EE, where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of edges. There are not multiple links and self-connections. We assign a score S for each pair of nodes x and y. Every nonexistent edge has a score and all are sorted in decreasing order by their scores, and the edges in the top are most likely to exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. In this paper, we directly set the similarity as the score, so the higher similarity means higher score, and vice versa.</p><p>To test the accuracy of the metric, the observed links, E, is randomly divided into two parts: the training set is treated as know information, while the probe set is used for testing. Clearly, the total numbers of nodes and links. de is the density of network, and k is the average degree. C and r are the clustering coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> and assortative coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. Nc denotes the size of the giant component. For example, the entry 379/268 means that the network has 268 components and the giant component consists of 379 nodes. Cc denotes the size of the clique in the network and it has the same meaning with Cc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>and</head><p>To split the set well, we sue the , in which the observed edges is randomly partitioned into subsets. Each time one subset is selected as probe set, the rest constitute the training set. The cross-validation process is then repeated times, with each of the subsets used exactly once as the probe set. With this method, all edges are used for both training and validation, and each edge is used for prediction exactly once. A larger will lead to smaller statistical bias yet require more computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. Some experimental evidences suggested that the 10 is a very good tradeoff between cost and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Nine Metrics</head><p>In <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, we introduce nine well-known link prediction metrics. All these metrics are based on node similarity. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Evaluation Metrics</head><p>In this paper, we use area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> metrics to quantify the accuracy of prediction algorithms. The AUC evaluates the performance of the metric according to the whole list of all non-observed edges(</p><p>).</p><p>k Leicht-Holme-Newman Index(LHN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> S |¦Õ ¦Õ k k Sorensen Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> S |¦Õ ¦Õ k k Jaccard Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> S |¦Õ ¦Õ |¦Õ ¦Õ Hub Promotel Index(HPI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> S |¦Õ ¦Õ min ,k Hub Depressed Index(HDI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> S |¦Õ ¦Õ</p><p>The AUC metric can be interpreted as the probability that a randomly chosen missing edge is given a higher score than a randomly chosen nonexistent edge. In the implementation, among independent comparisons, if there are occurrences of the missing link having a higher score and occurrences of the missing edge and nonexistent edge having the same score, we define the metric as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">min ,k Preferential Attachment Index(PA) S k k Adamic-Adar Index(AA) [18] S 1 logk</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE REGULAR PATTERNS</head><p>AUC n 0.5n If all the scores are generated from an independent and identical distribution, the AUC value should be about 0.5. Therefore, the degree to which the value exceeds 0.5 indicates how much better the algorithm performs than pure chance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. DataSet</head><p>In this paper, we use eight representative public network: Co-authorships in network science(NS), Power Grid(PG), Political Blogs(PB), High-energy theory collaborations (Hep) , Alex Arenas's Jazz (Jazz), Alex Arenas's Email(Email), Neural network of Elegans(Cele) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, US Air(USAir) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. The basic topological features are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. N and M are</p><p>The former study in link prediction based on node similarity place much attention on the change of the degree of common neighbor, some functions have been act on the degree, such as logarithmic function, linear function. To exploit the relationship between the degree and the result of link prediction, in this section, we provide a start point to investigate the role of different functions on the degree of common neighbors in link prediction by introducing a free parameter, The parameterdependent index for link prediction is:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S 1</head><p>As we mentioned above, z is the common neighbor of node x and node y, and stands for the degree of node z, and e is the exponent act on .  We take experiment for this topic in eight real networks with the change of from -2 to 2, and compare the accuracy rate with AUC Metric. The size of each change from -2 to 2 is 0.05 and each experiment result is the average of 10 times 10 fold cross validation . In AUC, we randomly select 100000 comparisons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>information. The new algorithm which we call Individual</head><p>Attraction Index (IA), consider the individual characteristics of common neighbors and relationship among them for link prediction.</p><p>From the <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, we can find some regular patterns between the index and accuracy. First, the regular patterns for AUC metrics can be summarized as:</p><p>1) The AUC accuracy increases as the index changing from -2 to 2 in five networks, Jazz, Cele, USAir, PB and Email network.</p><p>2) When 0, there is an obvious jump on the rising curves of the five networks mentioned above.</p><p>3) As the index e closes to 1.00, the accuracy by AUC is coming to the highest, which means the best result of link prediction.</p><p>Link prediction algorithms based on node similarity take the common neighbors of two nodes into consideration. Traditional algorithms only compute the individual impact of common neighbors, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2 (a)</ref> and (b), To get the likelihood of link existing between node and , Common Neighbors Index counts the number of common neighbors which is 5, because the common neighbors of node and are so the possibilities of having link between node and in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2 (a) and (b)</ref> are the same. The other algorithms take the degree of common neighbor for predicting the link, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> shows that the common neighbors have the same degree, so these algorithms have the same prediction results for node and 4) From the three patterns summarized above, we also find that the curves of the five networks are very similar and approximative.</p><p>5) The curves of Hep, PG and NS networks are both smooth lines. Although no common topological features of the three networks are find, we can take the three as special cases of the former four patterns.</p><p>From the summary, we can find that the optimal value of e is close to 1.00 for all cases based on AUC metric. More networks which have different topological features should be taken into experiments to look up the regular patterns between the exponent on the degree of common neighbors and networks with different topologies. Depended on these results, we think that further study about the inner structure of network is needed for link prediction, not only the separate common neighbors. Therefore, the traditional algorithms think that node and have the same link existing possibility in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>. The results of traditional nine measures will be demonstrated below. Extract a sub network which only contains seven nodes from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Because of the closer connection of <ref type="figure">Fig. 3(a)</ref> than the graph in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3(b)</ref>, we argue that the likelihood of link existence between node and in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2(a)</ref> is greater than <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2(b)</ref>. Therefore, we propose Individual Attraction Index which computes the possibility based on both the impact of individual common neighbors and the impact of the relationship of common neighbors. It defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">S e kkzz INDIVIDUAL ATTRACTION INDEX</formula><p>is the number of links among node with node and their common neighbors. We call these links Inner Link. The pseudo code of IA index is showed in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>In this section, we propose a new link prediction algorithm based on not only node similarity, but also node's local We can verify the conclusion mentioned above that the nine traditional link prediction algorithms have the same similarity for two different graphs in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> by detailed computation. And IA index gives different node similarities between node x,y in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2(a)</ref> and (b), because it takes the relationship between common neighbors into consideration. The computation of links between common neighbors in IA index is presented in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, line 7. After getting all common neighbors, it looks up the set of neighbors of each common neighbor. If there are other common neighbors in the set, there are links between common neighbors. IA index gives S larger scores, if there exist more links in the graph made up from common neighbors.  </p></div>

The result shows that IA and SIA algorithms improve the accuracy of link prediction by concerning the relationship between common neighbors. We find that link prediction for most of networks makes a good accuracy by observing the change of result from different networks, but the prediction for PG network is slightly better than random prediction accuracy which is 0.5.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>With the rapid development of complex networks, link prediction based on network structure has been continuously developed and improved. In the paper, firstly, we study the relationship between the exponent on the degree of common neighbors and networks with different topologies, and find a series regular patterns based on both AUC metric. Then, we propose a new link prediction algorithm, namely Individual Attraction Index, not only based on node similarity, but also local information of common neighbors. To reduce the time complexity, we also give a simple edition of IA, which we call SIA, although the time complexity of IA is not much higher than other algorithms. IA and SIA take the individual characteristics of common neighbors and the relationship between common neighbors into consideration. These two new algorithms achieve better prediction accuracy in eight different real networks with low time complexity.</p><p>In the future, we will focus on the problem of looking for the relationship between link prediction algorithms and network topology. At the same time, we also put our attention on the inner structure of networks for link prediction and study link prediction for large scale network.</p></div>
