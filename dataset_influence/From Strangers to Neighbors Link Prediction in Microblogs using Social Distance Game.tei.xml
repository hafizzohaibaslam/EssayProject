				<p>models [1]. Link prediction is an important research topic for social network. In this paper, we propose the notion of social distance considering both structural and interactive characteristics, to measure the closeness among a group of people in Microblogs. We then model the procedure of link prediction with a coalitional game in a directed graph under the concept of homophily. We explain the solution concept of generating predictive future neighbors for a given agent and propose a weighted social welfare maximization solution for social distance formation. Experiments were applied over a Twitter dataset of 140,000 users and 400,000,000 tweets, and the results testified the effectiveness of our game theoretic approach in predicting the likelihood of future associations between people. We consider link prediction in online social networks, specifically in the popular Microblogging platforms such as Twitter and Sina Weibo, where the associations between agents are represented in the notion of follow. We focus on the problem of from strangers to neighbors, that is, given an agent, the likelihood of its future neighbors is to be predicted. Note that the concept of neighbors here stands for the set of agents it follows. Link prediction has been studied far before the bloom of Internet in the field of sociometry. Leskovec et al. [2] analyzed an activity network based on user interaction in a large instant messaging network. They discovered that the activity network displayed strong influence of homophily in interaction, where similar users interact with each other in a considerably higher frequency, which means that similarity breeds connection and people tend to form communities with their own kind. The concept of homophily reveals the small world phenomenon, the principle that most of us are linked by short chains of acquaintances. Kleinberg&apos;s study [3] shows that individuals operating with purely local information are very adept at finding these short chains.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Social networks have been studied extensively in the context of analyzing interactions between people and exploring the structural properties in those interactions. Link prediction is an important task which leverages either the structure of the network or the attribute information at different agents to determine or predict future links. Link prediction also has many applications in different domains like information retrieval, bioinformatics and e-commerce. There exist a variety of structural and relational models in the literature for link prediction, ranging from feature-based classification and kernelbased method to matrix factorization and probabilistic graphical Most of the existing models formulate link prediction by a learning problem with a graphic representation, where a vertex represents an agent and an edge between two vertices represents the interaction between the two agents. The learning paradigm in this setup typically extracts the similarity between a pair of vertices by various graph-based similarity metrics and uses the ranking of the similarity scores to predict the link between two vertices <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Hasan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> considered the link prediction in a supervised machine learning setup, where a binary classification task is performed. They showed that using external data outside the scope of graph topology can significantly improve the prediction result, and then provided a comparison of various similarity metrics as features, such as the sum of neighbors, the shortest distance, the keyword match count etc. Different structural and relational models <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> [6] have also been proposed in the literature for link prediction. While prominent in modeling various social problems, game theoretic concepts have been ignored in link prediction. Recent years, the concepts of cooperative game theory, namely coalitional games attract more attentions in the academic world. Coalitional game shows how a group of self-interested players interact with each other to get more payoffs than they could achieve individually. Scott Shenker once said that "The Internet is an equilibrium, we just have to identify the game" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. We therefore believe that with an appropriate model, the problem of link prediction in social network can also be solved in a game theoretic way. Few game theoretic methods have been proposed to solve the link prediction task. Fabrikant et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> introduced a local connection game in which the edges have constant cost and the agents try to minimize their cost plus the sum of distances to all other pairs. However, the utility function partly considers a global objective which minimizes the distance to all pairs and may not be practical in Microblogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>game model by using a novel social distance definition. The information captured in microblogs is divided into two categories: structural features and interaction features. Structural features consist of relations between agents such as follow, neighbors and so on, which can be represented by a certain graph. Interaction features are content communications between agents, such as @, comments, interests, topics, etc., which can also be used to detect inherent associations.</p><p>We hold the idea that social networks exhibit homophily and that the agents prefer to create ties with other agents who are close to them. We analyze the interaction patterns of agents in Microblogs and extract a set of local agents as candidates. The local structure is then formulated with a directed weighted graph, and the notion of social distance is introduced to represent the closeness among agents. Finally, a sequence of certain agents, or potential neighbors, for the given agent is generated by a coalitional game framework.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">SOCIAL DISTANCE GAME 2.1 Motivation</head><p>To measure the closeness among people of a group, we present the definition of social distance which represents both structural and interaction characteristics. Firstly, social distance exists between every agent pair in the group. Some agent pairs, although without existing relations for now, may have latent associations in the future and should be studied by the link prediction models. The formation in social network is more than building a graph simply based on linkage information. How to quantify the distance between disconnected agents is a key issue. Secondly, in real world, social metric violates the triangle law, which can be taken as another view of the impact of dynamic of social networks. With the evolution of networks, some new links formed from latent associations. The change of the network structure leads to the mismatch of the original distance between agent pairs. As a result, any solutions based on former static states become meaningless. How to design the social distance in a persistent and comparable form that can be robust to the dynamic evolutions is another important problem.</p><p>interaction between an agent x and a candidate friend y has four types. Agents that follow x may communicate with x actively; Agents that followed by neighbors of x are those "friends of friends" and may be introduced to x through intermediate agents.</p><p>Agents with same neighbors or followers of x may share the same interests or involved in the same community.</p><p>Therefore we can get a local structure ( , )</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I N E ? ? ? ?</formula><p>(subgraph) for a given agent x (figure 2) according to the interaction patterns, in which the candidate agents set of future neighbors is defined as follow:  </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">{ } ( ) ( ( )) ( ) ( ( )) ( ( )) N x A x F A x F x F F x A F x ? ? ? ? ? ? ?</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">? 3.

By randomly selecting 10,000 Twitter users, updating their immediate neighbors per day from the period of Oct. 1 st and Nov. 19 th , 2012, we built the structural sub-graph. Meanwhile, we extracted the interaction data --tweets of these users per day --and used them to construct the interaction sub-graph, where agent x have relations with agent y if x 's tweet contains the syntax @ y or RT @ y , or equivalently, x retweets y or mentioned y in its tweets. In total, there are 140,000 users and 400,000,000 tweets. We randomly selected 1,000 pairs of snapshots of the dataset, and used the first snapshot to predict the following links in the second snapshot. The interval between these two snapshots is one week.</p><p>In which the sum of , k fi w captures the interaction characteristics and is combined with the minimum hops (range from 1 to 3) from agent j s to agent i f in the graph ( , ) I N E ? without</p><p>We selected four representative quantities which have been proven <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to perform reasonably well in previous studies to compare with our proposed approach. considering the direction, which represents the structural feature.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Coalitional Game Framework</head><p>A coalitional game model is considered to be a solution process with the definition of social distance. For a given agent x , we construct a local structure containing three types of agents: the agent x itself, the agent set of x 's followers and neighbors and the set of stranger agents. The aim of the game theoretic model is to find a proper strategy to make the coalition get best performance under certain solution concept. In our scenario, the utility for each agent in a coalition is designed to represent homophily according to the given agent x , that is, utility in our model is considered from more subjective viewpoints.</p><p>The number of followers and neighbors that agent x and y have in common:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">( , ) ( ) ( ) CN x y x y ? ? ? ? ,where ( ) ( ) ( ) x A x F x ?? ? . ?

We first diagrammatize the effectiveness of our social distance game to capture the interaction information in Microblogs through a subset of agents from the real world data as an example shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 3</ref>. For the given agent x , we construct the structural sub-graph and the interaction sub-graph.

As is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>, our strategy to calculate the similarity between x and 1 s obtains the largest value in the first row. This means for the agent <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> s , our measurement performs the best, which is consistent with the ground truth since x interacts more often with <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> s than with 2 s . This reveals that our method indeed characterize the truth that the formation of future link in Microblogs not only relies on the structural features of the network but also relies on the interaction behaviors between agents. Specifically, although agent 2 s has more topological features in common with the given agent x , it makes no communications in the local structure in the snapshot. Our method captured the interaction features with the definition of social distance in the form of using weights of intermediate agents.</p><p>agents who are close to them. The experimental results on a Twitter dataset proved the efficiency of our game model of predicting the likelihood of future associations between people in Microblogs.</p><p>In the future we will continue to use the notion of social distance as a measure for representing closeness between agents in social networks, and discuss different solution concepts of the proposed social distance game corresponding to different scenarios in social network.</p></div>

As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table  2</ref>, our method outperforms all the other measures Structural measures such as common neighbors, Jaccard's coefficient and Adamic-Adar get F-measures for the reason that no interaction information is captured.
