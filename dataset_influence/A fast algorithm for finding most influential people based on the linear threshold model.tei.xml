				<p>Finding the most influential people is an NP-hard problem that has attracted many researchers in the field of social networks. The problem is also known as influence maximization and aims to find a number of people that are able to maximize the spread of influence through a target social network. In this paper, a new algorithm based on the linear threshold model of influence maximization is proposed. The main benefit of the algorithm is that it reduces the number of investigated nodes without loss of quality to decrease its execution time. Our experimental results based on two well-known datasets show that the proposed algorithm is much faster and at the same time more efficient than the state of the art algorithms.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Social networks play an important role in our new world. After invention of online social networks, people are able to influence each other much more easily. This fact caused many researchers to look for an efficient method for finding top-k most influential people through social networks. This problem is also known as influence maximization (IM) and has many applications such as: opinion propagation, studying acceptance of political movements or acceptance of technology in economics. For example, suppose that we need to advertise a product in a country or we need to propagate news. For this purpose, we need to choose some people as a starting point and maximize the news or the products influence in the target society.</p><p>Finding most influential people has been found useful for many applications such as: developing recommender systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Morid, Shajari, &amp; Hashemi, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Song, Tseng, Lin, &amp; Sun, 2006</ref>), choosing useful weblogs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Leskovec et al., 2007</ref>) and finding influential twitters <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bakshy, Hofman, Mason, &amp; Watts, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Weng, Lim, Jiang, &amp; He, 2010</ref>). The problem was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Domingos &amp; Richardson, 2001</ref>) for the first time. After that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kempe, Kleinberg, &amp; Tardos, 2003</ref>) the authors formalized the problem as follows: given a weighted graph in which nodes are people and edge weights represent influence of the people on each other, it is desired to find K starting nodes that their activation leads to maximum propagation based on a chosen influence maximization model. Inspired from humanities science, two well-known influence maximization models were presented for the first time in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kempe et al., 2003)</ref>: Linear Threshold (LT) and Independent Cascade (IC). Also, different algorithms have been proposed based on IC model <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Morid et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wang, Cong, Song, &amp; Xie, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Zhang, Zhou, &amp; Cheng, 2011)</ref> and LT model <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brin &amp; Page, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Goyal, Bonchi, &amp; Lakshmanan, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Leskovec et al., 2007)</ref>. In this paper, a new algorithm will be introduced for finding top-k most influential people based on the LT model. Also, through experimental results on two real world datasets, we will show that the proposed algorithm is faster and even more efficient than the state of the art algorithms, so it would be applicable to larger social networks.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on selecting the most important nodes that lead to maximum influence based on the LT model. For this purpose, community structures of the input graph are identified first and the most influential communities are selected among them; then a number of representative nodes are chosen from the resulted communities and form the final output of the proposed algorithm. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm is very efficient in finding the most influential nodes with minimum execution time. In other words, in this paper we will focus on optimizing both the influence spread and the execution time.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the next section reviews the related works; the proposed algorithm is presented in Section 3; comparison and analysis of the results are presented in Section 4 and finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related works</head><p>As stated in the previous section, two different information diffusion processes are presented in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kempe et al., 2003)</ref>: IC and LT models. In IC model, when a node is activated in time t, it has only one chance to activate its neighbors in time t + 1. In LT model, inlinks of each node are weighted with a value less than one and each person has an activation threshold between zero and one. Then, if total influence rate of neighboring nodes of a node is greater than its threshold, the node will be activated.</p><p>The influence function is monotone and sub-modular in both models. The function set f: 2 U ? R + is monotone if f ?S? 6 f ?T? for all S # T # U. Also, if f ?S [ fwg? ? f ?S? P f ?T [ fwg? ? f ?T? is true for all S # T and w 2 U n T, then the function is sub-modular. So, both IT and IC models of influence maximization are NP-hard problems. Furthermore, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lu, Zhang, Wu, Kim, &amp; Fu, 2012</ref>) the authors study the complexity of the influence maximization problem in deterministic linear threshold model. They show that there is no n 1?e -factor polynomial time approximation for the problem in the deterministic linear threshold model unless P = NP. Also, they show that the exact computation of the influence given a seed set can be solved in polynomial time.</p><p>The rest of this section reviews LT and IC based influence maximization algorithms. Then the most important community detection algorithms are discussed and finally a formalization of linear threshold model will be presented. CELF. Then <ref type="bibr">Goyal et al. presented</ref> CELF++ that is an extension of CELF which reduces the number of iterations of the algorithm considerably <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Goyal, Lu, &amp; Lakshmanan, 2011a)</ref>.</p><p>There exists different works on influence models such as: <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Goyal, Lu, &amp; Lakshmanan, 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kimura &amp; Saito, 2006</ref>). Simpath algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Goyal et al., 2011b</ref>) estimates activation probability of nodes by investigating paths that exists between seed nodes and other nodes in the input network. <ref type="bibr">Kempe et al.</ref> used a greedy algorithm to add K nodes with maximum marginal gain to the seeds set ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kempe et al., 2003)</ref>. Exact calculation of marginal nodes is #P-hard in both IC and LT models <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bakshy et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2010)</ref>. Hence, they are estimated by use of Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Unfortunately, the greedy algorithm has the following drawbacks:</p><p>-MC simulation should be run for many times (e.g. 10,000 times). -This greedy algorithm should use MC for n ? k times.

They supposed that each node can only influence a limited number of its neighbors. So, a local DAG (LDAG) is considered for each node and its influence is investigated for its LDAG. They showed that this heuristic algorithm is faster and even more efficient than its greedy counterparts. However, their idea has the following limitations:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">IC-based influence maximization algorithms</head><p>There exist different solutions for Independent Cascade (IC) model of the problem. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Guo, Zhang, Zhou, Cao, &amp; Guo, 2013)</ref>, the authors present a dynamic selection approach referred to as the Item-based top-k influential user Discovering Approach (IDA). IDA identifies the top-k influential users for a given topic based on real-world diffusion traces and on-line relationships. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kim, Kim, &amp; Yu, 2013)</ref>, the authors propose a scalable influence approximation algorithm named Independent Path Algorithm (IPA). In ( <ref type="bibr">Li et al., 2014</ref>), the polarity-related influence maximization (PRIM) problem is proposed which aims to find the seed node set with maximum positive influence or maximum negative influence in signed social networks. In ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Liu et al., 2013)</ref>, the authors propose GS algorithm for quick approximation of influence spread by solving a linear system, based on the fact that propagation probabilities in real-world social networks are usually quite small. Furthermore, for better approximation, they study the structural defect problem existing in networks, and correspondingly, propose enhanced algorithms, GSbyStep and SSSbyStep, by incorporating the Maximum Influence Path heuristic. In ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Yang et al., 2012)</ref>, the authors propose to measure the seed's independent influence by a linear social influence model. In ( <ref type="bibr">Li et al., 2014</ref>), a novel conformity aware cascade model is proposed which leverages on the interplay between influence and conformity in obtaining the influence probabilities of nodes from underlying data for estimating influence spreads. Also, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ohsaka, Akiba, Yoshida, &amp; Kawarabayashi, 2014)</ref>, the authors propose a new method that produces solutions of high quality base on Monte Carlo simulation. -Finding LDAGs is an NP-hard problem, so a greedy heuristic is employed to discover a good LDAG in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen et al., 2010)</ref>. Using a greedy LDAG may introduce loss in quality of the seed set. -It is supposed that a node can influence others through the paths that exist in its LDAG, so its influence on other paths is ignored. -Storage of all LDAGs needs a huge memory in large networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">LT-based influence maximization algorithms</head><p>In ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Leskovec et al., 2007)</ref>, the authors introduced a sub-modularity factor and presented a lazy-forward greedy algorithm named This algorithm is very efficient for LT model of influence maximization. It is faster than greedy algorithms like CELF but it does not propose high quality starting nodes. Another algorithm is presented in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Leskovec et al., 2007</ref>) that considers another condition for simple greedy algorithms. They presented an optimization for CELF that reduces the number of MC iterations considerably. Despite this optimization, the greedy algorithm needs nearly 700 iterations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Leskovec et al., 2007)</ref>. So, this algorithm is still slow and cannot be used for large graphs ). Generally, LDAG-based algorithms perform better than optimized CELF algorithms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Simpath is also a lazy-forward optimized version of CELF ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Goyal et al., 2011b</ref>). The algorithm inspects all paths from the initial seeds to maximize influence in the LT model. The problem of computing a simple path is #P-hard <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Valiant, 1979)</ref>. Simpath uses the vertex cover method to reduce the number of iterations of the algorithm and the resulted nodes are inspected for influence maximization. In this method, the number of selected nodes is increased after each iteration of the algorithm, so the influence maximization process becomes very slow. Therefore, further optimization is applied to reduce the run time of the iterations.</p><p>More recently, in (Zhou, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhang, Guo, &amp; Guo, 2014)</ref>, the authors derive an upper bound for the spread function under the LT model. They propose an efficient UBLF algorithm by incorporating the bound into CELF. Experimental results demonstrate that UBLF, compared with CELF, reduces Monte Carlo simulations and reduces the execution time when the size of seed set is small. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Narayanam &amp; Narahari, 2010)</ref>, the authors proposed a Shapley value based heuristic SPIN for the LT model. SPIN evaluates the influence spreads of seeds set but it does not use important features of the LT model. CELF and CELF++ algorithms have high execution time, LDAG and High-Degree algorithms could not provide an optimized set of seeds. In contrast to greedy algorithms, the quality of influence spread of Simpath is not optimized in more than 63 percent of its seeds set ( <ref type="bibr">Li et al., 2014</ref>). Hence, we provide a way to select nodes that have both good quality and reduced execution time.</p><p>Also, d X (S) is calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d X ?S? ? X I?S; v; X? ? 2? v2V</formula><p>Where I(S,v,X) is an index function that is equal to 1 if a live path exists between all nodes of S and v, else it is equal to 0.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Community detection algorithms</head><p>In which, Y s,v is the activation probability of node v if S is considered as the starting nodes set that shows the influence weight of S Generally there exist two categories of community detection algorithms: overlapping and non-overlapping. As overlapping community detection is a main part of our proposed algorithm, the related works will be explored in this section briefly. Overlapping community detection algorithms can be divided into five different categories: on v.</p><p>In this model, only directed paths are considered. Let P = hv 1 , v 2 , . . . , v m i be a path and (v i , v j ) 2 P be an edge of the path. The activation probability of a path P is :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Pr?P? ?

Link partitioning algorithms try to divide the input sub-graph into some sub-graphs iteratively in such a way that the final sub-graphs present the graph communities. Local expansion and optimization algorithms work based on extending natural communities or a partial community <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Lancichinetti, Fortunato, &amp; Kertesz, 2009</ref>). Most of these methods focus on a local profit function that tries to find the nodes that are densely connected to each other. Label propagation algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Raghavan, Albert, &amp; Kumara, 2007</ref>) distribute different labels on the input graph based on some predefined roles and finally, the nodes with the same label are considered as a community.</p><p>In this paper, we use SLPA algorithm (Xie, Szymanski, &amp; Liu, 2011) for community detection. SLPA simulates information diffusion process based on listener-speaker interaction. It propagates labels between nodes based on some rules that govern the interaction. In contrast to the methods of in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Raghavan et al. (2007)</ref> and Gregory (2010) they in which a node forgets the information that it received from the previous steps, SLPA considers a memory for each node to store the labels that it receives in different steps of the algorithm. Membership degree of a node is considered as the probability of observing a community label in a node's memory. SLPA is very fast and at the same time it does not need to know the number of communities.</p><p>Finding an optimized path with k members is a NP-Complete problem. So, we should look for a method that provides a good estimation of the solution within an acceptable period of time.</p><p>Let us show sub-graphs with superscripts in the following formulas.

ComPath works based on the following theory in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Goyal et al., 2011b</ref>): Theory 1.

Details of the algorithm will be discussed step by step in the following subsections.</p><p>This step selects k nodes from the output of the previous step in such a way that their activation leads to maximum influence in the input network. In order to find the final set of seed nodes, all paths from each node of the network to the nodes in Selected_Nodes are inspected and the nodes with maximum influence are obtained. First, the path length is considered equal to 2 and seed nodes with maximum influence are selected. Then the path length is increased and the seeds set is calculated again. If average influence of the seed nodes is increased compared to the previous path length, then the path length is increased and the seeds set is calculated again.</p><p>After increasing the path length, some new nodes may be found that are not present in the Selected_Nodes set. So, these nodes are added to a new set v 0 that will be inspected later. The new set's size depends on Selected_Nodes and the chosen path length. So, v' set is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">V 0 ? ?Selected Nodes? [ N out ?Selected Nodes? ? ?

Where V is the set of nodes (communities) and E is the directed edges that exist between the graph nodes. So, a directed edge (A, B) shows that members of the community A are linked to members of B in the original network (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4</ref>).</p><p>Where L is the path length, N out is the set of neighbors of a node that are not present in Selected_Nodes set.

Then influence of all u 2 Selected_Nodes-S i that are present in paths with different length is computed (where S i is the set of selected nodes till the ith step). As an example consider the network of <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> and let S 1 = {x}. In order to find the second node, x is removed from S 1 and if the two remaining nodes are in Selected_Nodes, their influence will be c y,z = 0.2 and c z,y = 0.5.

Each node with maximum influence spread is detected after running the Backtrack function for n times (n = |Selected_Nodes|). Then this node is omitted from the Selected_Nodes set. This process runs for k times to obtain the final seeds set (k = |seeds|).</p></div>

The algorithms are listed in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>:</p><p>At first, the optimum number of chosen communities and candidate nodes that are selected from each of them should be identified. For this purpose different experiments are carried out. More than 2800 communities are identified for NetHEPT by SLPA algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Xie et al., 2011</ref>). The number of candidate nodes from each community depends on the number of selected communities and the number of nodes in each community. <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> shows the number of communities and the number of nodes selected from 255 communities with maximum betweenness centrality in the network. We need to select 50 nodes as the final seeds set. As the figure shows, 12 nodes are selected from the community with highest betweenness centrality measure.</p><p>Also, the number of communities and size of Selected_Nodes in NetHEPT and Epinion are shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> and 4 respectively. As <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows, if 5, 50 or 100 seeds are needed, only 39, 437, 870 nodes are inspected in the proposed algorithm while the total number of nodes of the network is 15233.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="20000">18000</head><p>In this research, an efficient algorithm, named ComPath, was proposed based on the linear model to find top-k most influential people in social networks. Our experiments showed the algorithm provides a good balance between execution time and efficiency. The algorithm detects the communities of the input network at first and investigates a limited number of them to reduce the execution time. Also, ComPath is able to suggest a limited number of communities to be investigated from the input network. This is very useful in our real world because it enables us to choose a few number of communities as our target and reduce the expenses for different applications such as product advertisement, etc.</p><p>As mentioned before, for computing the influence spread of nodes in the linear threshold model, the formula d?v?  In this research, we introduced two modifications to this formula. The first one was to limit the number of nodes that are examined that is accomplished by using the centrality measures, community detection and computing the Selected_Nodes set. The second one was to limit the search space of the input graph in the set v'. The size of v' depends on the Selected_Nodes set and the chosen path length. Finally, the formula used in this paper is:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CELF++</head><p>647.267 15435.7  threshold, the edge between them is ignored by the algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of Seeds</head><p>Determining an optimized value of g may be very hard for many graphs. On the other hand, our proposed algorithm uses a path length parameter that can be easily estimated in real world networks (the optimized path length value is 3, 4 or 5 for most graphs). Our experimental evaluation of ComPath showed that by computing each node's influence on its neighbors with a path length less than 5, most influential nodes of the network can be identified by the algorithm. Also, the proposed algorithm only requires to obtain the number of nodes in the Selected_Nodes set with maximum value of d(x), therefore the algorithm requires to execute the Backtrack function for j-i times where j is equal to the number of nodes in the Selected_Nodes set, and i is the cardinality of the Seed set. This fact helps to reduce the number of inspected nodes and so the proposed algorithm runs much faster than the other algorithms (See <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Tables 6 and 7)</ref>. Another benefit of the proposed algorithm, compared to other algorithms like UBLF ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhou et al., 2014</ref>) and Simpath ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Goyal et al., 2011b</ref>) is that it identifies the most influential communities of the network. In many occasions it is highly desirable to focus on a small sub-graph that can maximize the influence spread all over the input graph. For example, let us consider the problem of advertising a product in a social network. In our real world it is very hard to start advertising from some people that are distributed all over the network. So, advertisement companies try to focus on a community (or communities) that can maximize their advertisement effectiveness. They would like to know which communities (and which people in each community) are better to be considered as their advertisement target. The proposed algorithm can also provide a good answer for this kind of influence maximization problem.</p><p>As the experimental results showed, the mentioned modifications improved the execution time and the information spread.</p><p>Several challenges and future directions remain to investigate: one of them would be to use other centrality measures such as PageRank or K-Center to calculate the member of the Selected_Nodes set. Another challenge would be to use different algorithms for detecting communities and to investigate the parameters that affect the community detection algorithms. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
