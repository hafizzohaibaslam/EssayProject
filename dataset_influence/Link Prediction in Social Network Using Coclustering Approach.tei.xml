				<p>This paper introduces an approach to derive whether an individual is related to an item or not. In our approach, the well-known DBLP dataset is used and we try to find some skills that are related to an author that we were not aware of before. To realize our objective, we cluster authors and skills using Spectral Graph Clustering algorithm, then simultaneously obtain author and skill clusters via Bipartite Graph (Bigraph) Spectral Co-clustering approach, and then generate predictions based on the outputs of clustering and co-clustering steps. Accordingly, we utilize clustering and co-clustering advantages to predict the probability of link existing between an author and a skill. Experimental results on DBLP dataset show that our approach works well in the specified task. s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 s 5 s 6 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9 Figure 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The main objective of this paper is to pinpoint whether a given author has a predefined skill or not in social network field. This realm deserve conducting considerable research due to its wide varieties of applications in collaborative filtering, information retrieval and other approaches as link prediction problem. Be noted that, the relationship between authors and skills can be represented as a bigraph, which means a graph who have two disjoint part with some links between their nodes as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. Whereas it is possible to represent authors (skills) as nodes of a graph, we used Spectral Graph Clustering algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> to perform clustering. This method is a powerful technique that has many advantages such as capability of implementing efficiently for large data sets even with a sparse graph. Consequently, the author-skill bigraph is reduced to containing author and skill clusters as its nodes. After clustering step, we perform co-clustering on author cluster-skill cluster bigraph which is faster than authorskill bigraph co-clustering and impart more precision since the partitions are made using pre-formed clusters .</p><p>As experimental results on a subset of DBLP dataset show, this approach outperforms some other approaches applying RMSE metric. The overall design of proposed algorithm is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.  2</ref>. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section2 describes Spectral graph clustering and Bigraph Spectral Co-clustering algorithms. Section 3 introduces a model to calculate link existence probability. Section 4 presents the experimental study. Section5 concludes the paper and finally section 6 points future directions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RELATED WORKS</head><p>Link prediction has recently been studied in a wide range of problems such as collaborative filtering recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> (predicting user-item links based on a user-item interaction matrix), information retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> (predicting query-document links based on a documentword network), record linkage problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> (predicting links among records with same identity), social network <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> (predicting author-author links). To solve this problem, various methods were introduced including Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>, Relational Markov Networks (RMNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>, logistic regression model <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> or other supervised learning algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. Approximately, all link prediction methods are defined on unipartite graphs, and applying these approaches on bipartite graphs will not work well. Although, In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> an The top layer is author space, bottom is skill space and the middle is their cluster space. algebraic function is performed on a bipartite graph to identify link existence probability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III.</head><p>ENRICHED <ref type="bibr">CO-CLUSTERING</ref> In this section we present main part of our approach. The objective is simultaneously obtain reviewer and skill neighborhoods so that predictions can be applied based on the accessed results. At first, clustering algorithm is performed on authors and skills separately to reduce data dimensions in the co-clustering process. To do this, Spectral Graph Clustering algorithm is applied. Then Bigraph Spectral Co-clustering algorithm is used to cocluster formed author and skills clusters. The overall design of these section is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Spectral Graph Clustering</head><p>Spectral Graph Clustering Algorithm is used to put similar authors or items together and so to increase our information approximately. In practice, after preprocessing DBLP dataset, we formed author-skill bigraph G p¡Áq -with p (q) showing the number of authors (skills)-where edge weight between author a and skill s is published by a, and ? ? is the number of papers published by a containing s. Please note that skill s can be simply extracted from paper title. As experimental results show, because of sparsity and potentially huge size of graph, performing co-clustering algorithm on this bipartite graph without pre-clustering is not recommended. So, we formed two symmetric similarity matrix A and S between pair-wise authors and pair-wise skills using Jaccard measure as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">? ?,? = ?? ? ?? ? ? |? ? ?? ? | ?? ? ?? ? ? ??? ?,? = |? ? ?? ? | (1)</formula><p>where P i (P j ) is the set of papers are published by i (j) and R m (R n ) is the set of authors having skill m (n). It is obvious that A and S indicate undirected graphs with weighted edges between nodes; So using the known Spectral Graph Clustering algorithm, we can find similar authors (or skills) and form some clusters. The spectral graph clustering algorithm, partitions a graph, keeping maximum within-cluster similarity meanwhile the between-cluster similarity is minimized. As a result, the following equation should be maximized:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">¡Æ ¡Æ ??? ?,? ?,?? ? ? ? ??? (2) calculated as ??? ?,??? = ? ??? ©¦? ? ©¦</formula><p>, where ? ? is the set of papers Where, ? is the number of clusters, ??? ? is ?'th cluster and ??? ?,? is edge weight between nodes i and j. Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">(2)</ref> is maximized if ??,?(??? ??? ? ) is small and ?)?(???? is large. Where ??? ? is all clusters except ??? and:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">??,?(??? ??? ? ) = ¡Æ ??? ?,? ???,??? ? , ?)?(???? = ¡Æ ??? ?,? ?,? ? ? (3)</formula><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3</ref>(a), a graph is clustered using the mentioned optimization formula. To get optimized clusters, this algorithm is based on eigenvectors of Laplacians, which are a combination of the weight and the degree matrix. For broader discussion of mathematical properties of Laplacians refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">? ?,? = ? deg(?) ?? ? = ? 0 ????????????? a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6</formula><p>The corresponding pseudocode of this algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1. where A and S are sets of authors and skills respectively. Also, ?,?(?? ?)?? is defined as: </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">?,?(?? ?)?? = ? ??? ?,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">??(?? (?) ? , ??? (?) ? ) = ¡Æ ¡Æ ?,?(?? ?)?? ??(??? ??? ? (?) ) ??(??? ??? ? (?) ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Here, the co-clustering algorithm is performed to reveal the correlations between author clusters and skill clusters. Ideally we need an algorithm to partition the bigraph and get global optimum solution , like in clustering, it means keeping minimum sum of link weights between coclusters meanwhile the sum of links within co-clusters are maximized. There are some well known co-clustering algorithms, for instance, Information Theoretic Co-clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, Bayesian Co-clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, Bigraph Spectral Coclustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. Here, we adapt Bigraph Spectral Co-clustering algorithm to our approach that works based on singular vectors and results global optimum partitioning. As Spectral Graph Clustering, Bigraph Spectral Coclustering algorithm searches for the best cut to minimize the sum of edge weights between clusters, in addition to form balanced partitions (with similar vol). The best cut for clustering a bigraph is drawn in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3(b)</ref>. Suppose that the adjacency matrix A of bigraph G c is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(?) (?) (?) (?) ??? ?,? = ? ??? ?,? ?? ????????? ???????? ???? {?, ?} 0 ????????????? ??,?(??? ?)?? = ??,?(??? ??? ? ) ???(??? ? , ??? ? ) ??,?(??? ??? ? )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Here, ??? (?) ? (resp. ??? <ref type="bibr">(?)</ref> where ??? ?,? is the edge weight between i and j. Also, two diagonal matrix ??? ? and ??? ? are used here so that ? ) corresponds to co-cluster ? ? (resp. ? ? ). And also we have the following equation: According to this correlation propagation chain, we construct the probability model as follows:</p><p>The pseudocode that corresponds to these algorithm is shown in Algorithm 2. </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">?(? ? ?)?? = ?(??? (?) ? ©¦?) ?(??? (?) ? ©¦??? (?) ? ) ?(??©¦?? (?) ? )<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">?(? ? ?)?? = ?(? ? ©¦??? (?) ? ) ?(? ? ©¦? ? ) ?(??? (?) ? ©¦? ? )<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">?? ? ? ? = ? ??? ? ? ??? ? ?? ? ? ? ?</formula><p>The three probabilities in Equation (6) are calculated similarly, here is one of them where O is set of all coclusters:</p><p>3: Run the k-means algorithm on the ?-dimensional data Z to obtain the desired k-way multipartitioning. output: k co-clusters.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">(?) ?(? ? ©¦??? (?) ? ) = ???(? ? ,? ? ) ¡Æ ???(? ? ,? (?) (9) ? ) ? ? ??</formula><p>As you can see in pseudocode, SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) based property of this algorithm, make it difficult to use for large adjacency matrices. So, performing pre-clustering, is a solution to overcome this problem. Like Spectral Graph Clustering algorithm, this algorithm is also sensitive to parameter k. After running the algorithm, author and skill clusters, partition into a set of co-clusters. It is clear that authors and skills in the same co-cluster may have relatively strong correlation. So, there is a high probability that an author may have a skill in the same co-cluster. Although, author clusters and skill clusters in different co-clusters may also have some relationship between them. In next section we explain an approach for calculating this probability.</p><p>In our approach cor function is calculated using Euclidean similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> between vectors in l-dimension space, where Z contains the vectors of clusters that are mapped in l-dimension space, and for each co-cluster we use the mean vector from its members. Finally, we increase the calculation precision by using two summation in Equation (6), so, </p><formula xml:id="formula_11">?(? ? ?)?? = ¡Æ ¡Æ ?(? ? ©¦??? (?) ? ) ?(? ? ©¦? ? ) ?(??? (?) ? ©¦? ? ) ? ? ?? ? ? ??<label>(</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. PREDICTION MODEL</head><p>own co-clusters respectively, the first and third probability in this Equation, are constant values (like Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(5)</ref>). Accordingly, because it may exist some similarity between each clusters and other co-clusters we use Equation (10). Finally, using mentioned Equations, results the relationship probability value between an author and a skill here.</p><p>This section pertain to construct a model for predicting whether an author a is related to skill s or not. The model we use for this task, is stated as calculating the link existence probability between a and s similar to existence uncertainty of PRMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. We define the correlation between a and s as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">V.</formula><p>EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</p><p>This section provides empirical evidence to demonstrate that, how proposed algorithm, improves the link prediction accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Dataset</head><p>In the experiments, We use a snapshot of the DBLP 1 data taken on April 12, 2006 to create a benchmark dataset. We use a subset of this dataset containing some papers published in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science areas, So we extract about 40,000 authors and more than 1,000,000 links between pair-wise of them. In order to form the skill set, we used the title of papers and after pre-processing, extracted about 12,000 distinct skills.</p><p>Where C is the cluster of a, sim(a,i) is similarity value between a and i calculated using Jaccard measure as in section 2.1, and w i,s is the weight of link between i and s.</p><p>3) Without clustering: Calculate prob a,s applying weighted sum formula mentioned above using summation over all authors.</p><p>As shown in Table2, our method performs better than these three approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Evaluation measure</head><p>To evaluate the prediction results, the root mean squared error (RMSE) is used, as follows: where, V is test set as |V|=n, v r is real value of v'th link weight and v p is the predicted value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Observation analysis</head><p>As mentioned before, the proposed approach is sensitive to the number of author and skill clusters and coclusters. So, we compared RMSE for different values of author clusters and co-clusters, using constant value 500 as the number of skill clusters .</p><p>The considerable difference between our approach and others is because of performing clustering in three steps here, so that it finds similarities better than other rival approaches. As shown in Table1, the best RMSE is obtained by k=700 and C=20. Here, we compare our approach with Three algorithms defined below: 1) Co-clustering: Apply Bigraph Spectral Co-clustering algorithm without invoking clustering as pre-processing algorithm.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>2) Author clustering: Cluster authors with Spectral graph clustering algorithm and calculate link existence probability between a and s using weighted sum formula as:</p><p>The objective of proposed method, is to predict the probability of having a skill for a given author. In the other words, we want to know whether an author is related to a skill. To form our dataset, we extracted a subset of DBLP containing about 40,000 distinct authors and 12,000 skills. Using information in dataset, the author-author and skillskill graphs and author-skill bigraph are made while these are represented as matrices. To reach our objective, we introduced a co-clustering based approach which includes four steps as, clustering author-author and skill-skill graphs separately, co-clustering the formed clusters and building a prediction model. Using clustering prior to co-clustering, improves our method against some other clustering based methods as we have shown in experimental results section in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> using RMSE evaluation metric. Another advantage of this proposed method is that it can overcome the sparsity and huge size of datasets efficiently which most of the datasets suffer from these problems. finally, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to search for a probabilistic value that relates an author to a skill in social network field . The main co-clustering property is simultaneously clustering two related sets, so that in each co-cluster, similar items from two sets are placed. Accordingly, We decide to use this property in TEAM FORMATION problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> as a future work. There is a task containing some skills and the objective is choosing a number of related authors to perform this task efficiently.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3.
