				<p>Keywords Previous research has suggested that people who are in the same social circle exhibit similar behaviors and tastes. The rise of social networks gives us insights into the social circles of web users, and recommendation services (including search engines, advertisement engines, and collaborative filtering engines) provide a motivation to adapt recommendations to the interests of the audience. An important primitive for supporting these applications is the ability to quantify how connected two users are in a social network. The shortest-path distance between a pair of users is an obvious candidate measure. This paper introduces a new measure of &quot;affinity&quot; in social networks that takes into account not only the distance between two users, but also the number of edge-disjoint paths between them, i.e. the &quot;robustness&quot; of their connection. Our measure is based on a sketch-based approach, and affinity queries can be answered extremely efficiently (at the expense of a one-time offline sketch computation). We compare this affinity measure against the &quot;approximate shortest-path distance&quot;, a sketch-based distance measure with similar efficiency characteristics. Our empirical study is based on a Hotmail email exchange graph combined with demographic information and Bing query history , and a Twitter mention-graph together with the text of the underlying tweets. We found that users who are close to each other-either in terms of distance or affinity-have a higher similarity in terms of demographics, queries, and tweets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Affinity based distance measure</head><p>The affinity measure introduced in this paper is essentially a quantification of the probability that a given pair of nodes remain connected when a certain fraction of the edges are removed randomly. For example, if 50% of the edges are removed randomly, then it is reasonable to conclude that pairs of nodes remaining in the same connected component have a higher affinity than the ones that got separated. If there is only one path of a certain length between a pair it is less likely to survive sampling as compared to a case when there are many paths of that length. Also, longer paths are less likely to survive than shorter paths. Thus, our measure accounts for both length and breadth of the set of paths. We formalize this intuition below.</p><p>Given a graph G, let Gp denote the graph obtained by sampling the edges of the graph with probability p (so G1 = G). The affinity, parameterized by p, between a pair of nodes is defined as follows Definition 1. Ap(u, v) = probability that u and v are connected in Gp.</p></div>

For each value of probability we can sample the edges of the graph and record the connected component of each node (e.g. the ID of a canonical "representative" node in the connected component). We repeat this for all probabilities, a few times for each value. The sketch C(u) is simply the vector (or matrix) of component IDs for this node u over all these sampling experiments.</p><p>At runtime, to estimate A ¦È (u, v) we retrieve C(u) and C(v). For each sampling probability find the fraction of times they were in the same component.

A ¦È (u, v) is concentrated between p and p ¡ä . Now, let us give a formal definition of an affinity sketch.

In order to describe how sketches are used to estimate the affinity between two vertices, we employ Iverson bracket notation: [a = b] is 1 if a = b and 0 otherwise, and <ref type="bibr">[a &lt; b]</ref> is 1 if a &lt; b and 0 otherwise. Using this notation, we define the affinity estimates?Aestimates? estimates?A and?Aand? and?A ¦È of two vertices v and v ¡ä with sketch matrices C and C ¡ä to be as follows:</p><p>We built single-machine implementations of both the offline and the on-line phase of the affinity sketch algorithm. The off-line phase consists of several steps: First, we map user IDs into a dense integer space suitable as array indices. Second, we load the edge set of the graph into an in-memory array and permute this array, either uniformly at random or biased by the weight of each edge. Third, we perform q iterations, each computing one row of the sketch matrix C(v) for each vertex v. Each iteration starts with an empty edge set, and consumes the content of the permuted edge array in order, adding each new edge to a union-find forest. Whenever a sampling threshold as specified by the vector p1, ¡¤ ¡¤ ¡¤ , pr is crossed, we write the connected-component ID of each node v (which corresponds to a cell ci,j in C(v)) to disk, eventually producing q ¡Á r streams of connected component IDs. Fourth, we merge these q ¡Á r streams into a single stream of sketches, each sketch being a matrix of q ¡Á r component IDs. The online phase, given a pair of user IDs, simply converts them into two integers using the same mapping as the off-line phase, and uses each integer to seek to the right position of the sketch file and to read the sketch from disk. </p></div>

Similarly we can argue that if p ¡Ü h(1 ? ?) then the observed fraction will be less than ¦È. Therefore our sampling probability vector will contain two probability values that sandwich h within a 1 ¡À O(?) factor. By appropriately adjusting the constants in the O(.) notation, we get the theorem statement.</p><p>In Section 3, we will compare the effectiveness of the affinity measure to that of the approximate shortest path measure, another sketch-based measure of distances in graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The ASP measure is a variant of the algorithm introduced by Thorup and Zwick <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>The idea behind the approximate shortest path (ASP) algorithm is to sample, in the off-line phase, a small number of sets of "seed" nodes in the graph. Then, for each node in the graph, find the closest seed node in each of these seed sets. The sketch for a node simply consists of the closest seeds (one per seed set), and the distance to each closest seed. Then, in the online computation, one can use the distance to these closest seeds to estimate the distance between a given pair of nodes by checking for a common seed between the two sketches. Given a pair of nodes u and v one can estimate the distance between them by looking for a common seed in their sketches. If w is a common seed in the sketch of u and v then the distance can be estimated by adding up the distances to the common seed w.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">EXPERIMENTS</head><p>We performed two studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the Affinity measure and to compare it to ASP distance. The first study was conducted on the Hotmail email exchange graph, and used user-supplied demographic information as well as Bing query history as its ground truth; the second study was conducted on the Twitter mention-graph, and used the text of tweets as its ground truth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The Hotmail experiment</head><p>Our first experiment is based on three data sets:</p><p>1. An anonymized data set containing a pair of user ID hashes for any two email users (at least one of which is a Hotmail user) that had a mutual email exchange (that is, both users sent email to one another). This data set induces a graph with 312,548,443 nodes and 574,434,516 undirected edges, implying an average de-  3.

This left us with a set of 10,974,103 "candidate" users. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows the distribution of the top twenty countries of residence of Hotmail users (the top twenty countries being those with at least 1% of users in the overall data set). The horizontal axis shows the country, ordered by decreasing frequency in the overall data set; the vertical axis shows the percentage of users from a given country. The blue curve plots the distribution of the 151 million users for whom we have demographic information; the green curve shows the distribution of the 32 million users for which we also have queries; and the red curve shows the distribution of the 11 million "candidate" users from which we sampled pairs. While the largest portion of Hotmail users resides in the United States, a surprisingly large portion resides in Latin America (Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, Venezuela, Peru, and Chile). It is also worth noting that users from the US are overrepresented in the users-with-queries set relative to their representation in the overall data set. This is due the fact that Bing is particularly popular in the US. Users from the US and Mexico yet more overrepresented in the candidate set, suggesting that they either issue more queries or maintain a larger set of email partners. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the distribution of the top ten primary languages of Hotmail users (the top ten languages being those with at least 1% of users in the overall data set), using the same encoding as the previous <ref type="figure">figure.</ref> The largest portion of users in the overall set are Spanish-speakers (consistent with the popularity of Hotmail in Latin America and Spain), while the users-with-queries and candidate sets are dominated by English-speakers. We attribute this to the overrepresentation of US users in the candidate set. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the distribution of (self-declared) ages of Hotmail users, using the same encoding as the previous two figures. The graph shows only ages from 10 to 90 years, which accounts for 98.4% of the overall user base. The overall user base is dominated by people in their early twenties, users in the users-with-queries and candidate sets are slightly older. Notice the peaks at ages that are a multiple of ten, and minor peaks at multiples of five, which suggests that users round their ages before reporting.</p><p>We used the implementation described in section 2.4 to compute sketches for each node in the email exchange graph, using a machine with a dual-core AMD Opteron 285 processor clocked at 2.6 GHz, 16 GB of RAM, and a RAID-5 array composed of eight 1 TB, 7200 RPM Seagate Barracuda SATA drives. We set q to 10 and r to 100, yielding sketches of 4000 bytes per node. We computed three sets of sketches: one where edges were permuted uniformly at random, one where edges were permuted biased by their weight (the count of email exchanges), and one where edges were permuted biased by the log of their weight. The computation took 14 days. Most of the time was spent on disk I/O; indeed, the final merge phase (which merged a thousand files into a single 1.13 TB file) took 11 days. We also ran a variant of this program that performs the same computation, but records statistics instead of writing out sketches. Running this variant over the same input data took slightly less than 22 hours.</p><p>Instead of choosing a geometric progression for the sampling probability vector p1, ¡¤ ¡¤ ¡¤ , pr as suggested in in Theorem 7, we calibrated it such that the affinity value between a random pair of nodes is uniformly distributed in the range <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref>.</p><p>We randomly sampled 5 million pairs of users from the set of 10,974,103 candidate users, and computed the ASP distances and affinities between each pair. Using the hardware described above and the 1.13 TB sketch file produced by the off-line phase, computing the affinity value for each pair of Hotmail user IDs takes about 17 milliseconds; this time is dominated by the cost of performing two disk seeks.  <ref type="formula">8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24</ref>     <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Correlation coefficient between similarity of pairs of users and their proximity in the email exchange graph. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the distribution of ASP distances. The mode of the distribution is at distance 10, and the bulk is between 5 and 15. It should be pointed out that in earlier work we found ASP to overestimate distance by a constant additive amount (about 2 to 3 in the case of undirected web graphs), so we assume the distribution of true distances to be shifted accordingly. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows the distribution of A ¦È affinity values (for ¦È = 0.5) of the sketches for the graph with unweighted edges. The mode of the distribution is at 0.82. Given that the sampling probability vector p1, ¡¤ ¡¤ ¡¤ , pr was calibrated to produce a uniform distribution of affinity values across the entire set of 312 million users in the email exchange graph, the non-uniformity of the distribution in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> indicates that our set of candidate users is biased towards users with affinity towards each other. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows the fraction of pairs of users (drawn from the candidate set) residing in the same country, as a function of the distance and affinity between the pair of users. The vertical axis shows the fraction of pairs coming from the same country; the bottom scale of the horizontal axis shows ASP distance values (in increasing order) whose distribution is plotted by the blue curve; the top scale shows the estimated A ¦È affinity values (in decreasing order, for ¦È = 0.5 and based on the sketches formed using unweighted edges) whose distribution is plotted by the red curve. Each (x, y) point of a curve shows the fraction y of all pairs at distance/affinity x who reside in the same country. In order to reduce noise, we restricted the curves to only those distance and affinity values with at least 1000 (out of 5 million) pairs of users. Both distance and affinity measures are discrete, but since the set of possible distance values is smaller than the set of possible affinity values, the affinity curve appears smoother. The ASP curve is far more slanted than the affinity curve, suggesting that the correlation between ASP and country of residence is far stronger than between affinity and country. Indeed, this is borne out by the correlation coefficients shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows the fraction of pairs of users speaking the same language, using the same encoding as the previous figure. Again, we restricted the curve to points with at least 1000 pairs of users. As in the previous figure, the ASP curve is far more slanted than the affinity curve, suggesting stronger correlation between distance and language than between affinity and language. This is also borne out by the correlation coefficients in the second row of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows the age difference between pairs of users as a function of the distance and affinity between the pair of users. The vertical axis plots the age difference, the horizontal axis plots distance and affinity as it did in Figures 6 and 7. Each (x, y) point of a curve shows the average age difference y of all pairs at distance/affinity x. Again, the curve only shows points with at least 1000 pairs of users so as to reduce noise. The graph has several features worth pointing out: First, note that the vertical axis does not start at 0, but rather at 14 years -the average age difference between pairs of users is ranges between about 15 and 18 years regardless of distance or affinity. Putting it differently, email is a social medium that connects generations. Second, age difference and affinity are negatively correlated -users with high affinity are on average closer in age. Third, the distance curve is non-monotonic -there is no clear relationship between the ASP distance of two users in the email graph and their age difference. Referring to the third row of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, the correlation coefficients of ASP distance and age vs. affinity and age are quite low and fairly close to each other, with ASP having a slight edge.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>800,000</head><p>The previous three figures examined the connection between two users' demographic background (namely country, language and age) and their distance and affinity in the email exchange graph. Next, we examine whether the distance or affinity between two users is predictive of shared interests.</p><p>To that end, we aggregate all the queries issued by a given user into a bag of terms, and we weigh each term in the bag by its tf-idf value <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. We compute the cosine similarity between the tf-idf weighted queries for each of the 5 million pairs of users, and we treat this similarity as a proxy of the similarity of their interests. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> depicts the results of this experiment. The vertical axis plots the similarity between a pair's queries, the horizontal axis plots distance and affinity as it did in the previous three figures. Each (x, y) point of a curve shows the average similarity y of all pairs at distance/affinity x. As in <ref type="figure">Figures 6 and 7</ref>, the ASP curve is more slanted than the affinity curve, suggesting stronger correlation between distance and query similarity than between affinity and query similarity. This is also borne out by the correlation coefficients in the fourth row of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the correlation coefficient between user demographic and interest profiles and the different types of social proximity measures we are considering in this study. In addition to the approximate shortest path distance, we are considering six different variants of the affinity measure: A ¦È (for ¦È = 0.5) and A, computed on the email exchange graph with unweighted edges, edges weighted (and sampled) by the number of reciprocal email exchanges, and edges weighted by the logarithm of that number. Consistent with <ref type="figure">Figures 6-9</ref>, we find that the correlation coefficients of the ASP measure are higher than those of A ¦È and A for all user characteristics. The weighted versions of affinity also have a higher correlation than the unweighted ones for all characteristics except age. This might indicate that age changes differently over the network than language or country. Language and country probably change over long distances, whereas age per-  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Statistical significance of the correlations: Ratio of correlation for the same pair to correlation for random pairs.</p><p>haps changes more quickly; that is, the ball around a point with similar age is probably smaller than the ball around a point with the same language or country. This could be an indication that the unweighted variants of affinity are better measures to capture "small" social distances whereas ASP is better for "large" social distances. This is consistent with our earlier observation that ASP has a higher percentage error on shorter distances <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>It is an open question of how well precise shortest-path distance would perform; unfortunately we do not know how to perform five million precise shortest-path computations within a reasonable time frame.</p><p>While it may seem that the correlation coefficients in Table 1 are small, we show that they are much higher than the values we would expect if the properties were completely uncorrelated. In <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, we compare the correlation coefficients computed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> to the correlation coefficients between the same properties for two independently chosen sequences of 5 million pairs. For example, to compute the correlation coefficient between affinity and cosine similarity (CA,cs), we computed it between the vector of cosine similarities and affinities on the same set of 5 million pairs. Now we compute it between the vector of cosine similarities for one random set of pairs and vector of affinities for another random set of pairs (C r A,cs ). We compute the ratio |CA,cs|/|C r A,cs |. If this ratio is high it means that the values of affinity and cosine similarities for the same pair are much more correlated than for two random pairs. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows this ratio for the different pairs of properties. As can be seen, the ratio is about 7 to 16 for the affinity variants and about 13 to 80 for the ASP measure, which means that the statistical significance of the correlations is not negligible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The Twitter experiment</head><p>Our second experiment is based on one month worth of Twitter postings (tweets), 1,475,522,405 in total. Twitter is a popular micro-blogging service that allows users to post messages up to 140 characters in length. The Twitter community follows a number of stylistic conventions when composing tweets, one of them the convention of mentioning other Twitter users by prefixing their Twitter user IDs with the @ character. A single mention in itself does not indicate a social connection between the mentioner and the mentioned, but we assert that if two users mutually mention each other, a social bond does indeed exist.</p><p>We first ran an initial data extraction process on our collection of tweets that identified all pairs of (distinct) users mutually mentioning each other at least once during August 2011, and extracted all tweets (whether containing mentions or not) authored by these users. This extracted 1,265,660,845 tweets authored by 10,410,144 users.</p><p>Next, we constructed the mention-graph using the following process: First, we constructed an intermediate weighted directed graph containing a vertex for each user whose tweets we extracted during the data extraction phase, and an edge (u, v) with weight w if user u mentioning user v a total of w times. Next, we constructed the actual mention graph, an undirected weighted graph, by taking the vertex set of the directed graph, and introducing an edge between u and v with weight mean(w1, w2) if the directed graph contained an edge (u, v) with positive weight w1 and an edge (v, u) with positive weight w2. We constructed one variant of the mention graph using the arithmetic mean of weights, and another variant using the geometric mean. The mention-graph contained 10,410,144 vertices and 176,551,621 edges.</p><p>As in the previous experiment, we drew a random sample of 5 million pairs of users, and computed affinity values and ASP distances between each pair of users in the mention graph. We also computed the cosine similarity between the tf-idf vectors of the collected tweets of each pair of users, and we computed correlation coefficients between the graphbased measures and the text-based ground truth. 880,564 of the 5,000,000 pairs (or 17.6% of all sampled pairs) were in separate connected components of the mention-graph, with no path between them. These pairs have an affinity value of 0 and an ASP distance of ¡Þ.</p><p>In computing affinity values and ASP distances, we experimented with different transform functions for edge weights. In the case of affinity, where heavier edges are more likely to be included in Gp and thus denote closeness, we tried the constant transform T (w) = 1 (effectively ignoring weights), the identity transform T (w) = w (directly using the mean of the mention frequency), and the logarithmic transform T (w) = log w (discounting excessive "mutual admiration"). In the case of ASP distance, where edge weight denote social distance, we tried the constant transform T (w) = 1 (effectively ignoring weights), the reciprocal transform T (w) = 1 w , and the reciprocal logarithmic transform T (w) = 1 log w . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref> shows the distribution of ASP distances computed using the constant edge weight transform (i.e. an unweighted graph); <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref> shows the distribution of A ¦È affinity values (for ¦È = 0.5) of the sketches for the graph with unweighted edges. In both figures, we do not show the 880,564 disconnected pairs of users in the sample. The mode of the ASP distance distribution is at distance 9, and the bulk is between 6 and 12. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref> is the analogous version of <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> for the Twitter mention graph. We compute the cosine similarity between the tf-idf weighted tweets of each of the 5 million pairs of users, and we treat this similarity as a proxy of the similarity of their interests. The vertical axis plots the similarity between a pair's queries, the horizontal axis plots distance  ? In the context of the affinity measures, combining edge weights using their arithmetic mean is slightly better than using their geometric mean. and affinity. Each (x, y) point of a curve shows the average similarity y of all pairs at distance/affinity x. Unlike what we observed for the Hotmail graph, the affinity curve is more slanted than the ASP curve, suggesting stronger correlation between affinity and tweet similarity than between distance and tweet similarity. This is also borne out by the correlation coefficients in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. The table shows correlation coefficients between textual cosine similarity (our ground truth) and different variants of our graph-distance measures. Specifically, it explores the impact of using an arithmetic vs. a geometric mean when combining edge weights during the mapping from a directed to an undirected graph; the impact of multiple edge weight transforms; and of course the distance measure itself -negated ASP distance, A ¦È affinity, and A affinity. We can draw several conclusions from the data presented in this table:</p><p>? The A affinity measure performs slightly better than the A ¦È affinity measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CONCLUSION</head><p>? Similarity is much more highly correlated to affinity than to ASP distance.</p><p>? For affinity measures, the identity transform performs slightly better than the other transforms.</p><p>In this paper, we introduced "social affinity" as a new measure of how robustly two users are connected within a social network. Intuitively, affinity captures how robust the connection between a pair of users is to random deletion of edges in the graph. The affinity value can be efficiently estimated through a sketch-based algorithm, which requires only two table lookups to retrieve the sketch for each user, plus a simple computation on the pair of sketches. We compare this new affinity measure against "approximate shortest path" distance, another sketch-based measure estimating the shortest-path distance between two nodes in a graph. We evaluated our measure on two social graphs. First, we used a sampling of the Hotmail email exchange graph as our social network, and user profiles and query history as independent measures of user similarity. We found that both ASP distance and social affinity between two users are correlated to their profile and query similarity. While ASP had a higher correlation for most user properties, affinity was better in one that changes over short distances. This suggests that the affinity measure may be better-suited for capturing short-distance effects in a social graph, whereas ASP may be preferable for capturing long-distance effects. Second, we constructed a Twitter mention graph from one month worth of tweets, and the collection of tweets written by a given user as the ground truth. We found that the textual similarity between two users' tweets was strongly correlated to their affinity, and somewhat more weakly correlated to their approximate distance in the mention-graph.</p><p>We hypothesize that some of the weaknesses we observed for ASP are due to the fact that ASP is an approximation of the true distance. We are still investigating whether it is reasonably feasible to compute precise shortest path distances for the five million pairs we used to compare our measures.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Country distribution of Hotmail users Figure 2: Language distribution of Hotmail users Figure 3: Age distribution of Hotmail users</figDesc></figure>
