			<abstract>
				<p>The rapid adoption of online social networks (OSN) across different stakeholders raises several interesting questions on different facets of its dynamics. Properly governed and designed OSN can play an important role in supporting different types of decision making (DM), as they provide their participants/stakeholders various forms of support, ranging from the instrumental to the emotional and informational. The synergy of these themes provides an innovative and unique perspective on the actual process of DM within OSN. We use online survey method to address the potential utilization of OSN as a support tool for the DM process. Our results indicate that OSN support and empower users in their decision making process specifically in three key phases that include Intelligence, Design and Choice. Our results also reveal that different types of users (observers, seekers and advisers) have significantly different participation styles, which in turn have an impact on the efficacy of the DM process. We discuss policy implications for OSN designers based on results from this study.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The history of decision making (DM) research is long, rich and diverse. In terms of quantity, there is no shortage of frameworks, taxonomies, approaches and theories. Decision making is a complex field; it can involve the adoption of various technologies, in addition to the accommodation for different psychological perspectives of individuals. Over the years, the DM process has been extensively studied by researchers. These studies have resulted in several dominant DM perspectives.</p><p>Before computer-mediated communication (CMC), people met and communicated with one another via face-to-face interactions. This was achieved by making social connections within different types of networks. A social network (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">31]</ref>) is a social structure that consists of individuals who are interconnected with one another through common interests, beliefs and/or values. For an excellent introduction to social networks, the interested reader is referred to Wasserman and Faust <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[29]</ref>. From the mid-nineties, social network research has evolved to include online social networks. The idea of building a community based upon a common interest is of great interest within social network research, with online social networks (OSN) as the primary focus. Researchers in this general area are interested in understanding and learning about OSN: How are they used, and how do they affect our societies and businesses? Given their varied nature, OSN are multifaceted, and researchers have explored various such facets over the past several years. We study DM in OSN.</p><p>It is generally acknowledged that DM process comprises several phases (e.g., intelligence, design, choice, implementation, monitoring), and the decision makers themselves have different DM styles (e.g., rational, dependent, intuitive, spontaneous). Moreover, at any given point in time in OSN, a participant decision maker plays a specific role (e.g., adviser, seeker, observer). We study the dynamic among DM phases, DM styles, and decision maker roles in OSN. Specifically, the goals of this study include understanding (1) how OSN are used as a support tool for DM, (2) which DM phases are most used by OSN users for DM, (3) how different stakeholder participation styles influence the support for DM phases through OSN use, and (4) related policy implications for developers of OSN Web sites. To operationalize our study, we use online survey methodology to observe, elicit, and understand the problems and requirements of OSN support for decision-making. Our results have policy implications for both OSN participants and designers.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We discuss necessary background and related literature in Section 2. In Section 3, we discuss our online survey as well as develop hypotheses that we then test using survey results. We conclude the paper with a brief discussion on the contributions as well as limitations of this study in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background and related literature</head><p>Decision-making is a theoretical and practical concept that is affected by cognitive insights of the decision maker. The process through which people make decisions ranges from structured to the anarchical. We now discuss decision making and its phases as well as decisionmaking styles. We then follow this with a brief discussion on decisionmaking as it relates to online social networks (OSN).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Decision-making (DM)</head><p>Extant literature in this area includes a vast selection of decisionmaking models, frameworks and theories that work towards evaluation of the decision-making processes. While clear distinctions exist between different decision-making artifacts, there are two dominant views of decision-making. One view clearly supports rational decision making, where models are sequential, decisions are structured, processes are analytical and solutions are terminated in a definite environment. In the other view, decision making is defined as an anarchical process, where problems are unstructured, decisions are irrational and the environment is uncertain.</p><p>Several variants and extensions of Simon's <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26]</ref> seminal theory of rational decision making have been proposed over the years. Many researchers followed Simon's view and even based further studies on Simon's rationality theory. For example, Mintzberg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[19]</ref> extended the Simon model by adding additional phases to the initial process; Rowe and Boulgarides <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">24]</ref> revised and modified the Simon model by adding an additional decision maker to the DM process. March <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[18]</ref> proposed an anarchical view of the DM process with his theory of ambiguity and bounded rationality. Supporters of this perspective focus on a different set of aspects of decision making and argue that the analytical decision-making approach does not cover most of the aspects of real-life decisions. Cohen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[3]</ref> view the DM process as a garbage can, where the solution does not have structure and choice, and alternatives can be retrieved at any point of the DM process.</p><p>Simon's <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26]</ref> model is the most recognizable and acceptable among existing decision-making models, so much so that it serves as the foundation for decision-making research. Simon <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26]</ref> suggested that the decision-making process can be structured and ordered in three phases: intelligence, design, choice. Intelligence is where the decision maker collects information about the problem, and identifies its cause(s). The second phase is recognition and understanding of possible alternatives and consequences of the future decision. In the last phase -choiceidentified alternatives are narrowed down to the best utility option that leads to a decision maker's choice. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes the taxonomy of the three phases of DM process.</p><p>Later, Huber and McDaniel <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[14]</ref> extended this model by adding two other phases: implementation and monitoring. Implementation is when the decision is put into effect, and monitoring comprises the post-analysis activities that evaluate the implementation of that decision; feedback and possible adjustments are also used in the development of direction for future DM situations.</p><p>Most published empirical research in this area has focused on aspects of the decision maker's mental abilities such as experience, knowledge, cognitive processes or factors that can influence the decision outcome. Chermack and Nimon <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[2]</ref> posit that measuring or developing the specific indicators for decision-maker performance is extremely difficult, but that it is essential to have an instrument that can study the pattern of decision-making performance. One of these instruments was developed by Scott and Bruce <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[25]</ref> to measure the DM style of an individual. DM style has been defined as "a habitual pattern individuals use in decision-making" <ref type="bibr">(Driver, 1979</ref>, as cited in <ref type="bibr">[25, p. 818]</ref>). Five decision styles were identified, and are defined in behavioral terms: (1) rational DM style is characterized by a thorough search for, and logical evaluation of, alternatives, (2) intuitive DM style is characterized by a search for advice and direction from others, (3) avoidant DM style is characterized by individuals who attempt to avoid the decisionmaking process entirely <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[8]</ref>, (4) spontaneous decision makers have a tendency to implement decisions immediately, and (5) dependent are individuals who constantly search for advice and depend on direction from others <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[8]</ref>. The resulting instrument has been named the General Decision-Making Style (GDMS) ( <ref type="bibr">[25, p. 820]</ref>).</p><p>The GDMS is designed to measure the participant's decision-making tendencies towards the decision process. Even in the original model, Scott and Bruce <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[25]</ref> differentiate decision makers according to their style; later, after testing the model, they came to the conclusion that a decision maker can rely on more than one style, but that is unlikely in the case of opposing styles such as rational and spontaneous. Driver et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[6]</ref> agree with Scott and Bruce and conclude that the decision maker has a primary and a secondary decision-making style.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Decision-making style</head><p>Decision-making style provides an understanding of decision-maker behavior that is taken for granted and unconsciously applied to decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[32]</ref>. To understand the decision maker's different styles it is important for the development of a decision model that can deal with individual behavior. Driver et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[6]</ref> argue that the main difference among DM styles occurs during information processing where the alternatives are identified. An influence on selection among alternative courses of action is recognized to be dependent on the decision maker's cognitive make-up <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[12]</ref>.</p><p>OSN have evolved from general friendship sites (i.e. Orkut, Facebook, Friendster, MySpace, and Classmates) to more specific userorientated sites. OSN have grown from a small niche group of youngsters to a significant fraction of Internet users who generate the highest user engagement rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[15]</ref>. While some of the OSN focus on growing globally (e.g., Facebook, Youtube, Google Plus), others explicitly seek a specific audience <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[1]</ref>. Examples of specific audience sites include Christianity.com and MyChurch.com, with these sites or similar ones targeting a particular demographic of participants. Others deliberately restrict access to selective individuals; an example is aSmallWorld.com which is said to be a network for elite only, where membership is strictly through invitation.</p><p>There are dozens of OSN sites, each offering something unique to its members. There are plenty of groups and classifications for distinguishing the online social communities. The main criteria for classification are taken from human interaction with each other in an offline environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Decision-making process in online social networks</head><p>To understand how OSN can support the DM process, we go back to the origin of the decision-making theory, specifically to Simon's <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26]</ref> DM-process. OSN are capable of many things that can positively and negatively influence the decision makers. The main question is how OSN can attenuate or amplify the decision-making process. OSN are information portals, and consequently they influence human information processing, where cognitive biases introduce barriers to adequate decisions.</p><p>People use OSN to support various phases of the DM process that fulfill the requirements to make a decision in a specific domain. OSN can attenuate or amplify the strengths and weaknesses of human information biases related to DM. This in turn can improve or disregard the decision-making process.</p><p>The Internet and online communications are appealing to organizations not only as a low cost way of reaching an audience, but also for the individual thoughts, opinions and histories that are accessed through the global community of Internet users. There are an immeasurable <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> Common operations in decision-making process. Adapted from: Malczewski <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[16]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Users of online social networks</head><p>Users in online communities are unique based on their participation style. OSN users are typified by their engagement levels in their participation communities.

OSN, by providing information, support the phases of the DM process; this support can be evaluated by understanding the problem through using OSN (intelligence); development of alternatives/ determination of consequences of various courses of action (design); selection of an option/alternative/course of action and comparison of consequences to resolve the problem by using OSN (choice); identification of resources and implementing an alternative course-of-action to make a decision (implementation); and monitoring/evaluation of implemented decision using OSN (monitoring). 3. Following the phases of the DM process, by sequence or anarchy, is unimportant; the OSN supported DM process fulfills the decisionmaker requirements.</p><p>1. The decision maker uses OSN to find information about decisions that can assist in the DM process. The information can be presented as the source of models, future choices, possible alternatives and consequences that come together with a decision.</p><p>The DM process by the use of OSN requires a proper investigation in order to understand the effectiveness of OSN in the role of decision supporter and information provider. We develop and use a survey methodology to understand the dynamics of DM in OSN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Online survey</head><p>The primary focus of this survey is to identify how online social networks support the decision-making process. The data collected for this study consisted of responses on how social networking services (SNS) and associated systems enhance or attenuate the decision-making strengths, weaknesses, and biases. We use the responses from online survey for hypothesis testing for decision-making in OSN. The survey questions are designed and based on the instruments extracted from the literature review. We used a pilot test as the simulation test to identify any problems prior to the data collection process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Hypotheses to be tested</head><p>The decision-making process can be regarded as a mental process that results in the selection of a course of action. We make our decisions based on a decision process that involves five phases (intelligence, design, choice, implementation and monitoring). When decision makers face a problem to be solved, they go through these five phases of DM process. In general, OSN are capable of providing support to the decision maker in the selection of the five phases of the decision-making process to solve a problem.</p><p>The research question for Hypothesis 1: What are the phases that are most supported by OSN users?</p><p>The research objective for Hypothesis 1: To compare each DM phase and its relationship to OSN use.</p><p>H1-1-Hypothesis 1. Online Social Networks support the decision-making process.</p><p>Explanation: Decision makers use OSN to support a certain DM process in order to solve a problem.</p><p>H1-0-Hypothesis 0. Online Social Networks do not support the decision-making process.</p><p>Explanation: Decision-makers do not necessarily use OSN to support a DM process to solve a problem. As discussed above, the decision-making process comprises five phases. To evaluate and test this hypothesis, and to identify the phases that are supported by decision makers through use of OSN, we divided the main hypothesis into five associated hypotheses ( <ref type="table">Table 2)</ref>.</p><p>The second hypothesis tests the relationship between decision maker style (rational, dependent, intuitive and spontaneous) and phases of the decision-making process (intelligence, design, choice, implementation and monitoring). Decision makers who tend to follow a particular style can use OSN in a different manner that reflects the support function of OSN for the DM process. Decision-making style is an important indicator of decision maker behavior that uses OSN to solve a problem.</p><p>The research question for Hypothesis 2: How do different decision maker styles influence the support function of OSN for DM process?</p><p>The research objectives for Hypothesis 2: To explore how different decision maker styles influence the different phases of the decision-making process. Hypothesis 2: DM style of OSN users affects the decision-making process.</p><p>Hypothesis 0: DM style of OSN users does not affect the decision-making process.</p><p>Hypothesis 2A: Rational and dependent decision-makers tend to find support in most (N2) phases of the DM process, whereas spontaneous and avoidant tend to find support in fewer phases of the decision-making process by use of OSN.</p><p>Hypothesis 0: Decision-makers of any style tend to find similar support in phases of the decision-making process by use of online social networks. There is no relationship between decision-making style and support for phases of the DM process by use of OSN. The null hypothesis is that the two variables, DM process and DM style, are independent. Hypothesis 2B: Spontaneous/intuitive and avoidant decision-makers will use OSN to support an intelligence and choice phase only.</p><p>H2-1-Hypothesis 2. Decision-making style of OSN users affects the decision-making process. Explanation: The DM process followed is dependent on the decision-making style of the OSN user. Therefore, the supportive use of OSN for decision-making will be different for each style.</p><p>H2-0-Hypothesis 0. Decision-making style of OSN users does not affect the decision-making process.</p><p>Explanation: The support use of OSN is not influenced by the decision-maker style. The DM style is divided into five characteristics. According to Scott and Bruce <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[25]</ref>, the decision maker can rely on more than one style. For the purpose of this study, two categories of DM style emerged: the first is rational and dependent and the second is spontaneous/intuitive and avoidant. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref> presents Hypothesis 2 and its sub-hypotheses that relate to the previously stated categorization of DM styles.</p><p>The third hypothesis tests the relationship between OSN users' participation roles and DM process phases.</p><p>The research question for Hypothesis 3: Is there any difference in OSN participation roles towards the use of OSN as the support mechanism for the DM process?</p><p>The research objective for Hypothesis 3: Compare OSN participation roles with the five phases of the DM process that a decision maker goes through in order to solve a problem.</p><p>H3-1-Hypothesis 3. OSN participation role affects the decision-making process.</p><p>Explanation: Diverse OSN participation roles will support the different phases or combination of phases of the decision-making process.</p><p>H3-0-Hypothesis 0. OSN participation role does not affect the decision-making process.</p><p>Explanation: OSN participation role and phases of the DM process are independent of each other. Therefore, the support function of OSN will not be affected by the participation role. The OSN participation role is split into three categories: Adviser, Seeker and Observer. For the purpose of this study, advisers and seekers were grouped together as active users of OSN and observers as passive users of OSN. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref> lists the sub-hypotheses of Hypothesis 3 to test how the different groups of participation roles support the different phases of the DM process. The null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between participation role in the DM process with respect to any group or characteristic of participation roles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Relevant instruments and literature</head><p>Developed by Scott and Bruce <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[25]</ref>, the GDMS instrument typifies individual differences in decision-making habits and practices. The 25 statements contain five items forming five different scales, each measuring a distinct behavioral approach to decision-making: spontaneous, rational, intuitive, dependent, and avoidant <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[7]</ref> (see Appendix A). GDMS is used with the Likert scale to measure the scores that range from strongly disagree to strongly agree <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[27]</ref>. Simon's <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26]</ref> model divides the decision-making process into three stages: intelligence, design and choice. Huber <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[13]</ref> later extended this model by adding two other stages: implementation and monitoring. We consider this model to be a research instrument that can direct the researcher to how OSN supports each phase of the decision-making process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Data collection</head><p>We administered the survey online and distributed a link to the survey via social media. The primary target population had a loose definition because the purpose of the study overall is exploratory, and therefore the opinion of individuals who use OSN for decision-making or for any other particular purpose is essential. The data collection period took five months. This period does not include design or pilot testing activities. 113 OSN users participated in completing the questionnaire and 73 completed responses were obtained; the response rate was 64.6%. It is important to note that out of 113 participants, 7 do not use OSN. Moreover, the response rate varied across different sections of the survey. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> shows the number of participants who answered/skipped questions for each section with the associated response rate.  Seeker and Adviser tend to find support in most (N3) of the phases of the DM process Hypothesis 3B: Observers tend to skip some of the phases of the DM process <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> Response rate for each section of the survey.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Data analysis</head><p>3.4.1. Descriptive statistics A majority of participants were from 18 to 34 years of age, the gender distribution was slightly skewed to the female dominance -60% of participants, and men presented 40% of the sample size. The life stage was equally distributed between singles and 'in relationship' participants, 34% and 32% respectively, followed by 22% who were married. The majority of the typical respondents were full-time employed -67% of the sample size. More than 15 countries were represented, with 61% of respondents living in New Zealand.</p><p>Most of the participants have used OSN sites for more than 3 years. The same distribution indicated that they are always logged on to social media or at least have access several times a day. On the question of 'how many OSN sites communities/groups are you member of?' -42.2% of respondents reported that they are members of 3 to 5 OSN sites and a similar percentage, 43.4%, reported that they use OSN for 75% personal purpose and 25% professional purpose.</p><p>The survey data shows a weak indication of professional users; the main explanation is the age of participants with a range of 18-34 years. According to <ref type="bibr">DiMauro and Bulmer's [5]</ref> study on OSN and professional use, their sample presented that younger (20-35) professionals are more active users of social media for professional purpose than middle-aged professionals.</p><p>With regard to participation style, 53% of respondents indicated that they are primarily observers, 31.3% are seekers and only 15.7% are advisers. The next question captured participation frequency, where results show that even with a small percentage of advisers, 24.1% of users provide advice at least once every few weeks, seek advice once in a few days -25.3%, and observe advice several times a day -44.6%. These results provide a good indication that users can admit the fact that they use OSN for seeking and providing information. These answers are supported by the next question, where users indicate that OSN are about information search, knowledge, news and entertainment: "I use OSN because they allow me to", and the most popular answers are: be informed and updated with current news -78.3%, find information -69.9%, find knowledge -57.8%, and find entertainment -56.6%.</p><p>Among these different uses of OSN, we are interested in how OSN are useful in terms of observing, advising, seeking and solving issues and problems for decision-making. Most of the participants indicated that OSN are useful for seeking information and observing discussions with regard to particular issues. 39.8% of participants found OSN to be a good tool for seeking information for professional issues, consumer issues -39.8%, then educational issues -34.9%, and health issues -33.7%. As for using OSN to observe discussions, most of the participants also relate to consumer and professional issues -37.3%, health issues comprise the same percentage as for seeking information -33.7% and the new groups of concern are personal relationships -38.6%. Since the question allowed for multiple responses, the sum of frequencies does not equal 100%. A surprising aspect from these results is the high popularity in the use of OSN for seeking purpose and the high demand for seeking and observing professional issues. Even without statistical analysis, it can be seen that results contradict with the previous question where participants did not indicate 'professional' as the primary reason for using OSN. That shows the design of the questionnaire to be very important; participants cannot always realize who the users are without verbal elements of assistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[4]</ref>. This question gave an opportunity for users to provide free response. One of the responses is indicted below:</p><p>i m still young professional to advise smone on smth,while he can find a solution for an issue from a professional with considerably more exprnce than i ve got. When i advise,though, i do it out of my OWN experience. When u seek for an advise frm social ntwrks to solve a problem i believe u should be sure abt whom u asking, because faceless interaction gives little guarantees on credibility of the opinion</p><p>This opinion expresses the concern with providing advice to others without being qualified to do so. The respondent is concerned with the quality of the provided information and subsequent results and makes a point that face-to-face advice is more valuable than interaction with OSN users. Section D captures the responses on OSN features and their relevance for DM. This section mainly serves the purpose of evaluating OSN features that are useful for DM. Features that received the highest relevant feedback are the ability of OSN to host forum conversations, tag people or links from other OSN providers, share photos, notification updates, join groups of similar interests, and search information by subject of interest or categories. Security settings are found to be the category with the highest percentage of extreme relevance for OSN users for the DM process. The high importance of security settings indicates that the main concern of OSN users is their privacy.</p><p>We discuss Section E of this survey in the next section on statistical analysis, as this section is mainly oriented towards answering the study hypothesis.</p><p>Section F, Decision-Making Style. The GDMS instrument was modified and users had to choose one option that suits their DM style. 51.3% of respondents refer to themselves as rational decision makers and 20.5% selected an intuitive DM style. This question can be biased, "presumably truthful response" <ref type="bibr">(Hansen, 1980</ref>, as cited in <ref type="bibr">[4, p. 27]</ref>) by information presentation and cognitive thinking; not everyone wants to admit that they are spontaneous or dependent decision makers.</p><p>Section G enquires whether respondents think that OSN can have an effect on human cognitive biases. Questions in this section are purely informative and were not designed for any statistical purpose. One of the study goals is to explore the effect of biases and their user's awareness. Most of the responses fell towards the opinion that biases increase with OSN use. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 6</ref> shows the response percentages for biases that people found to be the most affected with OSN use.</p><p>The descriptive analysis of the survey helps build a profile of a typical user of the OSN service. For example, a user has used OSN for more than 3 years and is a member of 3-5 sites, has a habit of accessing the networks more than several times per day, but participates mainly in the evenings and most probably in a home environment. This user can be identified mainly as an observer, and uses OSN excessively for seeking information and knowledge for decision-making. The user is familiar with most of the OSN features and can use them according to their purpose and also understands the effect of biases that can influence the decision-making process.</p></div>

The data collected from Section D (Qs23-Qs29), Section F (Qs37), Section C (Qs17, Qs18) are used for statistical analysis to test these hypotheses. The sample size includes only participants who use OSN in their daily lives, with respondents being identified from Question 9 by those who answered "yes" to the question: "Do you use Online Social Networks?" The total response count for these participants is 93. The missing responses were recorded and statistically handled with SPSS 'missing values add-on module'. The missing values from all the questions were removed by using the 'listwise deletion' method. This is the most commonly used method for dealing with missing data and it introduces the least bias into the statistical analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">20]</ref>.

This question allows multiple responses only for the first two options. If the respondent chose 'I use online social networks to help me search for information to support decision-making' and/or 'I provide information on online social networks to support the decision-making of others', then the replies were combined and identified as supporters of the intelligence phase of the DM process as follows: 'Qs23Yes = Qs23(001) + qs23(002)' and labeled as 'I Do Use'. Respondents who answered 'I do not use online social networks for understanding of problems' were identified as non-supporters of the intelligence phase of the DM process in order to solve a problem and were labeled as 'I Do not Use'.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion and conclusion</head><p>The primary focus of this study is to understand how OSN is used as a support tool for DM and which of its phases are most used by OSN users for DM. Our survey results show that most OSN users consider themselves as following the rational DM style. The main thoughts, discussions and considerations that took place in this study were bounded around the subject of the DM process and how it can be supported by the use of OSN. We now highlight the contribution of this research to the theoretical and practical world of DM and OSN.</p><p>OSN support decision makers in the most well accepted phases of the DM process. Our results provide evidence that OSN provide support for intelligence (information search), design (model of alternatives and options), and choice phases. This finding is aligned with the original Simon <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26]</ref> model of the DM process. <ref type="table">Table 9</ref> shows the support for DM in OSN based on our online survey in response to the research question: "What are the phases of DM process that are supported by use of OSN?"</p><p>An explanation on the observation of partial support for phase such as implementation can be derived based on the theory of the cognitive process of the decision maker. In the real-world, decisions are made unconsciously in the mind of the decision maker. From the perspective of the decision maker there is no intention to admit the decision implementation, for example, by the textual impressions in OSN. Survey results showed partial statistical support that the implementation phase is supported by use of OSN. While the actual 'objective' of implementation was not supported, the understanding and identification of resources that are required for implementation of the decision showed statistical significance. From the discussion above, it is apparent that OSN are used as a support tool, which helps find relevant information, understand alternatives, options, choices and consequences; observe and share the DM process experience, identify necessary resources for implementation and evaluation of outcomes from taken decisions.</p><p>Our analysis has not only provided evidence for OSN support in the DM process, but has also generated insights on how different participation styles of stakeholders influence the support of DM phases through use of OSN. The mean score of seekers and advisers on phases of DM are much higher than that of observers. Advisers (mean score 3.85) and seekers (mean score 3.91) find support in approximately four out of five phases of the DM process through use of OSN. Observers use only two out of five phases of the DM process (mean score 2.48). From a general understanding about types of DM style that have been provided in the literature, our results do not provide conclusive evidence that DM style has an influence on all phases of the decision-making process. However, the constantly changing world environment and speed of technology innovation have made access to information uncomplicated and undemanding; therefore the decision maker is exposed to different sources of information without an understanding of their effects. Regardless of their spontaneous, intuitive or avoidant style, the information database is readily available to the users, whereby through an easy search of the Internet they are able to make a decision while paying little attention to the phase of the DM process. The action of following the process might take as little as a minute to even years. OSN provide us the opportunity to find answers, interpretations, models and choices. The percentage allocation from the survey showed that dependent and rational decision makers are more willing to admit the fact that they use OSN in most of the phases of the DM process. As for avoidant, spontaneous and intuitive decision makers, when OSN users face a problem, they behave differently without following any particular sequence of DM phases.</p><p>Little is known on how OSN should be designed in order to influence or support the decision-making process. Several research areas provide insights towards accomplishing a successful design that can generate revenue. However, the absence of theoretical guidance on how to contract a design for this specific purpose has resulted in the development of many features and tools that can irritate online users <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[11]</ref>. This is especially salient in the case of DM where people are searching for <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> Summary of the research questions, hypotheses, data analysis and variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research questions Objectives Hypothesis Data analysis Variables</head><p>What are the phases that are most supported by OSN users?</p><p>To compare each of the five phases of DM process and its relationship with the use of OSN H.1 Online social networks support the decision-making process H.0 Online social networks do not support the decision-making process <ref type="table">Chi-square test  Intelligence  Design  Choice  Implementa-</ref>  concrete answers, where they can be easily irritated by useless website features.</p><p>Rather than creating a virtual space without understanding or copying the design from successful sites, the hosted organization should appraise the decision-maker experience that supports the decisionmaking process through OSN and mirrors this requirements through the design of the website <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[11]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Yaping et al. [30]</ref> argue that with the development of OSN infrastructure, some website features become more complex because the websites are aiming for complete advantage and ways to differentiate themselves from others. But complex website features do not always attract more users, and especially will not keep them for a long time; the goal of an OSN site is to ensure that users spend more time browsing around the topics, asking questions and participating in the discussions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[30]</ref>. OSN face a constant battle of attracting new visitors to their websites and maintaining or increasing the interest level of its members <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[5]</ref>. In the case of OSN for DM, it is vital to attract experts who can provide quality and peer-reviewed information for DM.</p><p>Hausman and Siekpe <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[11]</ref> suggest that successful websites should consider the use of 3D graphics, the use of humor and innovative 'techno-savvy' tools. In the case of OSN for DM, the priority is to provide useful and instructive information by enabling the decision-maker to use it for all phases of the DM process. In addition to the identified features in and responses on relevance of these features from our online survey study, results show that decision makers are especially attracted to the search engines that help with information retrieval. Search engines are found to be one of the essential decision-support tools that can accommodate the decision maker's query.</p><p>Although the factor of irritation has been mentioned before, some of the OSN participants demand the innovativeness that eventually helps website providers to keep their members. For example, in health OSN (HOSN), the body mass indicator (BMI) or symptom checker has its niche among health decision-makers. Most OSN users are familiar with the generic website functions for DM; the user behavioral intention to share or contribute to the networks is based on this environmental aspects. Results from our study indicate that users appreciate the opportunity to create personal profiles and the possibility of sharing photos or informational links.</p><p>We now discuss some of the challenges and limitations that we encountered during this study. Use of online survey interface for distributing a questionnaire offers many advantages as well as some disadvantages that we had to face. The main limitations that have been exposed in this study are associated with sampling, response rate, and demographics.</p><p>First is the sampling issue, with the main goal to target the users of OSN for DM. The responses from the online survey represented only the general public who use OSN in their everyday lives. The question that can be asked is whether these OSN participants are aware of their DM process by use of OSN and how they are different from experienced users of OSN for DM. The respondents were asked if they use OSN for DM, but there is no way to ensure that the participants actually support their DM by use of OSN or that they follow a rational decision making process.</p><p>Second, there were two related problems, namely insufficient responses and a reasonably high drop-out rate for different questions. These two problems led to some missing data and thus reduced the qualified responses for analysis. This can be explained by the questionnaire taking approximately 30 min to complete, and the respondents may not have felt encouraged to complete it. There is a possibility that providing a reward for participants to participate could boost the response rate and prevent users from quitting the survey before its completion. The chance to win a prize or gift certificate, as reward for participation, however, could result in multiple responses by the same individuals and misrepresentation of background information. <ref type="table">Table 8</ref> Outcome for Hypothesis 1.</p></div>
