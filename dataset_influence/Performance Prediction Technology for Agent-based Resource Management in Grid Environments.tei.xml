				<p>Resource management constitutes an important infrastructural component of a computational grid environment. The aim of grid resource management is to efficiently schedule applications over the available resources provided by the supporting grid architecture. Such goals within the high performance community rely, in part, on accurate performance prediction capabilities. This paper introduces a resource management infrastructure for grid computing environments. The technique couples application performance prediction with a hierarchical multi-agent system. An initial system implementation utilises the performance prediction capabilities of the PACE toolkit to provide quantitative data regarding the performance of complex applications running on local grid resources. The validation results show that a high level of accuracy can be obtained, that cross-platform comparisons can be easily undertaken, and that the estimates can be evaluated rapidly. A hierarchy of homogeneous agents are used to provide a scalable and adaptable abstraction of the grid system architecture. An agent is a representative of a local grid resource and is considered to be both a service provider and a service requestor. Agents are organised into a hierarchy and cooperate to provide service advertisement and discovery. A performance monitor and advisor has been developed to optimise the performance of the agent system. A case study with corresponding experimental results are included to demonstrate the efficiency of the resource management and scheduling system. The main features of the system include: hard quality of service support using PACE performance prediction capabilities; agent-based dynamic resource advertisement and discovery capabilities; simulation-based quantitative grid performance analysis and user-oriented scheduling of local grid resources.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>It is anticipated that grid computing will deliver high performance computing capabilities and resource sharing among dynamic virtual organisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">14]</ref>. An essential component of grid infrastructure software is the service layer, which acts as middleware between grid resources and grid applications. This work considers the resource management service, which must efficiently map applications to available resources within a grid environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref>. Such goals within the high performance community will rely on accurate performance prediction capabilities.</p><p>An existing toolkit, known as PACE (Performance Analysis and Characterisation Environment) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[23]</ref>, is used to provide quantitative predictive data concerning the performance of complex applications running on a local grid resource. The framework of PACE is based on a layered methodology that separates software and hardware system components through the use of parallelisation templates. The PACE performance prediction capabilities have been validated using an ASCI (Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative) kernel application called Sweep3D. This application illustrates the level of accuracy that can be obtained, that cross-platform comparisons can be easily undertaken, and that the process benefits from a rapid evaluation time <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. While extremely well-suited for managing locally distributed multi-computers, PACE functions map less well onto a wide-area environment, where the process of resource management becomes far more complex. In order to meet the requirements of performance prediction for grid computing environments, both scalability and adaptability of prediction systems are two key challenges that must be addressed.</p><p>? Scalability: A grid has the potential to encompass a large number of high performance computing resources. Each constituent of this grid will have its own function, its own resources and environment. These components are not necessarily fashioned to work together in the overall grid. They may be physically located in different organisations and may not be aware of each others capabilities.</p><p>? Adaptability: A grid is a dynamic environment where the location, type, and performance of the components are constantly changing. For example, a component resource may be added to, or removed from, the grid at any time. These resources may not be entirely dedicated to the grid and therefore the computational capabilities of the system will vary over time.</p><p>An agent-based methodology has been developed for the management of large-scale distributed systems with highly dynamic behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref>. The system consists of a hierarchy of homogenous agents where each agent can be considered both a service provider and a service requestor. Multiple homogeneous agents are organised into federated groups, which have capabilities of service advertisement and discovery. Different optimisation strategies and performance metrics are defined and used to improve the agent behaviours. Issues related to the utilisation of an agent-based methodology for grid resource management is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref>. In this paper, an initial implementation of the agent-based grid resource management system is described. The agent acts as a local resource manager, using a user-oriented scheduling algorithm and coupled with PACE to provide predictive capabilities regarding local grid resources and the services they can provide. At a meta-level, agents cooperate to advertise and discover services. A case study and corresponding experimental results are included in this paper. The results demonstrate the effect of management and scheduling obtained through the cooperation of an agent system coupled with the PACE performance prediction tool.</p><p>There are several solutions that currently address issues of grid resource management and scheduling. These include Globus <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Legion [12]</ref>, NetSolve <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[10]</ref>, Condor <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref>, Ninf <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[22]</ref> and Nimrod/G <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. While many of these projects utilise query-based mechanisms for resource discovery and advertisement <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref>, this work adopts an agent-based approach. The agent-based system allows agents to control the query process and make resource discovery decisions based on their own internal logic rather than rely on a fixed function query engine. The resource management system described in this work can provide hard quality of service (QoS) support as defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref>. However, unlike Nimrod/G, in which grid resource estimation is performed through heuristics and historical information, the performance prediction capabilities in this research are provided through PACE. In the Condor system, scheduling aims to maximise the utilisation of grid resources (resource-oriented); another approach, favoured by Nimrod and the research in this paper, is to provide a system which meets user specified deadlines (user-oriented).</p><p>Several new grid projects utilise existing distributed computing technologies such as CORBA <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[26]</ref> and Jini <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. CORBA is not designed for the development of high performance computing applications, however there has been research aimed at providing CORBA based tools in a variety of different contexts. For example, in the work described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[30]</ref> a CORBA Commodity Grid (CoG) Kit enables the development of advanced Grid applications which maintain state-of-the-art software engineering practices and also reuse existing grid infrastructure. However, such technologies only enable resource sharing within a single organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[14]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[15]</ref> a computational community that supports the federation of resources from different organisations is described; this system is designed and implemented in Java and Jini. JiPANG (A Jini-based Portal Augmenting Grids) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[28]</ref> is a portal system and a toolkit that provides a uniform access interface layer to a variety of grid systems. This allows the development of Jini-based systems on top of the Java platform.</p><p>Agent technologies have been used for the development of distributed software systems for several years <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[16]</ref>. An agent-based approach provides a clear high-level abstraction and a more flexible system implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[17]</ref>. Multi-agent systems have recently been introduced in grid development and resource management. This work <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[18]</ref> includes a model for distributed awareness and a framework for the dynamic assembly of agents for the monitoring of network resources. An "Agent Grid" is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25]</ref> that integrates services and resources for establishing multidisciplinary Problem Solving Environments (PSEs). Specialised agents contain behavioural rules and can modify these rules based on their interaction with other agents and with the environment in which they operate. The agent-based methodology used in this research can also be used for the integration of multiple services and resources. This is done using hierarchy of homogenous agents, rather than by utilising a collection of specialised agents.</p><p>The agent-based system described in this work is investigated through quantitative performance analysis using modelling and simulation techniques. Other grid simulation models have been built: Simgrid <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref> is a simulation toolkit for the study of scheduling algorithms for distributed applications; GridSim <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[21]</ref> investigates effective resource allocation techniques based on a computational economy. Grid performance modelling and simulation is a valuable tool, especially as current grid computing research has a limited number of practical grid environments and research test-beds with which to work <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The paper is organised as follows: section 2 introduces the PACE toolkit and corresponding methodology for performance prediction; in section 3, the system architecture and agent resource management system are described; a case study and experimental results are included in section 4; the paper concludes in section 5. existing objects can be retrieved from an Object Library. The performance descriptions are collated into application PSL scripts which are then compiled into an Application Model.

The PACE toolkit was not however developed in the context of grid computing. In order to apply PACE to grid problems a number of modifications have been made. One of these modifications is the inclusion of transaction-based performance modelling.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Transaction-based Modelling</head><p>An agent-based approach is used to integrate PACE functionality with grid resource management. In this section, both the overall architecture of the system and the structure of an individual agent are described.</p><p>PACE operates by characterising an application in terms of its principle operations and its parallelisation strategy. It then couples these requirements with the hardware resources to obtain predictions of execution times. At present, costs are associated with individual machine level instructions which allows the toolkit to model detailed subtleties in an application code. This is considered too fine grained for grid applications and so variant of PACE is currently under development which uses 'transactions' as base units of work <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[27]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows the original PACE structure (depicted on the left) which describes applications by means of a layered modelling language. While maintaining the same structure, the coarse-grained PACE (on the right) utilises transactions and transaction maps to characterise applications more rapidly. An application is represented as a number of transactions each of which encapsulate key components of an application code; a transaction map describes the interrelationships between these transactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">System Architecture</head><p>An overview of the agent-based resource management architecture is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. The main components include grid users, grid resources, agents and a performance monitor and advisor (PMA). These are introduced in detail below.  Transaction-based application modelling enables efficient remote performance evaluation and prediction to be performed. This makes the toolkit highly appropriate for use in dynamic grid-like environments which consist of a number of heterogeneous systems. The aim of this research is to enable this approach without sacrificing performance accuracy. The kernel of the system is defined in a transaction definition language (TDL); this is described in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[29]</ref>.</p><p>There are different kinds of users of a grid computing environment. These include grid service and tool developers, application developers and grid end users.</p><p>The developers of the tools, compilers, libraries, and so on implement the programming models and services used by application developers. MPI and PVM are included in these categories. Grid service and tool developers are a small group of grid users and are therefore not the main focus in the context of this work.</p><p>Application developers comprise those who construct grid-enabled applications using grid tools. There are different kinds of grid applications: distributed supercomputing, high throughput, on demand, data intensive and collaborative applications. The applications described in this work mainly refer to scientific supercomputing applications; that is, large problems requiring a large amount of CPU and memory, etc., and which are (for the most part) written using MPI and PVM.</p><p>Most grid users, like most users of computers or networks today, will not write programs. Instead, these end users will use grid-enabled applications that make use of grid resources and services. In some cases, application developers will also be the end users of the applications that they develop. The grid users in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>, and mentioned in the following sections, are considered to be scientists, who develop scientific supercomputing applications and who use them to solve large problems in a grid context.</p><p>The user-side software primarily includes the PACE Application Tools. When a parallel application is developed, a corresponding application model is also produced. PACE performance modelling is an automated process, targeted at the non-professional performance engineer. When an application is submitted for execution, an associated performance model should also be attached.</p><p>Another component included in a grid request is the cost model, describing the user requirements concerning the application execution. This would include, for example, the deadline for the application to complete. Although there are a number of other metrics appropriate in this context, the current focus of this work is on execution time.</p><p>high performance computing capabilities. Agents are organised into a hierarchy. The hierarchy of homogenous agents provides a meta-level view of the grid resources. The service information of each grid resource can be advertised in the agent hierarchy (both upwards and downwards); agents can also cooperate with each other to discover available resources.</p><p>Each agent utilises Agent Capability <ref type="table">Tables (ACTs)</ref> to record service information of other agents. An ACT item is a tuple containing an agent ID and corresponding service information.</p><p>An agent can choose to maintain different types of ACTs according to different sources of service information. For example, T_ACT is used to record the service information of local resources. Each agent can also have one L_ACT to record the service information received from its lower agents and one G_ACT from the upper agent. C_ACT is used to store cached service information.</p><p>There are two methods of maintaining ACT coherency -data-pull and data-push, each of which occur periodically or can be driven by system events.</p><p>? Data-pull -An agent asks other agents for their service information either periodically or when a request arrives.</p><p>? Data-push -An agent submits its service information to other agents in the system periodically or when the service information is changed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Grid Resources</head><p>A grid resource can provide high performance computing capabilities for grid users. A resource can include Massive Parallel Processors (MPP), or a cluster of workstation or PCs. A grid resource can be considered a service provider of high performance computing capabilities.</p><p>In this system, PACE is used to create a hardware characterisation template that provides a model of each hardware resource. This characterisation is derived from computational and communication benchmarks which can be rapidly evaluated to provide dynamic performance data. The PACE hardware model is integral to the service information which is advertised across the agent hierarchy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Agents</head><p>Agents comprise the main components in the system. Each agent is viewed as a representative of a grid resource at a meta-level of resource management. An agent can therefore be considered a service provider of An agent uses the ACTs as a knowledge base. This is used to assist in the service discovery process triggered by the arrival of a request. Service discovery involves querying the contents of the ACTs in the order: T_ACT, C_ACT, L_ACT, and G_ACT. If an agent exhausts the ACTs, and does not obtain the required service information, it can submit the request to its upper agent or terminate the discovery process.</p><p>The simple protocol of service advertisement and discovery described above allows agents to be configured with different strategies, leading to different agent behaviours. Agents advertise and discover services according to their own internal logic; this allows a flexible implementation of grid resource management.</p><p>The PACE evaluation engine is integrated into each agent. Its performance prediction capabilities are used for local resource management in the scheduling of parallel applications over available local processors. The evaluation engine is also used to provide support to the service discovery process.</p><p>The agent system bridges the gap between grid application users and grid resources. A introduction to the use of agent-based service discovery for grid resource management can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref>. The agent hierarchy also allows scalability to be addressed. Service advertisement and discovery are processed stepwise between neighbouring agents only. This feature plays an important part in system scalability. Another important factor is the capacity for agents to be able to adjust their service advertisement and discovery behaviours, thus adapting to the highly dynamic grid environment. This is achieved through the introduction of a performance monitor and advisor.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scheduler</head><p>Performance issues arise from the dynamic nature of the grid resources. Unlike other work that focus on data representation and communication protocols, this research enables the performance of the agent system to be investigated quantitatively. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> shows the monitoring role of the PMA. The PMA observes agent communication traffic with the intention of improving agent performance.</p><p>Unlike facilitators or brokers in classical agent-based systems, the PMA is not central to the rest of the agents. It neither controls the agent hierarchy nor serves as a communication centre in the physical and symbolic sense. If the PMA ceases to function, the agent system has no operational difficulties and continues with ordinary system behaviour. Efficiency improvements to the agent system are only made possible through the modelling and simulation mechanism built into the PMA. The PMA also avoids any one agent in the system becoming a single system bottleneck.</p><p>The PMA is composed of a model composer and a simulation engine. Statistical data is monitored from each of the agents and input to the PMA for performance modelling. The performance model is processed by the simulation engine in the PMA so that new optimisation strategies can be chosen and the performance metrics improved. The process of simulation allows a number of strategies to be explored until a better solution is selected. The selected optimisation strategies are then returned and used to reconfigure the agents in the system.</p><p>The metrics used to describe the performance of the agent system include the service discovery speed, the overall system efficiency, the load balancing and also the discovery success rate. Corresponding performance optimisation strategies include the use made of the ACTs, the limits placed on the service lifetime and the scope of advertisement and discovery, agent mobility and the service distribution. These features are not described in detail in this paper; for more information of these and other aspects of the system, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>.  There are four components in the coordination layer of an agent: the ACT manager, the PACE evaluation engine, a scheduler and a matchmaker. They work together to make decisions as to how an agent should act on the receipt of messages from the communication layer. For example, the final response to a service discovery message would involve application execution on the local resource or the dispatching of the request to another agent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACTs</head><p>The main functions of local resource management in an agent include application management, resource allocation and resource monitoring. Application execution commands are sent from the coordination layer to the local agent manager, these commands include the scheduling information for an application (start time, allocated processor ids etc). The Application Management part of the system is also responsible for managing the queuing of applications that have been scheduled to be executed on the locally managed resources. At the start time an application is dispatched to the Resource Allocation component. Resource allocation includes wrappers for different application execution environments including MPI and PVM; it is at this stage that the application is actually executed on the local scheduled processors. Another important component of local resource management is the resource monitoring. This is responsible for controlling the PACE benchmark programs which are executed on the local resource and from which corresponding resource models are dynamically created. The resource monitor is also responsible for communicating other resource and application information between the application management and resource allocation modules. It also coordinates all the collected information concerning local resource into service information which is then reported to the T_ACT in the coordination layer of the agent.</p><p>These agent functions are described in detail below. In particular, the implementation of the agent coordination layer is emphasised and the four main components of the scheduling algorithm are documented.</p><p>Consider a grid resource with n processors where each processor P i has its own type ty i . A PACE hardware model can be used to describe the performance information of this processor: If m is the number of applications that are running, or being queued to be executed on a grid resource, then each application A j has two attributes -a scheduled start time ts j and an end time te j . The applications of a grid resource can then be expressed as follows: </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">{ } P P i n i = = | , ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">{ } A A j m j = = | , ,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">ACT Manager</head><p>The ACT manager controls agent access to the ACT database, where service information regarding grid resources is located. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> illustrates the content of this service information.</p><p>where k j is the number of processors that are allocated to application A j . M then is a 2D array, which describes the mapping relationships between resources and applications using boolean values. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 5. Service Information</head><p>Service information for a grid resource should include details of those aspects that have an impact on the performance of the resource and can therefore be used to evaluate its performance. Service information is therefore composed of resource information, application information, and the mapping between the applications and the resources.</p><p>The request information consists of the PACE application model (am), which includes all performance related information of an application A r .

On the one hand, the start time of application execution may be earlier if only a number of processors are selected; on the other hand, with some applications, execution time may become longer if too many processors are allocated.</p><p>The scheduling algorithm described above is used in an initial system implementation.

The scheduler should consider all these possibilities and choose the earliest end time of the application execution. In any of these situations, the end time is equal to the earliest possible start time plus the execution time, which is described as follows:</p><p>te ts exet r r = + .</p><p>The earliest possible start time for application A r on a selection of processors is the latest free time of all the selected processors if there are still applications running on the selected processors. If there is no application currently running on the selected processors, application A r can be executed on these processors immediately. These is expressed as follows:</p><p>It is clear that if the number of processors of a grid resource increases, the complexity of the local resource scheduling algorithm will increase exponentially. Though a local resource in grid environment can only have limited number of processors, this algorithm cannot scale well when the number of processors increases. Another factor is that the scheduling policy of this algorithm is to meet requirements from the user, instead of maximising the resource utilisation. There is no rescheduling process for previously scheduled applications. New algorithms need to be developed for such cases.</p><p>The importance of the efficiency of the PACE evaluation engine is clear. During each scheduling process, the evaluation function can be called 2 n -1 times. Even in the situation where all the processors of a grid resource are of the same type, the evaluation function still needs to be called n times. PACE evaluation can be performed very quickly to produce prediction results 'on the fly'; this is a key feature in the use of PACE for grid resource management and in the provision of predictive QoS support for service discovery.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S 8</head><p>Sun SPARCstation 2 16</p><p>Experiments have been designed using the initial system implementation. There are two main parts in the design of the experiments. The system itself includes agents, resources and agent behaviour strategies used in the experiment. The automatic users of the system are also designed to send application execution requests with different frequencies, which add different workloads onto the system. Experimental results are also included to illustrate how the agent-based resource management system schedules applications onto available resources.</p><p>In the experimental system, each agent maintains a set of capability tables -T_ACT, L_ACT and G_ACT. T_ACTs are maintained by the event-driven data-push service advertisement. L_ACTs are updated every ten seconds using a data-pull. G_ACTs are also updated by data-pull, at a frequency of every thirty seconds. All of the agents employ identical strategies with the exception of the agent at the head of the hierarchy (S 1 ) that does not maintain a G_ACT.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">System Design</head><p>There are eight agents in the experimental system. The agent hierarchy is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref>. The applications used in the experiments include typical scientific computing programs. Each application has been modelled and evaluated using PACE. An example of PACE predications for the system S 1 , which represents the most powerful resource in the experiment, can be found in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>. The predictions for the other systems follow a similar trend and are therefore omitted.</p><p>As shown in the figure, the run time of sweep3d decreases when the number of processors increases. At the same time the parallel efficiency also decreases. In fact, when the number of processors is more than 16, the run time does not improve any further. The results of the application improc show a different trend. Run time of improc decreases to an optimum of 8 processes -after which the run time then increases. Different applications have very different performance scenarios which has an important impact on the application scheduling results.</p><p>The agent at the head of the hierarchy is S 1 , which has three lower agents: S 2 , S 3 , and S 4 . The agent S 2 has The experimental results can be found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Tables 4  and 5</ref>. These illustrate the number of applications accepted by a particular agent in each experiment and also the number of service discovery steps required to meet the overall workload. Tasks can be rejected by the system (failed) if insufficient resources are available to meet the requirements of the user.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. Experiment Results: Application Execution</head><p>An application execution request for one of the seven test applications is sent at random to an agent. Additionally, the required execution time for the application is also selected randomly from a given domain; the bounds of the application requirements can be found in    The interval of requests sent in each experiment is chosen randomly from a given domain, resulting in</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment No. 1</head><p>In this experiment, the system workload is light relative to the system capabilities, with an application request being sent every four seconds. This results in a balanced application distribution on the agents and the amount of requests that end unsuccessfully is small. <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 5</ref> illustrates that 97% of service requests are completed with no service discovery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment No. 2</head><p>When the system workload becomes heavier, S 7 and S 8 cannot meet the computational requirements, and therefore submit the request to their upper agent S 4 . This leads to a 6% increase in workload on S 4 , and a 13% increase in the number of 1-step discovery requests. While heavily loaded, S 1 is sufficiently powerful to serve 19% of the total application requests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment No. 3</head><p>The system workload increases further. The 5% decrease of application executions on S 4 indicates that the local resource of S 4 has reached its capability. Requests submitted from S 7 and S 8 are passed to S 1 , which leads to an 8% increase in the number of 2-step discovery processes. Service discovery amongst the agents becomes more active when the system workload increases. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref> illustrates the trend in service discovery. As the system becomes more heavily loaded, the number of 0-step discoveries decreases with a related increase in the number of 1-step processes. Similarly, as load increases further the number of 1-step processes decreases with a rise in 2-step discovery. In general, when the workload increases, more complex service discovery processes occur while simpler ones disappear. However, because the number of agents in the experimental system is small, no more complex (more than 4-step) service discovery processes occur. Experiment four represents a heavily loaded system. A decrease of 6% in accepted applications on S 1 indicates that S 1 has also reached its capacity. This doubles the number of failed requests. The number of 1-step discovery processes decreases by 8%, while 2-step and 3-step service discovery processes increase by 3%. This indicates that the whole system has reached its capability limit, resulting in more complex service discovery in order to find available resources. With the workload increasing, the trends for the distributions of application execution and service discovery are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figures 8 and 9</ref> respectively. Some generalised information can be concluded. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref> illustrates that when the system workload increases, resources will reach their computational capabilities in turn. The more powerful a resource is, the later it reaches its limitation. The peaks appearing at the curves S 1 and S 4 indicate the time the corresponding resource reaches its limitation.</p><p>Another interesting phenomenon is that the system workload is balanced when it is extremely light in experiment 1 and heavy in experiment 4. In experiment 1, this occurs as a result of averagely sent requests and the need for no service discovery, while in experiment 4, the distribution of applications over the eight systems is balanced according to the system capabilities. The agent load corresponds to the computing capabilities of the respective resource. The agents S 1 and S 2 , which represent the most powerful resources in the experimental environment, serve a larger percentage of the applications, this is followed by S 3 , S 4 , S 6 and S 5 . Only a small percentage of the requests are serviced by the agents S 7 and S 8 . While this experimental system is far from a representative grid-sized environment, the experimental results demonstrate that the performance-driven agentbased resource management, utilising service advertisement and discovery, is effective for scheduling applications that require grid-like distributed resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>The use of performance prediction techniques for agent-based resource management in grid environments is presented in this work. An initial implementation of an agent-based resource management system is described. A case study is described in detail to demonstrate the efficiency of the resource management and scheduling capabilities of the system. The main features in this work include:</p><p>? hard QoS support using the PACE performance prediction capabilities;</p><p>? agent-based dynamic resource advertisement and discovery;</p><p>? simulation-based quantitative grid performance analysis;</p><p>? and user-oriented scheduling of local grid resources.</p><p>Future work will focus on the system enhancement. Some existing standards, languages, tools and protocols can be utilised. For example, the agents and the PMA can be developed using Java and an XML format for data representation. An agent communication language (ACL) can be used to allow agents to communicate with each other at a higher-abstracted knowledge level. The system will also be integrated with current grid standard toolkit Globus.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Agent Structure The communication layer of each agent performs communication functions and acts as an interface to the external environment. From the communication module, an agent can receive both service advertisement and discovery messages. It interprets the contents of each message and submits the information to corresponding modules in the coordination layer of the agent. For example, an advertisement message from another agent will be directly sent to the ACT manager in the agent coordination layer. The communication module is also responsible for sending service advertisement and discovery messages to other agents. There are four components in the coordination layer of an agent: the ACT manager, the PACE evaluation engine, a scheduler and a matchmaker. They work together to make decisions as to how an agent should act on the receipt of messages from the communication layer. For example, the final response to a service discovery message would involve application execution on the local resource or the dispatching of the request to another agent. The main functions of local resource management in an agent include application management, resource allocation and resource monitoring. Application execution commands are sent from the coordination layer to the local agent manager, these commands include the scheduling information for an application (start time, allocated processor ids etc).
