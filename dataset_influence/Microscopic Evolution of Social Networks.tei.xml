				<p>We present a detailed study of network evolution by analyzing four large online social networks with full temporal information about node and edge arrivals. For the first time at such a large scale, we study individual node arrival and edge creation processes that collectively lead to macroscopic properties of networks. Using a methodology based on the maximum-likelihood principle, we investigate a wide variety of network formation strategies, and show that edge locality plays a critical role in evolution of networks. Our findings supplement earlier network models based on the inherently non-local preferential attachment. Based on our observations, we develop a complete model of network evolution, where nodes arrive at a prespecified rate and select their lifetimes. Each node then independently initiates edges according to a &quot;gap&quot; process, selecting a destination for each edge according to a simple triangle-closing model free of any parameters. We show analytically that the combination of the gap distribution with the node lifetime leads to a power law out-degree distribution that accurately reflects the true network in all four cases. Finally, we give model parameter settings that allow automatic evolution and generation of realistic synthetic networks of arbitrary scale. For example, the observation of heavy-tailed degree distributions [10] led to hypothesis about edge creation processes (e.g., preferential attachment [1]) that could lead to this observation. In fact, there are several edge creation processes that all lead to heavy-tailed degree distributions and it is not clear which among them captures reality best. Here we take a different approach. Instead of only focusing on the global network structure and then hypothesizing about what kind of microscopic node behavior would reproduce the observed macroscopic network structure, we focus directly on the microscopic node behavior per se. For the first time at such a large scale, we study a sequence of millions of individual edge arrivals, which allows us to directly evaluate and compare microscopic processes that give rise to global network structure.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In recent years a wide variety of models have been proposed for the growth of complex networks. These models are typically advanced in order to reproduce statistical network properties observed in real-world data. They are evaluated on the fidelity with which they reproduce these global network statistics and patterns. In many cases, the goal is to define individual node behaviors that result in a global structure such as power law node degree distributions; in other cases, the goal is to match some other network property such as small diameter.</p><p>Part of this work was done while the first and second authors were visiting Yahoo! Research.</p><p>Data and model structure. We consider four large online social network datasets -FLICKR (flickr.com, a photo-sharing website), DELICIOUS (del.icio.us, a collaborative bookmark tagging website), YAHOO! ANSWERS (answers.yahoo.com, a knowledge sharing website), and LINKEDIN (linkedin.com, a professional contacts website) -where nodes represent people and edges represent social relationships. These networks are large with up to millions of nodes and edges, and the time span of the data ranges from four months to almost four years. All the networks are in early stages of their evolution with the connected component being small and the clustering coefficient increasing over time.</p><p>We consider models that can be decomposed into three core processes, namely, the node arrival process (governs the arrival of new nodes into the network), the edge initiation process (determines for each node when it will initiate a new edge), and the edge destination selection process (determines the destination of a newly initiated edge). Our networks do not include removal of nodes or edges, so we do not model deletion (although we do model the "death" of a node in the sense that it ceases producing new edges).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">RELATED WORK</head><p>Our results. We begin with a series of analyses of our four networks, capturing the evolution of key network parameters, and evaluation of the extent to which the edge destination selection process subscribes to preferential attachment. We show that the inherently non-local nature of preferential attachment is fundamentally unable to capture important characteristics in these networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct large-scale validation of the preferential attachment model in real networks.</p><p>Next, we provide a detailed analysis of the data in order to consider parsimonious models for edge destination selection that incorporate locality. We evaluate a wide variety of such models using the maximum-likelihood principle and choose a simple triangleclosing model that is free of parameters. Based on the findings, we then propose a complete network evolution model that accurately captures a variety of network properties. We summarize our model based on the three processes listed earlier.</p><p>Many studies on online social networks, world wide web, and biological networks focused on macroscopic properties of static networks such as degree distributions, diameter, clustering coefficient, communities, etc; work in this area includes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.

The copying <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and the preferential attachment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> models belong to this category. The Forest Fire model <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> attempts to explain the densification and decreasing-diameter phenomena observed in real networks. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for a topic survey.</p><p>Recently, researchers examined the finer aspects of edge creation by focusing on a small set of network snapshots.

Simmel theorized that people with common friends are more likely to create friendships and Krackhardt and Handcock <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> applied this theory to explain the evolution of triangle closures. A network model based on closed triangles was proposed by Shi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>The maximum-likelihood principle has been typically used to estimate network model parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> or for model selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, which often requires expensive computations of high dimensional integrals over all possible node arrival sequences. In contrast, we use the likelihood in a much more direct way to evaluate and compare different modeling choices at a microscopic level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">PRELIMINARIES</head><p>Node arrival process. We find large variation in node arrival rates over the four networks, ranging from exponential to sub-linear growth. Thus we treat node arrival rate as input to our model. Edge initiation process. Upon arrival, a node draws its lifetime and then keeps adding edges until reaching its lifetime, with edges inter-arrival rate following a power law with exponential cut-off distribution. We find that edge initiations are accelerating with node degree (age), and prove that this leads to power law out degree distributions. The model produces accurate fits and high likelihood.</p><p>Datasets. For each of our four large network datasets, we know the exact time of all the node/edge arrivals. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> gives the basic statistics of the four networks. All the networks slowly densify with a densification exponent <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> ¦Ñ ¡Ö 1.2. All the networks, except DELICIOUS, have shrinking diameter. In FLICKR, ANSWERS, and LINKEDIN, the effective diameter reaches the maximum value of 10 when the network has around 50,000 nodes, and then slowly decreases to the around 7.5; in DELICIOUS, the diameter is practically constant. Also, in all the networks, a majority of edges are bidirectional (column E b ). The reciprocity is 73% in FLICKR, 81% in DELICIOUS, and 58% in ANSWERS; LINKEDIN is undirected, but we know the edge initiator. The fraction of nodes that belongs to the largest weakly connected component is 69% in FLICKR, 72% in DELICIOUS, 81% in ANSWERS, and 91% in LINKEDIN.</p><p>Edge destination selection process. We find that most edges (30%-60%) are local as they close triangles, i.e., the destination is only two hops from the source. We consider a variety of triangle-closing mechanisms and show that a simple scheme, where a source node chooses an intermediate node uniformly from among its neighbors, and then the intermediate node does the same, has high likelihood.</p><p>Our model is simple and easy to implement. It precisely defines the network evolution process, and we also give parameter settings that allow others to generate networks at arbitrary scale or to take a current existing network and further evolve it. We show that our model produces realistic social network evolution following the true evolution of network properties such as clustering coefficient and diameter; our purely local model gives rise to accurate global properties.</p><p>Notation. Let N, E, and T denote the total number of nodes, edges, and the span of the data in days. Let Gt be a network composed from the earliest t edges, e1, . . . , et for t ¡Ê {1, . . . , E}. Let t(e) be the time when the edge e is created, let t(u) be the time when the node u joined the network, and let t k (u) be the time when the k th edge of the node u is created. Then at(u) = t ? t(u) denotes the age of the node u at time t. Let dt(u) denote the degree of the node u at time t and d(u) = dT (u). We use <ref type="bibr">[¡¤]</ref> to denote a predicate (takes value of 1 if expression is true, else 0).</p><p>Maximum-likelihood principle. The maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) principle can be applied to compare a family of parameterized models in terms of their likelihood of generating the observed data, and as a result, pick the "best" model (and parameters) to explain the data. To apply the likelihood principle, we consider the following setting: we evolve the network edge by edge,  <ref type="bibr">1294 7,550,955 30,682,028 30,682,028 30,682,028 15,201</ref>,596 49.55 1.14 1.04 <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Network dataset statistics. E b is the number of bidirectional edges, Eu is the number of edges in undirected network, E¦¤ is the number of edges that close triangles, % is the fraction of triangle-closing edges, ¦Ñ is the densification exponent (E(t) ¡Ø N (t) ¦Ñ ), and ¦Ê is the decay exponent (E h ¡Ø exp(?¦Êh)) of the number of edges E h closing h hop paths (see Section 5 and <ref type="figure">Figure 4)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref>   and for every edge that arrives into the network, we measure the likelihood that the particular edge endpoints would be chosen under some model. The product of these likelihoods over all edges will give the likelihood of the model. A higher likelihood means a "better" model in the sense that it offers a more likely explanation of the observed data. For numerical purposes, we use log-likelihoods.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Network T N E E b Eu E¦¤ % ¦Ñ ¦Ê FLICKR (</formula><p>Next we turn to our four networks and fit the function pe(d) ¡Ø d ¦Ó .

This suggests that high-degree nodes in LINKEDIN get super-preferential treatment. To summarize, even though there are minor differences in the exponents ¦Ó for each of the four networks, we can treat ¦Ó ¡Ö 1, meaning, the attachment is essentially linear.</p></div>

Also, selecting a destination appears more random than selecting a source -the maximum likelihood ¦Ó of the destination node (green curve) for models D and DR is shifted to the left when compared to the source node (red), which means the degree bias is weaker. Similarly, there is a stronger bias towards young nodes in selecting an edge's source than in selecting its destination. Based on the observations, we conclude that PA (model D) performs reasonably well compared to more sophisticated variants based on degree and age. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> plots the log-likelihoods under different models, as a function of ¦Ó . The red curve plots the log-likelihood of selecting a source node and the green curve for selecting the destination node of an edge.</p><p>In FLICKR the selection of destination is purely preferential: model D achieves the maximum likelihood at ¦Ó = 1, and model DA is very biased to model D, i.e., ¦Ó ¡Ö 1. Model A has worse likelihood but model DA improves the overall log-likelihood by around 10%. Edge attachment in DELICIOUS seems to be the most "random": model D has worse likelihood than model DR. Moreover the likelihood of model DR achieves maximum at ¦Ó = 0.5 suggesting that about 50% of the DELICIOUS edges attach randomly. Model A has better likelihood than the degree-based models, showing edges are highly biased towards young nodes. For ANSWERS, models D, A, and DR have roughly equal likelihoods (at the optimal choice of ¦Ó ), while model DA further improves the log-likelihood by 20%, showing some age bias. In LINKEDIN, age-biased models are worse than degree-biased models. We also note strong degree preferential bias of the edges. As in FLICKR, model DA improves the log-likelihood by 10%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">LOCALITY OF EDGE ATTACHMENT</head><p>Even though our analysis suggests that PA is a reasonable model for edge destination selection, it is inherently "non-local" in that edges are no more likely to form between nodes which already have friends in common. In this section we perform a detailed study of the locality properties of edge destination selection.</p><p>We first consider the following notion of edge locality: for each new edge (u, w), we measure the number of hops it spans, i.e., the length of the shortest path between nodes u and w immediately before the edge was created. In <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> we study the distribution of these shortest path values induced by each new edge for Gnp (with p = 12/n), PA, and the four social networks. (The isolated dot on the left counts the number of edges that connected previously disconnected components of the network.)</p><p>For Gnp most new edges span nodes that were originally six hops away, and then the number decays polynomially in the hops. In the PA model, we see a lot of long-range edges; most of them span four hops but none spans more than seven. The hop distributions corresponding to the four real-world networks look similar to one another, and strikingly different from both Gnp and PA. The    number of edges decays exponentially with the hop distance between the nodes (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for fitted decay exponents ¦Ê). This means that most edges are created locally between nodes that are close. The exponential decay suggests that the creation of a large fraction of edges can be attributed to locality in the network structure, namely most of the times people who are close in the network (e.g., have a common friend) become friends themselves. These results involve counting the number of edges that link nodes certain distance away. In a sense, this overcounts edges (u, w) for which u and w are far away, as there are many more distant candidates to choose from -it appears that the number of long-range edges decays exponentially while the number of longrange candidates grows exponentially. To explore this phenomenon, we count the number of hops each new edge spans but then normalize the count by the total number of nodes at h hops. More precisely, we compute Column E¦¤ in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> further illustrates this point by presenting the number of triangle-closing edges. FLICKR and LINKEDIN have the highest fraction of triangle-closing edges, whereas ANSWERS and DELICIOUS have substantially less such edges. Note that here we are not measuring the fraction of nodes participating in triangles. Rather, we unroll the evolution of the network, and for every new edge check to see if it closes a new triangle or not. pe(h) = t [et connects nodes at distance h in Gt?1] t (# nodes at distance h from the source node of et) .</p><note type="other">10 -3 10 4 10 -3 10 3 10 3 e (h) e (h</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Triangle-closing models</head><p>First, <ref type="figure">Figures 5(a) and (b)</ref> show the results for Gnp and PA models. (Again, the isolated dot at h = 0 plots the probability of a new edge connecting disconnected components.) In Gnp, edges are created uniformly at random, and so the probability of linking is independent of the number of hops between the nodes. In PA, due to degree correlations short (local) edges prevail. However, a non-trivial amount of probability goes to edges that span more than two hops. (Notice the logarithmic y-axis.)</p><p>Figures 5(c)-(f) show the plots for the four networks. Notice the probability of linking to a node h hops away decays doubleexponentially, i.e., pe(h) ¡Ø exp(exp(?h)), since the number of edges at h hops increases exponentially with h. This behavior is drastically different from both the PA and Gnp models. Also note that almost all of the probability mass is on edges that close lengthtwo paths. This means that edges are most likely to close triangles, i.e., connect people with common friends.</p><p>Given that such a high fraction of edges close triangles, we aim to model how a length-two path should be selected. We consider a scenario in which a source node u has decided to add an edge to some node w two hops away, and we are faced with various alternatives for the choice of node w. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> illustrates the setting. Edges arrive one by one and the simplest model to close a triangle (edge (u, w) in the figure) is to have u select a destination w randomly from all nodes at two hops from u.</p><p>To improve upon this baseline model we consider various models of choosing node w. We consider processes in which u first selects a neighbor v according to some mechanism, and v then selects a neighbor w according to some (possibly different) mechanism. The edge (u, w) is then created and the triangle (u, v, w) is closed. The selection of both v and w involves picking a neighbor of a node. We consider five different models to pick a neighbor v of u, namely, node v is chosen    ? random: uniformly at random, ? deg ¦Ó : proportional to degree raised to power ¦Ó , d(v) ¦Ó , ? com: prop. to the number of common friends c(u, v) with u, ? last ¦Ó : proportional to the time passed since v last created an edge raised to power ¦Ó ,</p><note type="other">deg 0.2 com last ?0.4 comlast ?0.4 random 13.6 13.9 14.3 16.1 15.7 deg 0</note><p>? comlast ¦Ó : proportional to the product of the number of common friends with u and the last activity time, raised to power ¦Ó . recency of activity by v, captured by last ¦Ó . By selecting nodes that have recently participated in a new edge with higher probability, we get another sizable improvement in the model likelihood. These two capture the finer details of network evolution.</p><p>In summary, while degree helps marginally, for all the networks, the random-random model gives a sizable chunk of the performance gain over the baseline (10%). Due its simplicity, we choose this as the triangle-closing model for the rest of the paper.</p><p>Note that the above methodology could be extended to edge creations other than triangle-closing. We chose to focus on the triangle-closing edges for two reasons. First, a high fraction of all edges created fall into this category, and hence an understanding of triangle-closing edges is an important first step towards understanding the overall network evolution. Second, with the exception of quite simplistic models, it is computationally infeasible to compute the likelihood at a distance greater than two hops as the number of nodes and possible paths increases dramatically.</p><p>As stated before, we can compose any two of these basic models to choose a two-hop neighbor, i.e., a way to close the triangle. For instance, the last 0.1 -com model will work as follows: u will employ the last 0.1 model to select node v, v will employ the com model to select node w, and then u will add an edge to w, closing the triangle (u, v, w). We consider all 25 five possible composite models for selecting a two-hop neighbor and evaluate them by the likelihood that the model generated all the edges that closed lengthtwo paths in the real network. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the percent improvement of various triangle-closing models over the log-likelihood of choosing a two-hop neighbor uniformly at random as a destination of the edge (the baseline). The simplest model, random-random, works remarkably well and has many desirable properties. It gives higher probability to nodes with more length-two paths, discounting each path by roughly 1/d(v). Moreover, it is also biased towards high-degree nodes, as they have multiple paths leading towards them.</p><p>The deg 1.0 -random model weighs each node w by roughly the number of length-two paths between u and w. However, we find that it performs worse than random-random. For the more general deg ¦Ó -random, the optimal value of ¦Ó varies from 0.1 to 0.3 over all the four networks, and this model provides meaningful improvements only for the ANSWERS network.</p><p>The com model considers the strength of a tie between u and v, which we approximate by the number of common friends c(u, v) of nodes u and v; the larger the value, the stronger the tie. By selecting v with probability proportional to c(u, v), we get a substantial gain in model likelihood. A factor that further improves the model is the</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Edge initiation</head><p>In the following we assume that the sequence and timing of node arrivals is given, and we model the process by which nodes initiate edges. We begin by studying how long a node remains active in the social network, and then during this active lifetime, we study the specific times at which the node initiates new edges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1">Node lifetime</head><p>To avoid truncation effects, we only consider those nodes whose last-created edge is in the first half of all edges in the data. Recall that the lifetime of a node u is a(u) = t d(u) (u) ? t1(u). We evaluate the likelihood of various distributions and observe that node lifetimes are best modeled by an exponential distribution, p (a) = ¦Ë exp(?¦Ëa). <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> gives the plot of the data and the exponential fits, where time is measured in days. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 5</ref>, the row corresponding to ¦Ë gives the values of fitted exponents. We note that the exponential distribution does not fit well the nodes with very short lifetimes, i.e., nodes that are invited into the network, create an edge and never return. But the distribution provides a very clean fit for nodes whose lifetime is more than a week.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">0   0   0  20  40  60  80  100  Gap parameter   0  20  40  60  80  100  Gap parameter   0  20  40  60  80  100  Gap parameter   Current degree, d</ref> Current degree, d</p><note type="other">power power law log stretched law exp. cutoff normal exp. 1 9.</note><p>Current degree, d <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Edge gap distribution: percent improvement of the log-likelihood at MLE over the exponential distribution.  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18   0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45</ref> Gap, ¦Ä(1) 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 Gap probability, p(¦Ä <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">(1))</ref> Gap, ¦Ä <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">(1)</ref> Time (weeks)  </p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Time (months) (c) ANSWERS (d) LINKEDIN (c) ANSWERS (d) LINKEDIN</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2">Time gap between the edges</head><p>Now that we have a model for the lifetime of a node u, we must model that amount of elapsed time between edge initiations from u. Let ¦Äu(d) = t d+1 (u) ? t d (u) be the time it takes for the node u with current degree d to create its (d+1)-st out-edge; we call ¦Äu(d) the edge gap. Again, we examine several candidate distributions to model edge gaps. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the percent improvement of the log-likelihood at the MLE over the exponential distribution. The best likelihood is provided by a power law with exponential cutoff:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">pg(¦Ä(d); ¦Á, ¦Â) ¡Ø ¦Ä(d) ?¦Á exp(?¦Â¦Ä(d)),</formula><p>where d is the current degree of the node. (Note that the distribution is neither exponential nor Poisson, as one might be tempted to assume.) We confirm these results in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, in which we plot the MLE estimates to gap distribution ¦Ä(1), i.e., distribution of times that it took a node of degree 1 to add the second edge. In fact, we find that all gaps distributions ¦Ä(d) are best modeled by a power law with exponential cut-off (Table 3 gives improvements in log-likelihoods for d = 1, . . . , 5 and the average for d = 1, . . . , 20.)</p><p>For each ¦Ä(d) we fit a separate distribution and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 9</ref> shows the evolution of the parameters ¦Á and ¦Â of the gap distribution, as a function of the degree d of the node. Interestingly, the power law exponent ¦Á(d) remains constant as a function of d, at almost the same value for all four networks. On the other hand, the exponential cutoff parameter ¦Â(d) increases linearly with d, and varies by an order of magnitude across networks; this variation models the extent to which the "rich get richer" phenomenon manifests in each network. This means that the slope ¦Á of power-law part remains constant, only the exponential cutoff part (parameter ¦Â) starts to kick in sooner and sooner. So, nodes add their (d + 1) Given the above observation, a natural hypothesis would be that nodes that will attain high degree in the network are in some way a priori special, i.e., they correspond to "more social" people who would inherently tend to have shorter gap times and enthusiastically invite friends at a higher rate than others, attaining high degree quickly due to their increased activity level. However, this phenomenon does not occur in any of the networks. We computed the correlation coefficient between ¦Ä(1) and the final degree d(u). The correlation values are ?0.069 for DELICIOUS, ?0.043 for FLICKR, ?0.036 for ANSWERS, and ?0.027 for LINKEDIN. Thus, there is almost no correlation, which shows that the gap distribution is independent of a node's final degree. It only depends on node lifetime, i.e., high degree nodes are not a priori special, they just live longer, and accumulate many edges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Node arrivals</head><p>Finally, we turn to the question of modeling node arrivals into the system. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows the number of users in each of our networks over time, and <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref> captures the best fits. FLICKR grows exponentially over much of our network, while the growth of other networks is much slower. DELICIOUS grows slightly superlinearly, LINKEDIN quadratically, and ANSWERS sublinearly. Given these wild variations we conclude the node arrival process needs to be specified in advance as it varies greatly across networks due to external factors.</p></div>

In Section 6.2, we analyzed the node arrival rates and showed that they are network-dependent and can be succinctly represented by a node arrival function N (t) that is either a polynomial or an exponential. In Section 6.1, we analyzed the node lifetimes and showed they are exponentially distributed with parameter ¦Ë. In Section 4.1, we argued that the destination of the first edge of a Network node is chosen proportional to its degree (i.e., preferentially attached). In Section 6.1, we analyzed the time gaps between edge creation at a node and showed they can be captured by a power law with exponential cutoff, with parameters ¦Á, ¦Â. In Section 5, we showed that most of the edges span two hops, and the simple random-random triangle-closing model works well. Motivated by these observations, we now present a complete network evolution model. Our model is parameterized by N (¡¤), ¦Ë, ¦Á, ¦Â, and operates as follows. Analogous to (1), we obtain the expected time gap E(¦Ä|d; ¦Á, ¦Â) for a node of degree d:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">N (t) FLICKR exp(0.25t) DELICIOUS 16t 2 + 3000t + 40000 ANSWERS ?284t 2 + 40000t ? 2500 LINKEDIN 3900t 2 + 76000t ? 130000</formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">E(¦Ä|d; ¦Á, ¦Â) = ¦£(2 ? ¦Á) ¦£(1 ? ¦Á) (¦Âd) ?1 .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Combining <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">(2)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">(3)</ref> otherwise it repeats from step 4.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">¦£(2 ? ¦Á) ¦£(1 ? ¦Á) (¦Âd) ?1 = ¦£(2 ? ¦Á) ¦£(1 ? ¦Á) ¦Â ?1 d ?1 ¡Ü a.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Gaps and power law degree distribution</head><p>We now show that our model, node lifetime combined with gaps, produces power law out-degree distribution.

We validate the accuracy of our modeling assumptions by empirically estimating the lifetime ¦Ë, and gap distribution ¦Á, ¦Â parameter values for each network. We then apply Theorem 1, which yields the power-law degree exponents produced by our model. Then we empirically measure the true power law degree exponents of the four networks and compare them to predictions of Theorem 1. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 5</ref> shows the results. Note the predicted degree exponents remarkably agree with the true exponents, validating our model.

In the first process (PA), we select two nodes preferentially, with probabilities proportional to their degrees, and add an edge. In the second process (RR), we use the random-random triangle-closing model, i.e., we first select a node preferentially and then pick a node two hops away using the random-random model.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">10   5   10   10   8   10   4   True  PA  RR   10   7   True  PA  RR   6   3   10   5   10   -1   10   10   4   10   2</ref>  : We take FLICKR network at first half of its evolution.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper we present a microscopic analysis of the edge-byedge evolution of four large online social networks. The use of the maximum-likelihood principle allows us to quantify the bias of new edges towards the degree and age of nodes, and to objectively compare various models such as preferential attachment. In fact, our work is the first to quantify the amount of preferential attachment that occurs in networks.</p><p>Our study shows that most new edges span very short distances, typically closing triangles. Motivated by these observations, we develop a complete model of network evolution, incorporating node arrivals, edge initiation, and edge destination selection processes. While node arrivals are mostly network-specific, the edge initiation process can be captured by exponential node lifetimes and a "gap" model based on a power law with exponential cutoff. We arrive at an extremely simple yet surprisingly accurate description of the edge destination selection in real networks. Our model of network evolution can be used to generate arbitrary-sized synthetic networks that closely mimic the macroscopic characteristics of real social networks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Probability pe(d) of a new edge e choosing a destination at a node of degree d.</figDesc></figure>
