			<abstract>
				<p>Cluster analysis of gene-wide expression data from DNA microarray hybridization studies has proved to be a useful tool for identifying biologically relevant groupings of genes and constructing gene regulatory networks. The motivation for considering mutual information is its capacity to measure a general dependence among gene random variables. We propose a novel clustering strategy based on minimizing mutual information among gene clusters. Simulated annealing is employed to solve the optimization problem. Bootstrap techniques are employed to get more accurate estimates of mutual information when the data sample size is small. Moreover, we propose to combine the mutual information criterion and traditional distance criteria such as the Euclidean distance and the fuzzy membership metric in designing the clustering algorithm. The performances of the new clustering methods are compared with those of some existing methods, using both synthesized data and experimental data. It is seen that the clustering algorithm based on a combined metric of mutual information and fuzzy membership achieves the best performance.

Due to the large number of genes and the high complexity of biological networks, clustering is a useful exploratory technique for the analysis of gene expression data. Clustering has been used in a number of studies to obtain a global, unsupervised perspective on the similarity of expression pro les <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ben-Dor et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bittner et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Claverie, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dougherty 148 ZHOU ET AL. et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Eisen et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Iyer, 1999)</ref>. A wide range of clustering algorithms has been proposed to analyze gene expression data, including hierarchical clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Eisen et al., 1998)</ref>, self-organizing maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Tamayo et al., 1999</ref>), K-means <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Tavazoie et al., 1999</ref>), graph-theoretic approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ben-Dor et al., 1999)</ref>, support vector machines ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brown et al., 2000</ref>) and fuzzy C-means ). Successes in application have been reported for many clustering approaches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ghosh and Chinnaiyan, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Horimoto and Toh, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lukashin and Fuchs, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Strehl and Ghosh, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Xing and Karp, 2001;</ref>) but so far no single method has emerged as the method of choice in the gene expression analysis community.</p><p>In this paper, we develop a new gene clustering strategy based on minimizing the mutual information among clusters. Pertinent to our approach is a study based on computing the mutual information for all pairs of genes and then choosing a threshold of the mutual information to create clusters of genes encompassing those with mutual information higher than the threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Butte and Hohane, 2000</ref>). These have been similar treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chen and Church, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Friedman et al., 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Friedman et al., , 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">D'Haeseleer et al., 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">D'Haeseleer et al., , 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Michaels et al., 1998</ref>). These works are based on pairwise mutual information (PMI) and thus essentially only explore the marginal distributions of the multi-dimensional data. Our clustering strategy is based on minimizing the mutual information of the variables among clusters, and hence it fully explores the underlying joint probability distribution of the data. Bootstrap techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Zoubir and Boashash, 1998)</ref> are employed to obtain more accurate estimates of the mutual information for the typically small sets of data samples. Data are assumed to be truncated ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al., 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Mutual-information-based clustering minimizes the statistical correlation among clusters, whereas the traditional K-means and fuzzy C-means algorithms minimize the total variance within different clusters. It is natural to consider combining these two paradigms to obtain more effective clustering techniques. To this end, we propose two clustering algorithms based on a combined mutual information and Euclidean distance criterion and a combined mutual information and fuzzy membership criterion. The performances of the new clustering methods are compared with that of some existing methods, using both synthesized data and experimental data.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formulate the new clustering strategy based on mutual information minimization. We also discuss the bootstrap procedure for estimating the mutual information from a small dataset, as well as the simulated annealing procedure for solving the corresponding optimization problem. In Section 3, we propose two additional clustering methods based on combining the mutual information metric and the conventional Euclidean distance or the fuzzy membership metric. In Section 4, we provide performance comparisons of the above clustering methods using synthesized data. In Section 5, we present clustering results on gene microarray measurement data. Section 6 contains the conclusions.</p></div>

Shannon's information theory provides a suitable formalism for quantifying such a concept. The entropy of a gene expression pattern is a measure of the uncertainty information content in that pattern.

Therefore, we normalize I .XI Y / by the maximal entropy of each of the contributing sequences, giving a high value for highly correlated sequences, independent of the individual entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Michaels et al., 1998)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">N I .XI Y / D I .XI Y / maxfH .X/; H .Y /g :<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Unlike the Euclidean distance, this measure also recognizes negatively and nonlinearly correlated data sets as proximal <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Michaels et al., 1998</ref>).</p><p>The probabilities in (6) can be estimated by the corresponding histograms, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P .X D x i ; Y D y j / ?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Clustering based on pairwise mutual information</head><p>Here we describe a threshold clustering algorithm based on pairwise mutual information (PMI). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Heyer et al. (1999)</ref>, a threshold clustering algorithm is developed using jackknife correlation. We apply this idea to the pairwise mutual information-based cluster analysis. The PMI works as follows: a candidate cluster is formed by starting with the rst gene and grouping the gene that has smallest mutual-information-based distance with the target gene. The distance is dee ned as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">d.XI Y / D 1 ? N I .XI Y / D 1 ? I .XI Y / maxfH .X/; H .Y /g :<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Each iteration adds the gene that has a minimal distance to the target gene to the cluster. The process continues until no gene can be added without surpassing the distance threshold. A second candidate cluster is formed by starting with the second gene and repeating the same procedure. Note that all genes are made available to the second gene, that is, the genes from the rst candidate cluster are not removed from consideration. The process continues for all genes. The largest candidate cluster is selected and retained.</p><p>The genes in the largest candidate cluster are removed from the whole gene set, and the entire procedure is repeated on the smaller gene set. For the predee ned cluster number case, K in this study, when the number of clusters reaches K, add all the remaining genes to the last cluster. In this algorithm, the threshold is chosen as the mean of the distances of all gene pairs, or chosen empirically <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Butte and Hohane, 2000</ref>).</p></div>

The basic procedure involves a cooling procedure, in which a temperature parameter starts out high and is gradually lowered until the system is frozen. At each temperature, the state is perturbed many times, which avoids the limitation of being initialization dependent.

When the sample size is large, the mutual information can be estimated accurately, and then the mutual-information minimization clustering exhibits optimality.

In order to enhance the clustering performance under such a condition, we propose to combine the mutual information criterion and the traditional distance criterion in designing the clustering algorithm. </p></div>

Hence, the two clusters are .x 1 ; x 2 / and .x 3 ; x 4 /. The probabilities used in the Bernoulli distribution are 1=2 n for each state, where n is the number of variables. In the rst simulation, we vary the sample size M and perform the cluster analysis using the above eight algorithms. The results are the average of 100 simulations. The value of?isof?of?is set as 0.5 empirically in this paper. Since the mutual information estimation will become imprecise with an increasing number of gene variables, ? should become small to decrease the effect from the imprecise mutual information. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> show the clustering results using different sample sizes. It is seen that the MI method always outperforms the fuzzy C-means, the K-means, the linkage, the biclustering, and the pairwise MI methods. The combined mutual-information and fuzzy membership-based clustering algorithm has the best clustering accuracy. The MIK method has similar performance as the MI method. The MI-based clustering methods become more accurate as the sample size increases, whereas the fuzzy C-means, the K-means, the linkage, and the biclustering algorithm are insensitive to the sample size. Note that the biclustering algorithm is the algorithm 1 (single node deletion) proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chen and Church (2000)</ref>, where the parameter ¡À (maximum acceptable mean squared residue score) is set as 0:1. Next, we x the sample size to M D 30 and compare the seven clustering algorithms (not including the biclustering algorithm since it is for two-cluster clustering) under different numbers of variables and clusters as in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. The data are generated according to</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">p.X 1 ; X 2 ; ? ? ? ; X K / D p.X 1 /p.X 2 / ? ? ? p.X K /;<label>(23)</label></formula><p>where X 1 ; X 2 ; ? ? ? ; X K are the K clusters. The MI method outperforms the fuzzy C-means, the K-means, the linkage, and the pairwise MI methods. The MIK method has a similar performance as the MI method. Again, the combined MIF clustering algorithm has the best performance. Note that algorithm performances degrade substantially as the number of genes increases. This is to be expected and can be signii cantly recti ed by replicating experiments ). The degree of degradation depends on the distributions governing the data according to <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>. Performance holds up better for fuzzy C-means if the distributions are separated and their variances small and holds up better for mutual-information clustering if the mutual information within the individual distributions is high in comparison to the mutual information between individual distributions. </p></div>

Both the original and reduced sets are available at gspsnap.tamu.edu/gspweb/zxb/glioma_ zxb/glioma_web.htm, along with the clusters determined by the algorithms.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this study, we have proposed a novel clustering strategy based on minimizing mutual information among gene clusters. Simulated annealing was employed to solve the optimization problem. Bootstrap techniques were employed to get more accurate estimation of mutual information when the data sample size is small. Moreover, we proposed to combine the mutual information criterion and traditional distance criteria, such as the Euclidean distance and the fuzzy membership metric, in designing the clustering algorithm. The performance of the new clustering methods has been compared with that of some existing methods, using both synthesized data and experimental data. The clustering algorithm based on a combined metric of mutual information and fuzzy membership has achieved the best performance.</p><p>Note that the clustering algorithm (named "cluster ensembles") of combining multiple partitions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Strehl and Ghosh, 2002</ref>) is quite different from our methods. There, given a dataset, assume there are different partitions (say, obtained by some clustering algorithms); then the cluster ensembles method is to nd a partition of the dataset that is an optimal combination of the different partitions. The mutual information dee ned in cluster ensembles is based on different partitions, and it just depends on the numbers of elements in the clusters of the partitions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Algorithm 1 (Basic bootstrap procedure for mutual information estimation) . ?</head><label>.</label><figDesc>For n D 1; 2; ? ? ? ; P -Resample: Draw a random sample Z ¡è n of M values from Z; -Calculate the estimated mutual information N I n based on the resample Z ¡è n ; ?
