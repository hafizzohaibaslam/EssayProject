			<abstract>
				<p>Infohabitants of the connected information systems include individuals, organizations, smart appliances, smart buildings, and other smart systems, as well as virtual entities acting on their behalf. They can best be represented by software agents. Hence, realistic cognitive abilities of software agents such as influence of personality to decision making and problem solving is of practical computational importance. In this article, two characteristics are added to software agents with personality: dynamic personality and the relationships of personality trait openness with both problem solving ability and cognitive complexity. The last characteristic of openness leads to its impact to dynamic modification of problem solving ability. In this article, an implementation of a fuzzy agent with personality is realized in Java environment to show personality descriptors, personality factors, personality style, and problem solving success consequently. Furthermore, a prototype system is presented to update personality facets and respective personality trait openness which can affect problem solving ability.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Simulation of human behavior has been an interesting and important area of research and application for a long time <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cohn, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dutton &amp; Starbuck, 1971)</ref>. The extensive bibliography and systematic index provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dutton and Starbuck (1971)</ref> covers even earlier studies. Currently, simulation of human behavior has gained the focus of attention for several applications such as representing human behavior in military simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Pew &amp; Mavor, 1998)</ref>, Web-based simulation of agent behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Campos &amp; Hill, 1998)</ref>, and agent simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Yilmaz, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The concept of infohabitants enlarges the domain of application of human behavior simulation to a more general area, i.e., simulation of intelligent entities. ''Infohabitants of the connected information systems include individuals, organizations, smart appliances, smart buildings, and other smart systems, as well as virtual entities acting on their behalf'' <ref type="bibr">(O ： ren, 2002</ref>). Infohabitants can best be represented by software agents. Hence, realistic cognitive abilities of software agents such as influence of personality to decision making and problem solving is of practical computational importance.</p><p>A concise taxonomy of taxonomies of personalities is given at the site of personality project (Personality Project). Two excellent references for personality knowledge are <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Costa and McCrae (1992)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Acton (2001)</ref>. They present a five-factor model and an extensive table outlining the research on personality by over 30 researchers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Howard (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Howard and</ref><ref type="bibr">Howard (2001a, 2001b</ref>) are also good references. The state-of-the art of psychological knowledge about the personality types is distilled by O ： ren and  to provide a basis for the specification of fuzzy agents with dynamic personality for the simulation of human behavior.</p><p>In contemporary psychology, personality is specified as a function of 30 attributeseach of which called personality facet. The personality facets are clustered in five groups -each called a personality trait (or personality factor). The first evidence for the five personality factors was published in 1949, when <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fiske (1949)</ref> reported being unable to produce the 16-factor structure claimed before him. Instead, he found a five factor solution. The report of his findings sat in relative obscurity until the early 1960s, when <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Norman (1963)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Borgotta (1964), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Smith (1967)</ref> approached the same research question with different instruments. Each, however, reached the same conclusion: Five factors provided the best account to the data. During the decade of the 80s, there has been a virtual explosion of work on this topic. Data from earlier studies have been reanalyzed in new ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Digman &amp; Takemoto-Chock, 1981)</ref>. New and diverse samples have also been collected, for example, teachers' ratings of children <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Digman &amp; Inouye, 1986)</ref>, self-report and peer ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(McCrae &amp; Costa, 1987)</ref> and recently the relationship between Internet usage and the Big Five <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Landers &amp; Lounsbury, 2006</ref>).</p><p>Agents are used for the simulation of human behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Yilmaz, 2005)</ref>. Agents with personality are software agents which can represent human personality traits. They can represent human personality at coarse grain or fine grain levels. At coarse grain level, they can represent some or all relevant characteristics such as openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and negative emotions in line with the five-factor personality theories to model human behavior. At fine grain level, the facets of each personality trait are also represented. Personality knowledge is often expressed in terms of linguistic variables that can describe concepts that usually have vague and fuzzy values <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Durkin, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Several studies exist on agents with personality. For example, Rizzo, Veloso, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Miceli, and Cesta (1997)</ref> describe work aimed at realizing believable agents that perform helping behaviors influenced by their own personalities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Martinez-Miranda and Aldea (2002)</ref> describe an agent model that simulates the human behavior in a team. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Schmidt (2002)</ref> presents the framework of the PECS (Physic, Emotion, Cognition, and Social Status) architecture where a system-theoretical methodology is used for specifying agents' personality traits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allbeck and Badler (2002)</ref> present work toward representing agent behaviors modified by personality and emotion. To this end, they describe a parameterized action representation (PAR) for building future behaviors into autonomous agents and controlling the animation parameters that portray personality, mood, and affect in an embodied agents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Egges, Kshirsagar, and Magnenat-Thalmann (2003)</ref> describe a generic model for personality, mood and emotion simulation for conversational virtual humans. El-Nasr, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Yen, and Ioerger (2000)</ref> propose a new computational model of emotions that can be incorporated into intelligent agents and other complex, interactive programs. Martinez-Miranda and Aldea (2005) present recent work related to the addition of emotions to intelligent agents to make them more human-like. Rousseau and Hayes-Roth (1997) report work on actors with flexible personalities.</p><p>In this article, the aim is to lay down the basis for advanced software agents to represent infohabitants in connected information systems. More specifically, we aim to have agents with personality where the personality traits can be modified dynamically based on possible changes of the relevant personality facets and implement a pilot system to explore the influence of cognitive complexity which can be modified dynamically (as a function of the six facets of the personality trait openness) on problem solving.</p><p>The plan of organization for the rest of the paper is as follows: personality knowledge and dynamic personality are presented in Section 2. Cognitive complexity is given in Section 3. Some fuzzy rules to show personality descriptors, relationship of cognitive complexity and problem solving are explored in Section 4. Finally, the class diagram and the outputs of the program that is implemented in Java environment are presented in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Personality knowledge and dynamic personality</head><p>The term personality refers to the sets of predictable behaviors by which people are recognized and identified. These sets of behaviors go by the name of personality traits or factors. The five personality factors are also referred to as ''the big five'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Howard, 2000</ref>). The value of each personality factor is determined by the values of its six facets. The five clusters of personality factors are also referred to by letter designation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Acton, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Howard &amp; Howard, 2001a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, 2001b</ref>. Acton refers to them as the OCEAN model. In the OCEAN model, the letters stands for the following meanings:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">O:</formula><p>Openness (culture, originality, or intellect) C:</p><p>Conscientiousness (consolidation or will to achieve) E: Extraversion A:</p><p>Agreeableness (or accommodation) N:</p><p>Negative emotionality (need for stability or neuroticism)</p><p>Each trait has six facets <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Acton, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Howard, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Howard &amp; Howard, 2001a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, 2001b</ref>. The values of the personality facets may be modified according to the desired personality traits <ref type="bibr">(Howard, 2000, pp. 756-761)</ref>. The change of the person-ality traits by age are also explained by <ref type="bibr">Howard (2000, p. 439)</ref>. The modifications of the values of personality facets can be used to re-evaluate the personality of an agent to allow personality updates and hence representation of dynamic personality. Once, such a discontinuity is processed, the behavior of the fuzzy agent can be based on the updated personality.</p><p>At fine grain level, a realistic refinement of human personality representation is dynamic personality to take into account the variability of personality traits based on the changes in corresponding personality facets. When at least any one of the 30 facets changes its value, the personality may be affected and personality update can take place, i.e., the personality should be re-evaluated with the implications of the corresponding personality trait. Personality update corresponds to a discontinuity and model update. For a generalized view and implications of discontinuity and model update see <ref type="bibr">O ： ren (1991)</ref>. Series of personality updates would also allow realization of evolutionary models of personality.</p><p>A systematic presentation of human personality knowledge, including dynamic personality processable in fuzzy logic for human behavior simulation is given by O ： ren and Ghasem-Aghaee, . Fuzzy agents are agents that can perform qualitative uncertainty reasoning with incomplete and fuzzy knowledge in some environment that contains linguistic variables. (Fuzzy) agents with dynamic personality are (fuzzy) agents with personality where personality knowledge is updateable. The effect of cognitive complexity in decision making within complex situations has been known since a long time <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Athey, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">O ： ren, 1978)</ref> and the relationship of cognitive complexity and one of the personality traits, i.e., openness is also well accepted <ref type="bibr">(McCrae, 2000, Chap. 12)</ref>. These facts lead to tying cognitive complexity with personality update in fuzzy agents with dynamic personality <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ghasem-Aghaee &amp; O ： ren, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Seck, Frydman, Giambiasi, O ： ren, &amp; Yilmaz, 2005</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Cognitive complexity</head><p>In most decision making processes, ability of coping with complexity is a fundamental issue and influences the quality of the decisions in problem solving. As posited by <ref type="bibr">Tenny- son and Breuer (2002)</ref> ''Higher-order thinking strategies involve three cognitive processes: differentiation, integration, and construction of knowledge. The first two processes occur primarily in the retrieval system of memory while the third further involves the other components of the entire cognitive system. . . . The operational term for the retrieval system functions of differentiation and integration is cognitive complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Schroder, 1971)</ref>. Cognitive complexity, as contrasted to intelligence, is an ability that can be developed and improved with direct instructional intervention. Differentiation is defined as a two-fold cognitive process as follows: (a) the ability to understand a given situation; and (b) the ability to apply appropriate criteria by which to select necessary knowledge from storage. Integration is the process of forming new schema(s) from selected knowledge. Construction is the process to form new knowledge by employing the total cognitive system.'' Based on Athey's work (1976), O ： ren (1978) elaborated on the importance of increasing cognitive complexity of an individual (or to assign another person with higher cognitive complexity) to increase the effectiveness in coping with complex situations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> shows different levels of information processing of an individual depending on the situational complexity. For a low situational complexity, the individual may need to have low level of information processing to cope with the situation. If the situational complexity increases, his/her information processing level may also increase. However, for each individual there is a critical point beyond which the level of processed information hence the individual's information processing effectiveness is decreased. After the critical point, an increase in the situational complexity may worsen the individual's ability to cope with complexity, by causing a decrease in his/her level of information processing.</p><p>The information processing curves of two types of individuals, i.e., high and low cognitive complexity individuals are compared in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Two important points are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>: first, c h , the critical point of high cognitive complexity individual is higher than c l , critical point of low cognitive complexity individual. Thus increasing the cognitive complexity of an individual -within the applicable limits of course -may increase the range of situational complexity within which he/she can perform effectively. Or depending on the task, it may be advisable to assign an individual with cognitive complexity commensurate with the task. Second, for a given situational complexity s, the level of information processed for a high cognitive complexity individual i h is greater than i l which corresponds to a low cognitive complexity individual.</p><p>As stated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Streufert and Swezey (1986)</ref>, ''Complexity refers to the extent to which an individual or organization differentiates and integrates an event. Differentiation is the number of distinctions or separate elements (i.e., factors, variables) into which an event is analyzed. Integration refers to the connections or relationships among these elements. Persons who are high in cognitive complexity are able to analyze (i.e., differentiate) a situation into many constituent elements, and then explore connections and potential rela- <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Comparison of the information processing curves of two types of individuals. tionships among the elements; they are multidimensional in their thinking. Complexity theory assumes that the more an event can be differentiated and the parts considered in novel relationships, the more refined the response and successful the solution. While less complex people can be taught a complex set of detailed distinctions for a specific context, high complexity people are very flexible in creating new distinctions in new situations.'' Additional characteristics of high and low cognitive complexity individuals (with relevance to managers) and based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Streufert and Swezey (1986)</ref> are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Cognitive complexity is related with openness. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, depending the three levels (i.e. low, medium, or high) of the openness, three types of personalities are identified as preserver, moderate, and explorer. Each facet has a weight factor. In the determination of the overall value of a trait, the weighted value of each facet is computed by multiplying its measured value by the weight factor. The dominant facet determines the value of the trait. There is a need to find a way to represent the continuum of openness which can allow a person to be for example, 0.30 preserver and 0.70 explorer.</p><p>It is indicated in Chapter 12 of the handbook of emotional intelligence that ''openness has also been associated with other cognitive or quasi-cognitive variables, including moral  reasoning, cognitive complexity and wisdom <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">'' (McCrae, 2000</ref>). The relationship of cognitive complexity and openness as a personality trait justifies applicability of personality update concept of dynamic personality to cognitive complexity. The personality facets which affect openness are: fantasy, aesthetics, feelings, actions, ideas, and values. The dominant facet, i.e., the one having the largest weighted value determines openness. Any value change in any of the personality facets affecting openness may induce a personality update and change in the value of openness to affect the cognitive complexity of the individual.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Fuzzy rules</head><p>Personality knowledge is often expressed in terms of linguistic variables that can describe concepts that usually have vague and fuzzy values <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Durkin, 1994)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zadeh (1975)</ref> has pointed out the incompatibility principle, which states that ''complexity and precision are incompatible properties. Thus the conventional numerical-based approaches are inadequate to model human knowledge in complex processes,'' like human personality traits. Sophisticated knowledge and rich human experience can be incorporated into the fuzzy knowledge base in an almost natural language <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Yan, Ryan, &amp; Power, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>The following fuzzy rules, in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>, show the relationship of cognitive complexity of an individual and associated problem solving ability. In these fuzzy rules, the degree of problem solving success is determined by the value of problem complexity (defined by the user) and the value of cognitive complexity (defined by the value of openness). We have implemented these fuzzy rules, such that, after fuzzy inferencing and defuzzification, the degree of the agent problem solving success is determined. Due to space limitation, we report a few sample fuzzy rules in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. Some fuzzy rules to represent personality descriptors based on the values of the personality facets of openness are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>.</p><p>To save space only some sample rules are given. O_fantasy denotes the characteristic (descriptor) of the fantasy facet of the Openness trait of personality. A more general way to determine the value of a trait is to consider the degree (value) of a trait, which is the degree (value) of the current dominant facet (i.e., facet which has largest weighted value). The degree of a facet is its weighted value (equal to the product of its measured value by its weight factor as determined from factor analysis). This way of determination also covers the special cases where all facets have same values. El-Nasr and Skubic (1998) also propose that the agent acts on the emotion with the highest intensity and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gadanho and Hallam (2000)</ref> use the current dominant emotion. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> shows an example for the determination of the value of a trait from the dominant values of its facets, let's consider the weighted values of the facets as follows:</p><p>(Low &lt; 45, 45 medium 55, high P 55). Then the fuzzy rule follows:</p><p>5. An implementation <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> shows the class diagram of the program. Each class contains the main attributes and the methods (class name at the top, attributes at the middle, and methods at the bottom). For implementation of designed personality fuzzy rules, it has required to implement fuzzy concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Durkin, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lefteri, 1996)</ref>. These concepts have been defined as fuzzy set  class, fuzzy rule class and fuzzy rule base class. Fuzzy set class is the base of this implementation and has been used in fuzzy rule class. Fuzzy rule class has been used in fuzzy rule base class and then, for each cluster of personality rules, a fuzzy rule base has been created. The brief explanation of each class is as follows:</p><p>1. Fuzzy set class (FuzzySet.java): A fuzzy set can be defined, using personality factor based on the values of the facets and definition of the membership functions that reasonably map the personality traits value into their corresponding belief values. These values have been used as the attributes of fuzzy set class. We measure the degree of membership of each value by evoking the ''MembershipDegree'' method of this class. 2. Fuzzy rule class (FuzzyRule.java): This class uses fuzzy set class. By definition of a fuzzy rule object, it is possible to insert antecedent and conclusion parts to each rule by evoking ''AddAntecedent'' and ''AddConclusion'' methods of this class. Antecedent and conclusion are two attributes of this class. The method of ''TestRuleMatch'' has been used for verification whether the rule has been fired or not. This method assigns ''True'' or ''False'' to the ''fire rule'' attribute of this class. If the antecedent of rule is complex, the AND operator will be applied between the parts of antecedents. For calculation the degree of ''fire rule (DOF)'', the ''minimum'' technique ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lefteri, 1996</ref>) has been applied. After calculation of DOF (via ''TestRuleMatch'' method), we can calculate the output fuzzy set by evoking ''GetOutputSet'' method. This method, evaluates the fuzzy relation between antecedent and conclusion of each rule, using ''Larsen Product'' technique ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lefteri, 1996)</ref>. 3. Fuzzy rule base class (FuzzyRuleBase.java): By creating an instance of this class, it is possible to define a cluster of rules, and doing fuzzification, fuzzy inference and defuzzification on the rules, we can finally calculate the output results. Some important attributes of this class are an array of fuzzy rules, the number of fuzzy rules and the number of fired fuzzy rules after inference. We can add the predefined fuzzy rules to a fuzzy rule base, by evoking the method of ''Add Rule''. The ''fuzzification'' method, fuzzificates the input value of the rule base. The method of ''Inference'' of rule base, catches the fuzzificated values and then obtains the DOF of each rule by evoking ''TestRuleMatch'' method of that rule. If DOF is higher than zero, the rule will be considered as a fired rule. The method of ''defuzzification'' can be used for calculation of final result. For this purpose, this method applies the fuzzy centroid technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lefteri, 1996)</ref>. For each of four clusters of designed fuzzy personality rules in this paper, we have defined an instance of fuzzy rule base class. The software is implemented in Java environment and contains an agent with dynamic personality. Each facet has a weight factor. In the determination of the overall value of a trait, the weighted value of each facet is    computed by multiplying its measured value by the weight factor. The dominant facet determines the value of the trait. The outputs in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figs. 4-7</ref> show personality descriptors, personality factors, personality style, and problem solving success consequently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>Model update is an important modeling concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Yilmaz &amp; O ： ren, 2004</ref>). Dynamic personality is an aspect of model update and allows -as clarified in another article ) -changes of personality traits based on the changes of the relevant personality facets. Representation of dynamic personality in fuzzy agents was presented by Ghasem-Aghaee and O ： ren <ref type="bibr">(2003)</ref>. In this article, we pointed out to the fact that openness, as a personality trait, is related with cognitive complexity and hence updates on openness can have implications on cognitive complexity and to the decision making ability of the agents in problem solving. An implementation of a fuzzy agent is reported to represent the effect of modifications of facets of openness to the ability to cope complexity.
