				<p>This paper introduces a community-based approach to facilitate the generation of high-quality recommendations by leveraging the preferences of communities of similar users in preference networks. The proposed approach combines the idea of traditional recommendation systems and identification of network structures to explore context specific inter-personalised trust relationships among users. From the experimental results, we claim that the proposed approach can provide more accurate recommendations to individuals in a preference network.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Recommendation systems are widely implemented in many application domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Technologies that have been popularly applied to recommendation systems include the user-based approach, the item-based approach and the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (KNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Firstly, user-based collaborative filtering predicts an active user's evaluation criteria for a particular item based on rating records from users with similar profiles. Similarly, item-based recommendation algorithms use the similarity between items instead of users. Thirdly, correlation and similarity between items or users are utilised to as measurement of proximity to form a neighborhood scheme. However, these approaches only assume single and homogeneous trust relationships between users or similarity, and evaluate item similarity from a simplistic world view.</p><p>Communities reflect topological relationships between elements of the underlying system and represent functional entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. However, most of existing researches do not take the available feedback rating in the system into consideration to improve the community detection process. Actually, feedback ratings, which are one kind of user-generated content, are critical for perceiving item opinions according to users' preferences through sentiment analysis and opinion mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Therefore, in the proposed approach in this paper, we take feedback ratings into account which can provide better supervision to the community detection process in the preference networks by providing rich context information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Problem Definition</head><p>In this section, we formally define our problem and introduce several related concepts. We consider a preference network which consists of an item set, i.e., I = {item 1 , item 2 , item 3 , ..., item n }, and a user set, i.e., U = {u 1 , u 2 , u 3 , ..., u m }.Many to many relationships among users and items exist, namely, a group of users can collect many different items, and a set of items can be collected by many different users.</p><p>Given a preference network consisting of m users and n items, we can have a m ℅ n user-item rating matrix R. Each entry r m,n in R represents the feedback rating of item item n provided by user u m . The default value of r m,n is 0, which means that u m does not have any previous interactive experience with item n .</p><p>In the proposed approach, an item with a non-zero rating value is regarded as an distinct object, and a preference network can have one object set.</p><p>Definition 1: The object set O in a preference network is a set of objects. Each object o 而 itemn =&lt; item i , 而 x &gt;, where item i ﹋ I, and 而 x denotes the particular rating value for each item i .</p><p>Once a pair of users, e.g., u j and u k , provide a same rating 而 x for an item item n , the object o 而x itemn is connected to both u j and u k . In other words, the edges between users are constructed by objects, vice versa. Hence, we can model a preference network as a bipartite network consisting of two exclusive kinds of vertices representing users and their objects. In addition, edges which link vertices belonging to different sets, i.e., U , O, respectively. Therefore, we can have the following formal definition for a preference network. Definition 2: A preference network is represented as a bipartite network with three-tuple: CG =&lt; U, O, E &gt;, where U is the user vertex set involved in the preference network CG, O is the set of object vertex set that users have usually interacted with particular items by giving particular feedback ratings, and E is the edge set representing interactions that exist in CG. E = E U O , where</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E U O = {(u j , o 而x item k )|u j ﹋ U, o 而x item k ﹋ O}.</formula><p>In terms of edges linking two vertices from different vertex sets, there is no connection among vertices in the same vertex set. Upon the completion of particular interaction, the system will update the interaction record IR related with the user, item and object information. If u i inquires the potential quality of item j , and u i lacks of previous interaction experience with item j , the system will generate an item enquiry IE containing the information of u i and item j , i.e., IE =&lt; u i , item j &gt;. IE.item j represents which item a user IE.u i enquires about.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Trust Estimation Protocol</head><p>The structure and interaction protocol of the community-based trust estimation approach is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. There are six modules in the protocol, i.e., the Reply Module, the Interaction Record Database, the User Criteria Clustering Module, the Facet Object Set Generation Module, the Prediction Retrieval Module and the Trust Calculation Module. In this section, we will introduce the overall process in detail.</p><p>Firstly, once a user (e.g., u i ) completes an interaction between an item (e.g., item j ), the Reply Module updates the interaction record IR related with u i , item j and o 而x itemj . The feedback ratings on diverse items given by users are stored as interaction records and sent to the Interaction Record Database. Then, based on the records in the Interaction Record Database, the User Criteria Clustering Module and the Facet Object Set Generation Module will detect user communities and object communities, respectively.</p><p>The objective of the User Criteria Clustering Module is to cluster users into hierarchical communities according to the user-generated ratings of items. The user criteria clusters generation is based on hierarchical clustering organises users as a hierarchy of nested partitions. Similarly, the purpose of the Facet Object Set Generation Module is to generate object communities based on the hierarchical user criteria clustering tree from the User Criteria Clustering Module. This module transforms the item with specific rating values to objects. Based on the rating interactions between users and items, objects are partitioned into communities on different levels corresponding to a user criteria clustering tree in an optimization phase by link analysis.</p><p>The objective of the Prediction Retrieval Module module is to generate a quality prediction for the required item IE.item j based on the preference of required user IE.u i . It will search for all facet object sets which include objects related to the required item IE.item j . Then, the Facet Object Set Generation Module will pass the facet object sets which satisfies the item enquiry IE to the Trust Calculation Module. Trust Calculation Module will compare the objects with the enquirer's previous interaction records and return the rating value of the object regarding the required item IE.item j in the facet object set which obtained the most confidence to user IE.u i .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Hierarchical Community Structure</head><p>In this section, a four-step trust mining algorithm is proposed to partition three kinds of elements, i.e., item, user, object, into different community (subnetwork) structures, called user criteria cluster, object community and facet object set, respectively. A community detection approach is also introduced in this section, which combines user criteria clustering and link analysis for objects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">User Community</head><p>The user community evolution is based on the idea that users in the same community are more likely to have common preferences, they are more likely to have similar expectations about a certain group of items. In this approach, items are regarded as random variables and mutual information is capable of measuring general dependence among them. The entropy of a user rating pattern is a measurement of the uncertainty in the feedback value given on items. It can be calculated by using Equation 1:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">n H(uj) = ? P (Ru j = rj,i) log P (Ru j = rj,i), (1) i=1</formula><p>where n is the number of possible items which u m can rate. Higher entropy of users for item variables means that their selection and rating pattern levels are more randomly distributed <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Mutual information describes the amount of common feedback rating given by both users. Thus, it can be used to derive distance measure quantifying the similarity of pairs of user selection and rating pattern. The mutual information between user u j and u k is defined by Equation 2:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">I(uj, u k ) = H(uj) + H(u k ) ? H(uj, u k ).<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The smaller values of mutual information I(u j , u k ) is, the larger difference between pair of user selection and rating patterns. However, mutual information is not bounded, so it would not be a suitable distance measurement for itself. Therefore, we transform the mutual information into a bounded mutual-informationbased distance by normalizing it (See Equation 3).</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">D(uj, u k ) = 1 ? I(uj, u k ) max(H(uj), H(u k )) .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>D(u j , u k ) denotes the preference similarity between a pair of users. It equals to zero, when identical users have maximum possible selection and rating patterns and have identical entropies, i.e., H(u j ) = H(u k ) = I(u j , u k ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Hence, given a user set with m users, an m ℅ m mutual-information-based distance matrix can be calculated by using Equation (3).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Object Community</head><p>In our approach, each item with particular feedback rating, except for 0, are regarded as objects. An object o 而x itemi is connected to both u j and u k between these two vertices set and models the characteristics of pairwise interactions rather than individual users. In this section, we perform a link-based community detection approach to differentiate the strength of connections between users and objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The object community implies the preference and criterion of particular user group for certain items.  is expected to be as large as possible so that item j is more likely to be rated as 而 k by users in the user community of the current node of the user criteria tree T.N ode.U than users from outside.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">? e (u 1 ,o 而 1 item 1 ) ﹞ ﹞ ﹞ e (u 1 ,o 而 l ? itemn ) E (u i ,o 而 k item j ) = ? ? ? . . . . . . . . .<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">e (um,o ? ? ? 而 1 item 1 ) ﹞ ﹞ ﹞ e (um,o 而 l itemn ) w o 而 k item j = 1 deg(o 而 k item j )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>The hierarchical object community generation algorithm is presented in Algorithm 2. In the algorithm, Line 1 to Line 11 are to initialise the top object community based on the user criteria clustering tree. Line 12 to Line 31 are to generate the object community OC for each node of the user criteria cluster tree T . The output of the algorithm is the object community OC set and each OC is assigned to the related node of the user criteria clustering tree T . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Facet Object Set</head><p>An important feature for hierarchical object community is that the lower level object community is, the more significant correlativeness exists among objects. However, too low levels of object community cannot include all relevant objects, and too high levels of object community may consist of too much noisy objects. Therefore, we narrow the scope of the object community to generate the corresponding facet object set which imply the preference of a certain user community. Let F O = {o i |o i ﹋ O} denote the facet object. The objects in a particular facet object not only have correlation among each others, yet are also evaluated under the same criteria by certain group of users. In terms of each internal node T.N ode with child nodes T.N ode.lef t/T.N ode.right, users in the user community of left child node T.N ode.lef t.U should also have interactions with part of objects belonging to the object community of right child node T.N ode.right.O, and vice versa. Equation 14 defines the distance between two child nodes of current internal node. The community distance value CDist(T.N ode) is smaller if two objects in object communities of child nodes are more frequently and evenly connected with users in both two child user communities. It is necessary to specify a minimum acceptable threshold value, i.e. 汛. If CDist(T.N ode) ≡ 汛, the contraction of facet object set will be terminated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Context Specific Inter-Personalised Trust Calculation</head><p>In terms of the inquired item in particular enquirer IE, more than one facet object sets which include the item IE.item j usually exist. In this section, we define two factors: Distance and Support, which influence the confidence of candidate facet object sets to figure out trustable facet object set which obtained the most confidence, and then return a more accurate prediction result to user IE.u i . Definition 5: Distance represents the divergence between user's preference, R ui and the certain facet of the world implied by the facet object set, F O. It can be calculated by using Equation 15. <ref type="bibr">(15)</ref> , where |u i .ratedItemSet ﹎ F O j .ItemSet| denotes how many items that user u i used to rate are also covered in the item-set of facet object set F O j .ItemSet.

Dist(u i , F O j ) (in our dataset, the value of Dist(u i , F O j ) ranges from 0 to 5) and will be smaller if objects in the facet object set F O j are more appropriate for user's criteria about inquiry item k . Definition 6: Support is the ratio that each facet object set F O j supports the rating history of user u i . It can be calculated by using Equation 16. K con in a normalised constant, which can be calculated by using Equation 17, and Support(u i , F O j ) ranges from 0 to 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Ru i ,F O j (Ru i .r i,k ? 而x) 2 Dist(ui, F Oj) = Ru i .r i,k =0,o 而x k ﹋F O j |ui.ratedItemSet ﹎ F Oj.ItemSet|</formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">Support(ui, F Oj) = |ui.ratedItemSet ﹎ F Oj.ItemSet| Kcon (16) Kcon = max(Support(ui, F Oj))<label>(17)</label></formula><p>As both Distance and Support occur by degrees, it is challenging to establish a mathematic model to define the membership function. Therefore, we adopt fuzzy solution to assign degrees [2] <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. A fuzzy method is applied to determine the confidence degree for each candidate facet set, F O. Dist(u i , F O j ) and Support(u i , F O j ) are two input parameters in the fuzzy method.</p><p>For Distance, three linguistic states are defined and expressed by appropriate fuzzy sets. They are Similar, Medium and Different. The membership functions for Distance are depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 2(a)</ref>. Moveover, in terms of Support, three linguistic states are defined, which are Low, Medium, High and they are also depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 2(b)</ref>. Definition 7: Confidence is the output parameter in the fuzzy method, which represents the context specific inter-personalised trust value for particular facet object set, ranging from 0 to 1. It has five linguistic states, which are Very Low, Low, Medium, High and Very High. The more confidence the facet object set is, the more trustable the rating value of the object about the enquired item IE.item j in the facet object set is, corresponding to the preference of the enquirer IE.u i . Fuzzy membership functions of these fuzzy sets are described in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 2(c)</ref>. The rule base matrix is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. It contains nine rules that describe the interaction between inputs and output. The columns are Support ranges and rows are Distance ranges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiments and Analysis</head><p>In the experiments, we compare the proposed approach with two memory-based collaborative filtering approaches, i.e. the user-based approaches and the itembased approach, and a traditional data mining algorithms, i.e. KNN. The epinions 1 dataset were used in the experiments. epinions is a consumers opinion site, and the dataset consists of 49,290 users, 664,824 ratings, and 139,738 different rated items. Numeric rating, ranging from 1 to 5, are used in each review. In the experiment, we mainly apply two metrics, i.e., Accuracy and Mean Absolute Error (MAE ). The accuracy denotes the percentages of potential quality prediction of items which are equal to the actual feedback rating values given 1 www.epinions.com/ by enquirers. However, neither user-based collaborative filtering algorithm nor item-based collaborative filtering algorithm can predict exact rating values for required items. Hence, MAE is adopted to measure the average difference between actual (true) values and predicted rating values. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> compares the Accuracy and MAE values of the four algorithms. The community-based algorithm performed better than the other three algorithms, where the MAE is around 0.721. The accuracy of proposed algorithm reaches 0.56, which is higher than the accuracy of the KNN at 0.51.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we proposed a community-based trust estimation approach to mine context specific inter-personalised trust within preference networks. It mainly focuses on users with similar preference and groups them into various user communities. Furthermore, object communities implies interest and criterion of user communities for certain items. From the experimental results, the communitybased approach can perform better than some other approaches. However, the community-based approach manages trust information in a centralized manner. In the future, we will extend the community-based mechanism to distributed environments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Definition 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>The interaction record IR is defined as a 3-tuple, IR =&lt; u i , item j , o 而x itemj &gt;. 而 x represents the feedback rating which user u i gives to item item j .</figDesc></figure>
