			<abstract>
				<p>The theory of fuzziness, offering an important scientific approach in building intelligent machines, has been researched and developed in the past fifty years from various perspectives and applied for real world problem solving in many areas. Daoist thought, being one of the most influential schools of Chinese philosophy , has been studied for more than two thousand years and its wisdom exploited from generation to generation. Would a natural echo exist between the modern fuzzy thinking and the ancient oriental Daoist thought?</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Fuzziness in Modeling Reality</head><p>Mathematical models are built for human dealing with the real world. However, the subtle behavior of the natural world (as we perceive it) cannot be modelled by rigid axioms. Most human concepts lack a rigorous definition for its vagueness and imprecision as well as its changing meaning reflecting evolving nature and human societies, the more rigorous the model, the less similar to reality. The great achievement of the theory of fuzziness is to have succeeded to build models for entities that lack a rigorous definition.</p><p>The famous Turing Test remains a dream of artificial intelligence until today. Human intelligence has been taken as the gold standard of machine intelligence, but such gold standard also lacks a rigorous definition. We apprehend the inner and the outer world by vague feelings, which become progressively more precise. "¡­ the machinery of fuzzy logic is needed for mechanization of human reasoning. In this perspective, fuzzy logic is of direct relevance to achievement of human level machine intelligence." (Zadeh) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> To further emphasize why and how we can expect that fuzzy logic plays the role of a bridge from natural to machine intelligence, Professor Zadeh has put forward the following words:</p><p>"Science deals not with reality but with models of reality. In large measure, scientific progress is driven by a quest for better models of reality. In the real world, imprecision, uncertainty and complexity have a pervasive presence. In this setting, construction of better models of reality requires a better understanding of how to deal effectively with imprecision, uncertainty and complexity. To a significant degree, development of fuzzy logic has been, and continues to be, motivated by this need." (Zadeh) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> What can be read out from the words above are guiding ideas and thought that are significant both technically and philosophically. From technical perspective, the development of a good model of reality needs to take into account imprecision, uncertainty and complexity. From philosophical perspective, humans deal with reality not directly but through models that are only approximation of the real world, and the better we handle imprecision, uncertainty and complexity, the better the model we may be able to build.</p><p>It is the philosophized thought of fuzzy logic that inspires us to further discuss some fundamental questions about human and machine intelligence, and explore a natural echo between fuzzy logic and Daoist thought, being one of the most influential schools of Chinese philosophy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Admission of Imperfection</head><p>"A concept which has a position of centrality in fuzzy logic is that of a fuzzy set. Informally, a fuzzy set is a class with a fuzzy boundary, implying a gradual transition from membership to nonmembership. A fuzzy set is precisiated through graduation, that is, through association with a scale of grades of membership. Thus, membership in a fuzzy set is a matter of degree. Importantly, in fuzzy logic everything is or is allowed to be graduated, that is, be a matter of degree. Furthermore, in fuzzy logic everything is or is allowed to be granulated, with a granule being a clump of attribute-values drawn together by indistinguishability, equivalence, similarity, proximity or functionality. Graduation and granulation form the core of fuzzy logic." (Zadeh) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> The concept of "graded membership" applies to a class that lacks a rigorous definition. Such concept is often confused with the concept of probability, which is caused by an underlying random process or by lack of information. A situation of lack of information may be improved when more information and data become available, especially with the growth of big data and information technologies. The lack of definition, however, relates to a more fundamental limitation in human's cognitive ability.</p><p>Although imprecision is a phenomena rooted at the limitation in human's cognitive ability, the idea of fuzziness is not universally accepted even today. To this situation, Professor Zadeh says, "there are many misconceptions and misunderstandings regarding fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic. To some, I was advocating an abandonment of the deep-seated tradition of striving for rigor and precision." 1 While most scientists are used to consider that accuracy and certainty are essential principle for exploring true nature of the world, Daoist 2 thinkers believe that the ultimate source and true nature of the universe is uncertain and obscure.</p><p>As many philosophical and religious traditions, Daoism has its reflection and doctrine about the source and ground of the universe, which is not so certain and acknowledgeable. One significant piece on this theme, which is found in the Laozi <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, is not providing merely theory about the beginning of our world and myriad things in the universe, but also the foundation of all other Daoist teachings and characters. The unique speculation and reflection about the possible entity and state, from which the universe comes, is a key for understanding the general attributes and uniqueness of Daoist philosophy. There are noticeable points of Daoist thought, and one comes of the most significant points is concerning the true nature of the universe.</p><p>There was something undifferentiated and yet complete, Which existed before heaven and earth. (Chap. 25)</p><p>The word "undifferentiated" in the above quotation is a render of the Chinese word "hun" which may suggest mixture, unclear, or shapeless etc. The state of the origin and the formation of the beginning of the world, and the ground that sustains myriad things are merely ambiguous. In the Laozi, all sentences related to the ultimate reason and truth share the same style. Thus Daoist statements about the true nature of the universe are always hesitating; at least they seem to reflect nonperfect confidence. Thus, the Laozi further states:</p><p>It may be considered the mother of the universe. I do not know its name; I style it "Dao" (Tao, Way). If forced to give it a name, I shall call it Great. (ibid.)</p><p>The author of Laozi frankly admits that he does not know what is the origin or the mother of the universe. Dao is just a styled symbol or nickname of the source 1 Lotfi A. Zadeh has distributed the same message repeatedly, the quotation here is from his message distributed to BISC online discussion group on Oct 2013. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> The word Daoism suggests complicated thought system (or Daoist philosophy) and Daoist religious movements. In this essay, the Daoist theories are mainly based on the first Daoist text Daodejing (Tao-te-ching) or the Laozi (Lao-tzu). This has nothing to do with Daoist religious teachings. The quotations from the Laozi are based on Liu's complication and adaptation from various versions and translations, unless specific citations provided otherwise. and ground of the universe. It has no proper name. If being forced to give it a name, he will call it Great. Obviously, great, similar to good, bad, big, small, etc., cannot be used as a proper name. What the author repeatedly emphasizes is that no one knows exactly the foundation and true nature of the world, though the author does believe there is something functioning as the ultimate source and ground of all beings in the world.</p><p>This makes Daoism different from many religious and philosophical doctrines. The Bible describes clearly and precisely the processing of God's creation of the universe; Plato's theory sees it specifically and systematically as the relation between the transcendent kingdom of perfect ideas and the empirical world of imperfect myriad things. Even in other Chinese or oriental religious and philosophical schools, we find such differences from Daoism. Buddhism confidently disserts that the truth of world is essentially empty, all existence we can see and feel are just delusion and untrue; Confucian thinkers strongly believe that the moral doctrine tian-li (heavenly principle) is the ultimate truth of the world.</p><p>Further examining, we find some key concepts in which both the theory of fuzziness and the thought of Daoism surprisingly coincide. Here we list a few.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. True and False</head><p>In fuzzy logic everything is, or is allowed to be graduated, that is, be a matter of degree. Fuzzy logic allows no clear distinguishing between true and false, and introduces a numerical grade or word to indicate the degree of truth of a piece of knowledge or information. In fuzzy inference systems, a perfect truth is not required for data, information and knowledge, and the executions of inference are done on an approximate basis. This greatly extends the ability of precise reasoning in handling real world problems with imprecision, incompleteness, or partial truth. In such, fuzzy logic establishes fuzzy reasoning containing precise reasoning as its special case.</p><p>From the Daoist viewpoint, there is nothing absolutely right and true, yet true and false dose not distinct clearly. The Laozi claims in Chap. 41: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Good and Bad</head><p>The idea that "membership in a fuzzy set is a matter of degree" made a fundamental revolution to classical set theory, that is membership and non-membership are not in an absolute distinguishing. This is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> The concepts of a set and a fuzzy set are derived from the concept of a class through precisiation. A fuzzy set has a fuzzy boundary. A fuzzy set is precisiated through graduation ( In our everyday life, good and bad are often treated as two opposite concepts. However, when the two are applied to make evaluation with the same criteria, they both appear to be fuzzy sets with unsharpened boundary and possible overlap in between. The same spirit applies to many pairs of concepts that are usually considered opposite, such as long and short, big and small, high and low, fast and slow, etc. The distinguishing factors between these paired concepts are only relative. Some well accepted and widely adopted schemes in our life, such as "passing" or "failure" of school examination, are a binary precisiation of "good-bad" defined as crisp sets on numerical scores. The theory of fuzzy set provides a mathematical tool to handle concepts that are not fully distinguishable and differentiable.</p><p>The sentences previously quoted from Laozi Chap. 41 reveal Daoist position that everything appears as containing the opposite elements, which are in contradiction and mutual transformation. In addition, the uncertainty comes from the transformation of the oppositional elements in all beings or things. For example, the Laozi argues in Chap. 58: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High and low distinguish each other; Front and back follow each other. Therefore the sage manages affairs without action. And spreads doctrines without words. ([4]: 140)</head><p>According to the Laozi, all seemingly quite different oppositions are actually in transition and mutually effected. All these oppositional transformations suggest the difficulty of our knowledge and recognition in reality. It should be noticed that when mentioning "manages affairs without action" and "spreads doctrines without words" the Laozi does not mean to do nothing, but special action different from regular actions by common rulers and people. We shall relate to this point in Sect. 4 with fuzzy decision.</p><p>The important finding here is that both Fuzzy Logic and Daoist thought are aware of the fundamental limitation in human's cognitive ability in handling the complexity of real world. While Daoism establishes the philosophical foundation for the discussion of this limitation, fuzzy logic provides a practical mathematical tool to describe concepts that are not fully distinguishable and differentiable. In other words, Daoism explores the limitations and the reasons that they exist, and fuzzy logic discusses how we can act under such limitations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Precisiation and Description</head><p>In order to have a machinery to deal with imprecision in reality, we need precisiation for our understanding and description of reality. Informally, precisiation is an operation which transforms an object, p, into another object, p*, which is more precisely defined, in some specified sense, than p. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>.  The significance of the theory of precisiation may be understood from two aspects: a technical aspect, and a philosophical aspect. From the technical aspect, with the utilization of fuzzy sets, fuzzy truths, fuzzy numbers, type-2 or higher order fuzziness, it allows but not ignores or rejects undifferentiation; it provides a spectrum between true and false, know and don't-know, to more naturally reflect the human knowledge imperfection; it offers tools for describing highly complex situation with mixed types of imperfection involved.</p><p>From the philosophical aspect, it accepts the limitations in human cognitive ability, therefore sets up a rational foundation for discussion of machine intelligence having human intelligence as the gold standard. There are many things in the universe that we don't know, and more importantly there are also many things we don't know how much we know, or don't know how to describe or evaluate what we know. Precisiation is a process through which we describe, and evaluate the world we perceive with our limited capability and resources. The result of precisiation is a simplified model of reality but not the true reality, referring to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>, we have p* ¡Ù p.</p><p>The philosophical thinking behind the fuzziness and precisiation finds an echo from the Daoist admission of the limitation of human's cognition.</p><p>The general feature of Dao combines both being and nonbeing, though not in a strait forward way. All descriptions of Dao seem to suggest non-being (wu), in the sense that human beings cannot grasp it because it is not any concrete thing humans can perfectly capture. The Laozi, in Chap. 14, describes it this way: "It cannot be given any name" or it cannot be nameable implies the impossibility for human beings to cognize Dao, because it is transcendent and out of our approach. Similar ideas are presented in the Laozi Chap. 25, which reveals the Daoist conception of the source and ground of the universe. Here it reads:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">We</formula><p>There was something undifferentiated and yet complete, Which existed before heaven and earth. Soundless and formless, it depends on nothing, and does not change. It may be considered the mother of the universe. I do not know its name; I style it "Dao" (Tao, Way). If forced to give it a name, I shall call it Great. Now being great means functioning everywhere. Functioning everywhere means far-reaching. Being far-reaching means returning to the original state. This is a reflection of Daoist attitude towards human being's capacity of cognition and understanding. Daoism has little dogmatic assertion; instead, Daoism intends to faithfully represent the difficulty and limitation of human beings observation and understanding.</p><p>The words "soundless and formless" in the above-quoted passage is also a kind of description of Dao in coping with the ambiguity. Without a definition a "description" leaves a room of tolerance for imprecision and vagueness. The limitation of human beings' intelligence and cognition is an important concern of Daoism. We can further examine knowing and unknowing in dealing the reality to better understand Dao. In Chap. 1, the Laozi argues:</p><p>The way can be spoken of, but it will not be the constant way; The name can be named, but is will not be the constant name. The nameless is the beginning of myriad things, The named is the mother of myriad things. ( <ref type="bibr">[5]: 267)</ref> Here the nameless and the named are two characteristic aspects of Dao, which refer to the human faculty of recognition of Dao and also its limitation.</p><p>Furthermore from the admission of the fundamental limitation in human's cognitive ability, another important finding here is that both Fuzzy Logic and Daoist thought are aware of the gap existing between any description (model) and the reality being described. While Daoism has this idea supported by its ancient wisdom, fuzzy logic names precisiation as one of the unique characteristics in human thinking towards modern machine intelligence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Decision with Imperfection and Action with Nonaction</head><p>Fuzzy decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, or decision in fuzzy environment, is the confluence of fuzzy goals and constraints that reflect naturally real world situations. One of the key features found in fuzzy decision is that the decision maker is not forced to give a precise formulation, merely for the sake of mathematical reasons. A fuzzy decision is made with a compromise of the satisfaction of multiple constraints and objectives that are described with fuzziness. The importance or proportion of contribution of each constraint or objective may be arranged in appropriate ways.</p><p>There are two key ideas here that attract our attention. The first is that one is not forced to provide a precise formulation, if the original problem comes from a fuzzy environment; the second is that a decision is made as the confluence of fuzzy goals and constraints for a compromise.</p><p>Let's examine Daoist perspectives in decision and action. Viewing the inevitable transformation of everything in the world, the Laozi argues for a distinctive way of actions, of which the complicated meaning cannot be translated, therefore we take a compromised way using nonaction as a token for the Chinese term wu-wei. Literally, it sounds like no action at all, but actually, it implies a special way of action, a negation of regular ways, for transcendent and better results. That is summed as a famous saying: "To do nothing yet leave nothing undone." This way is different or opposite from common ways to deal with governance, as well as general affairs.</p><p>The spirit of nonaction is to do business for better or distinctive outcomes and minimum side or bad effects.</p><p>Aiming at a confluence of fuzzy goals and constraints allows one to make an optimal decision with multiple criteria and objectives taken into account. Without requiring forced precision in modeling fuzzy decision making, one will be able to keep more information (with imprecision and vagueness) from reality and bring that to final decision; and will also be able to minimize the extra inaccuracy introduced through forced precision in early stages. In other words, no forced action for precision leads to more accuracy to reality. At this point, we find another consistency between the spirits of fuzzy logic and Daoism in their deep roots.</p><p>For the Daoist aspects, a typical manner of nonaction is assisting (fu in the original Laozi literature, which can be translated as to assist, help, or support, etc.) From the Laozi Chap. 64, we read: As for the meaning of fu or assisting, it is better understood as a spectrum between two extremes. One extreme is restraint, manipulation, interruption, interference, exploitation, control, and oppression; the other is pampering, spoiling, indulgence, permissiveness, and over-protection. Thus, fu or assistance is the careful and prudent art of sagely leadership; its purpose and objective are completely aimed at benefiting the myriad things, no aspect of which shows off the sage's own importance and intelligence or accrues personal benefits. This fu or assistance is a typical example of nonaction for better results from unusual actions.</p><p>The key point lies in the last sentence: the sage assists the myriad creatures to realize their natural prosperousness, but dares not to act generally in the manner of the common people. In this way, the sage seems to do nothing yet reaches the best result: all things get the right chance to develop themselves in a harmony condition.</p><p>In the past fifty years Lotfi A. Zadeh, the founding father of fuzzy logic, has selflessly provided his support, and assistance to thousands of scientists and researchers by guiding new directions, encouraging discussions, and listening to comments and even disagreements. Without his guidance and continuous efforts in establishing a friendly, an encouraging, and a harmony environment in the fuzzy logic community, the achievement of fuzzy logic research would never be the same. The success of fuzzy logic witnesses how the spirit of fu helps our development in science and technology.</p><p>The study of fuzzy decision has made an important foundation of utilizing human intelligence for decision making in a fuzzy environment. "Humans have many remarkable capabilities. Among them there are two that stand out in importance. First, the capability to converse, communicate, reason and make rational decisions in an environment of imprecision, uncertainty, incompleteness of information, partiality of truth and partiality of possibility. ¡­" (Zadeh) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In spite of the limited cognitive ability in describing the real world with imprecision, uncertainty, and partial truth, humans are able to approximate the reality for their problem solving with amazingly simplified models, through observation and intuition, as well as rational analyses. One important evidence is that a fuzzy rule-based system in general uses a far less number of rules compared to a typical rule-based expert system for the same application, through appropriate fuzzy granulation. Computing with words <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> opens the door for further exploring potential utilization of human wisdom toward the development of human level machine intelligence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Between Fuzzy Logic and Daoist Thought</head><p>Fuzzy logic as a principal member of soft computing has been considered to be positioned in a "soft" branch of science among the others. On the other hand, Chinese philosophy has been considered less strict compared to Western philosophy, and Daoist thought is one of the most influential schools of Chinese philosophy. Inspired by the philosophized thought of fuzzy logic, we have made an attempt to explore an echo between fuzzy logic and Daoist thought, and compare similarities of some key concepts from both theories. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 1</ref> briefly summarizes our key findings. Daoism emphasizes the infinite and transience of myriad things in the world. Fuzzy Logic aims at practical approach for human intellectual activities through precisiation. 3</p><p>Acting: Human beings should and can try to approximate the truth through irregular way of knowing. This approximation is more accurate than certain precise descriptions or claims because many boundaries in the real world are not clear.</p><p>Daoist thought develops its theory through rational observation and analyses, as well as intuition to approximate the true nature of the world. Fuzzy Logic has graduation and granulation as keys to approach the infinite and complex reality.</p><p>In summary, our motivation and the significance of such comparison are supported by several points.</p><p>(1) Finding the mutual support between scientific approaches and philosophical wisdom, between the modern and antique, and between the West and East cultures. (2) Having found more broad and solid theories to correct dogmatic and romantic belief about infinite human knowledge and capability. (3) Further exploring human wisdom in rational action with knowledge imperfection toward future human level machine intelligence. (4) The research in Daoism and fuzzy logic can be inspired from each other to further develop their theories and argumentations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We have argued that important concepts in fuzzy logic and Daoist thought echo each other from afar. The values of Daoism to modern society have recently been significantly recognized in critical issues, such as environment protection, social harmony, and management science <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Would the application of fuzzy thinking make it more executable in modern society for some of the key ideas of Daoist thought? Would it be possible to further exploit human wisdom in ancient thoughts through the channel of fuzzy thinking, to support future development of machine intelligence? We do not yet have concrete answers and our findings are still very preliminary, but we believe such discussion will be beneficial for building a more bright future of the world, either from system engineering or human society point of view.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 The concepts of a set and a fuzzy set are derived from the concept of a class through precisiation.
