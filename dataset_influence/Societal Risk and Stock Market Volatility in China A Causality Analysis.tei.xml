<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The transformation of development of economy and society in China is at a crucial stage. The contradictions and conflicts among different social strata, such as the rich and the poor, become increasingly salient and exert adverse effects on social stability, leading to a lot of societal risks. It is known that a stable and harmonious society is the basic guarantee for economy development. That is to say, external social circumstances such as nation's security and foreign relations, government policy, anti-corruption, etc. may have impacts on economic and financial markets. Meanwhile, higher risk may arise in the process of economy development, which poses a threat to social stability. Therefore, in order to guarantee social stability and the healthy growth of national economy, the possible risks existing in economy and finance and the causes of those risks are worth being analyzed. The stock market could be regarded as the barometer of economic development, to a certain extent, reflecting conditions of the national economy. It is of great significance to study the relationship between societal risk and stock market volatility.</p><p>In the Web 2.0 era, traditional media has been surpassed by the Internet which is more open and interactive. Internet users are not only content viewers but also content producers. Among many Internet services, search engines have been the most common tools to access information, not only meeting search requirements but also recording foci of netizens. There have been some research achievements exploiting the search data for predicting economic activities, providing a new perspective to understand the conditions of economy. The CPI was well predicted through utilizing Google search query data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, as well as retail sales <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In the field of finance, search query data were successfully used for predicting dynamics of stock market volatility <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and measuring the retail investors' attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. The research on the correlation between the search volume and investors' attention indicated that the increase of search activity was associated with increase of trading activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Furthermore, there were studies found that an increase in search volume tended to precede stock market falls <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. The search query data are closely related to stock market at information times. In this paper, we try to investigate the relationship between online societal risk acquired by Internet searching behavior and stock market volatility.</p><p>Societal risk perception is the subjective evaluation of public concerns to risk events. Traditional research on societal risk perception is studied from social psychology. The psychometric paradigm of risk perception is designed to ask the public to fill out questionnaires about acceptable risks, then assess public's attitude toward critical societal risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. However, the result of this methodology is restricted by the selection of the samples, as well as the authenticity of the answers. Large-scale surveys of societal risk perception are generally expensive and time-consuming to be conducted. The researchers constructed a new framework of societal risk indicators based on word association tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Online public concerned data are mapped into respective societal risks based on societal risk indicators. Instead of asking respondents to answer questions about societal risk, the query data provided by the public actively reflect what are real concerned, and thus provide researchers a novel access to analyze societal issues.</p><p>In this paper, we concern about the question whether the variations of the societal risk have significant effects on stock market volatility. To answer the question, quantitative societal risk levels are presented and the Shanghai Composite Index is chosen to study stock market volatility. Different from previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the risk level data of holidays and weekends are also taken into consideration to discuss whether there are any impacts on stock price change or not. Three different econometric methods are developed to explore relationships between societal risk levels and Shanghai Composite Index. This paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 illustrates the measurement of societal risk and introduction of Shanghai Composite Index. Section 3 introduces three methods on the relationships between societal risk levels and Shanghai Composite Index. Section 4 presents results analysis. Conclusions and future work are given in Sect. 5.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Measurement of Societal Risk</head><p>Due to the limitations of the traditional psychological methods, online societal risk perception is proposed to acquire public's concerns toward critical societal risk. Baidu is now the biggest Chinese search engine. Baidu hot news search words (HNSW) are based on real-time search behaviors of hundreds of millions of Internet users and released at Baidu News Portal 1 , reflecting the current concerns and ongoing social topics. Therefore, HNSW can serve as the corpus to get netizens' attention to the highlighted events and provide a perspective to analyze societal risk.</p><p>HNSW and their relevant hot news with URLs at the first page of hot words search results are crawled every hour <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. Researchers from CAS Institute of Psychology constructed a framework of societal risk indicators including 7 categories which are national security, economy/finance, public morals, daily life, social stability, government management, and resources/environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Tang has tried to map HNSW into either risk-free event or one event with risk label from these 7 risk categories, then aggregate all risky events over the whole concerns as the on-line societal risk perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. The daily total risk level is obtained by computing the risky proportion of all hot search words in a day. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows daily total risk levels based on HNSW from January of 2012 to December of 2016 with a total number of 1827 data. The generated <ref type="bibr">5-year (2012-2016)</ref> daily societal risk data provide an overview of China's societal risk situation.</p><p>Among the 5-year data, the average risk level of 2012 is 0.554, while that of 2013 is 0.586. However, the average risk levels of 2014, 2015 and 2016 are 0.421, 0.330 and 0.27 respectively, with the annual average risk level decreasing year by year. It may show the achievements of our country in building harmonious socialist society in a way. Moreover, the societal risk levels have dropped off during the Spring Festival, as well as the Olympic Games. As the concept "Harmonious society" was proposed in 2004, there were many studies on the measurement of a harmonious society. Such the Beijing's Harmonious Society Index and Green GDP were put forward to measure the harmonious degree of a society <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. Besides, a study named "Happiness Survey" was carried out by China Central Television (CCTV) by asking people if they were happy and what happiness meant. However, these indexes are difficult to be measured and come from different government offices. The daily societal risk levels can serve as an additional way to measure the harmonious degree of a society, which truly and more efficiently reflect the social situations. In other words, the societal risk perception indicators, daily societal risk levels, could be the thermometer of Chinese society to some extent.</p><p>Furthermore, the risk level of one category is calculated as one ratio of frequency of words labeled that category over total frequency of hot words. Temporal risk levels of each risk category are acquired, which indicates specific societal risks change over time in details. Researchers had demonstrated that risk levels of each category were predictive of public moods including Happiness, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust when investigating the correlation between societal risk and social moods <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. In this paper, we study the relation of individual risk level of each category with Shanghai Composite Index.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Shanghai Composite Index</head><p>Shanghai Composite Index is the broadest and most influential comprehensive index across Chinese Security Markets, which can accurately reflect the overall situation of China's stock market. The Shanghai Composite Index is more commonly utilized in many domestic studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16]</ref>. In this paper, we download the data from Wind financial terminal, including a total number of 1214 transactions from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2016. Different from the daily risk level, there are no trading data on holidays and weekends, and thus leads to different sizes of those two sets of data.</p><p>The economic and financial issues as one of societal risk categories may cause the oscillations on the risk levels. We wonder if the changes on risk levels of 7 categories could affect financial and economic fluctuations. Therefore, we try to explore the relationship among the levels of 7 categories of societal risks and the Shanghai Composite Index.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Correlation Between Societal Risk Levels and Shanghai Composite Index</head><p>Baidu hot news search words, online public concerned data, have been mapped into either risk-free events or one event with a label from 7 categories. The risk level of one category is calculated as one ratio of frequency of words labeled that category over the total frequency of hot search words. In this section, we investigate whether the variations of the societal risk have a significant effect on the ups and downs of the stock price. We choose the daily closing price increment to indicate the fluctuation of stock market. Since there are no trading data on holidays and weekends, the data of no-trading days are dropped when analyzing the relation between them. However, risky events happened on notrading days may have an impact on the future values of Shanghai Composite Index when the next work day is coming. As a result, three approaches with different data processing are developed to analyze the correlation between levels of 7 categories of societal risks and the closing price increment from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2016.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Method Based on Granger Causality Test</head><p>Due to the lack of trading data on the holidays and weekends, we remove the risk level data of dates that have no transaction data, and we carry out the econometric method of Granger causality test on these two sets of data. Then we utilize vector autoregressive model (VAR) to carry out Granger causality test. The daily societal risk level is chosen as independent variable, while the closing price increment is chosen as the dependent variable to detect if societal risk perception can affect the volatility of stock price. As far as the lag orders, we just consider it delaying for 5 days. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows the results of Granger causality correlation of the closing price increment and societal risk levels of 7 categories.  According to the results of Granger causality in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, we observe that economy/finance has the Granger causality relation with closing price increment lagging from 4 and 5 days while social stability lagging 1 day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Method Based on Decaying Exponential Function</head><p>Different from the first approach, in order to capture the risk information of no-trading days, we define a decaying exponential function. Through setting different weight coefficients, the risk information of holidays or weekends is added to the risk level of the day just before holidays or weekends. Therefore, the risk level of the day before holidays or weekends r m is recomputed based on original risk level and given by Eq. 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">n r m = r m+i c n+1?i . (1) i=0</formula><p>Here, n is the length of successive days with no trading data. For normal weekends, n = 2. c is a dampening constant that gives a higher weight to the risk level of recent days. In this paper, we choose c = 2. The exponential function is chosen so that distant risk level affects r m without outweighing more recent risk levels. Based on the defined decaying exponential function above, we obtain a new sequence of risk levels based on the original data. Then ADF test is conducted. We test the unit root of closing price increment and the new sequence of risk levels. The test results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> show that all of them have no unit root. Again, we employ Granger causality analysis. The results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. As we can see from <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, economy/finance has the Granger causality relation with closing price increment for lagging 2, 4 and 5 days, while social stability has the Granger causality relation for lagging 4 and 5 days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Method Based on Multiple Linear Regression 3</head><p>To avoid changing the original societal risk data, we apply the multiple linear regressions to analyze the relationship between the temporal data of societal risk and closing price increment, which is chosen as the dependent variable. Different days of the societal risk level of one category are chosen as independent variables. There will generate a corresponding number of sequences to the lag number of days for any risk category. As a result, we construct 7 regression models for each <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. Granger causality correlation of the closing price increment and 7 societal risks <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Variable  Lag  1 day 2 days 3 days 4 days  5</ref>   Here, y t represents the closing price increment of the tth day, while y t?j indicates that of lagging j trading days. x t?j is societal risk level of one category which lags j days. ¦Á j and ¦Â j are the regression coefficients. u t is the error term which reflects the parts of changes in y that cannot be explained by x. To match the lag orders with the two approaches above, we set k = 5. The results of statistic values for either the significance of coefficients or significance of multiple linear regression models are respectively listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Tables 5 and 6</ref>.  As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>, all the regression models are significant based on F statistics. The sequences of economy/finance lagging 2 days have significant effects on closing price increment, so as those of social stability lagging 2 days, and those of government management lagging 5 days. The result is different from those of previous two approaches. </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">k k y t = ¦Ã + ¦Á j y t?j + ¦Â j x t?j + u t .<label>(2)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results Analysis</head><p>Based on the above results, three different approaches demonstrate distinguishing findings on the correlation between societal risk and stock volatility. As to the first approach, the original data sequence of societal risk level is used to carry out the research, while the risk data on no-trading days are ignored without regarding their effects on stock volatility. The experimental results show that economy/finance and social stability have significant effects on closing price increment. In terms of the second approach, the decaying exponential function is adopted to capture the risk information of no-trading days by processing the original data. The results are different from the first with different delay days on the risk of economy/finance and social stability. The subcategories of economy/finance include financial problems and economic problems. As is known, the macroeconomic policy adjustment, the economic slowdown, the monetary policy, RMB exchange rate etc. will cause the fluctuation of stock prices. Besides, stable social situations is a vital prerequisite for development of finance and economy. Events that threaten social stability such as public security, crime, and major infectious diseases etc. which are the subcategories of social stability have a certain impact on stock market. Compared to the two previous modeling approaches, not only do we consider the effects of risk information on no-trading days in the third approach, but also avoid processing the raw data. We construct regression models by generating a corresponding number of sequences to the lag number of days for any risk category. Moreover, the result has a novel finding that the risk government management has an impact on closing price increment, which shows that the raw data carry more information. The risk levels of holidays and weekends influence the closing price increment through different processing of risk information on no-trading days. In other words, the search queries data on holidays and weekends may have some effects on stock market. The subcategories of government management such as government policy and anti-corruption etc. also influence the volatility of the stock market. For instance, the economy and stock market of Lvliang city had crashed since the anti-corruption movement in Shanxi. However, the data processing of the third approach is a more complex work due to the construction of a total of 35 risk level sequences for each category.</p><p>The experimental results of the three methods show that social risk perception has a certain prediction effect on the Shanghai Composite Index. Given all that, the collective risk perception, reflect the public opinions' impacts on the stock market volatility, as well as social and economic conditions to some extent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>Societal risk perception is the subjective evaluation of public concerns to risk events. It reflects the public attitudes to social issues as well as government decision-making, which are the key indicators for effective social management and policy making. With the rapid growth of Internet data, an increasing number of researchers make use of user-generated contents to study social issues.</p><p>In this paper, we map on-line community concerns into respective societal risk events based on Baidu search engine by using the public searching behavior. Then we conduct the research on exploring the relationship between societal risk perception and stock market volatility. The main contributions and innovations are summarized as follows.</p><p>(1) Societal risk perception is quantitatively described. We present a reliable, scalable and timely assessment of the societal risk instead of large-scale survey which is expensive and time consuming to be conducted. (2) The study on correlation between societal risk and stock price change is first carried out. Public searching queries are mapped into specific societal risk events. Then we analyze what kinds of risk events with risk labels from 7 risk categories have impacts on stock volatility. The results show that the risk of finance/economy, social stability and government management may cause the fluctuation of stock market. (3) Different from previous research, the risk information of holiday is also taken into consideration to discuss the impact on stock price change based on three different methods. The results indicate that risk information of no-trading days can affect the stock volatility.</p><p>Lots of improvements are needed. The intrinsic mechanism of the relationship between societal risk and stock price fluctuation requires further research. Meanwhile, quantitative societal risk data which are more time-sensitive will be essentially used to study more social issues.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
