			<abstract>
				<p>Modern China is undergoing a variety of social conflicts as the arrival of new era with the transformation of the principal contradiction. Then monitoring the society operating at a stable state is a huge workload. Online societal risk perception is acquired by mapping on-line public concerns respectively into societal risk events including national security, economy &amp; finance, public morals, daily life, social stability, govern ment management, and resources &amp; environ ment, and then provides one kind of measurement toward the society state. Obviously, stable and harmonious social situations are the basic guarantee fo r the healthy development of the stock market. Thus we concern whether the variations of the societal risk are related to stock market volatility. We study their relationships by two steps, first the relationships between search trends and societal risk perception; next the relationships between societal risk perception and stock volatility. The weekend and holiday effects in China stock market are taken into consideration. Three different econometric methods are exp lored to observe the impacts of variations of societal risk on Shanghai Composite Index and Shenzhen Co mposite Index. 3 major findings are addressed. Firstly, there exist causal relat ions between Baidu Index and societal risk perception. Secondly, the perception of finance &amp; economy, social stability, and govern ment management has distinguishing effects on the volatility of both Shanghai Composite Index and Shenzhen Co mposite Index. Th irdly, the weekend and holiday effects of societal risk perception on the stock market are verified. The research demonstrates that capturing societal risk based on on-line public concerns is feasible and meaningful.</p>

Large-scale surveys on acquisition of societal risks and conflicts with the societal risk perception are expensive and transformation of the principal contradictions. time-consuming. Researchers fro m Institute of The unbalanced and inadequate development in Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences economic, social, and ecological fields threatens developed a framework o f societal risk includ ing the social stability (Bai 2017). Stable and 7 major categories and 30 minor categories by harmonious social situations are the basic surveys in Beijing area in 2007 (Zheng et al. guarantee for economy growth. That is to say, 2009). The 7 major risk categories are national social circu mstances such as nation's s ecurity and security, economy &amp; finance, public mo rals, foreign relations, technology development, daily life, social stability, govern ment material needs, etc. may have impacts on management, and resources &amp; environment; each economy and finance markets. And the risks category of major risk includes several kinds of arising fro m economy and finance develop ment risk events as minor categories. Instead of could influence social stability as well. The stock conducting time-consuming surveys, Tang (2013) market is often regarded as the barometer of tried to map on-line public concerns (either hot economic situations to some extent (Chen et al. search words or BBS, b logs, tweets, etc.) into 2014). Societal risk perception is conducted to either risk-free event or one event with risk label measure the harmonious society construction fro m those 7 risk categories, then aggregated all (Zheng et al. 2009). Thus it is worth investigating risk events over the whole concerns as the on-line relationships between societal risk perception societal risk perception, so as to quickly while and stock market volatility. roughly help to understand the happening or Societal risk refers to the risk events potential hazards based on user generated involving major hazards (Ball &amp; contents.
