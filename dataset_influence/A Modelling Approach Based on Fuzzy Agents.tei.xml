			<abstract>
				<p>Modelling of complex systems is mainly based on the decomposition of these systems in autonomous elements, and the identification and definitio9n of possible interactions between these elements. For this, the agent-based approach is a modelling solution often proposed. Complexity can also be due to external events or internal to systems, whose main characteristics are uncertainty, imprecision, or whose perception is subjective (i.e. interpreted). Insofar as fuzzy logic provides a solution for modelling uncertainty, the concept of fuzzy agent can model both the complexity and uncertainty. This paper focuses on introducing the concept of fuzzy agent: a classical architecture of agent is redefined according to a fuzzy perspective. A pedagogical illustration of fuzzy agentification of a smart watering system is then proposed. Software agents are autonomous and distributed entities that are able to develop tasks either by themselves or by collaborating with other agents. An agent is a computer entity, located in an environment that it perceives, in which it acts [2]. This environment can be composed of other agents with whom it interacts independently. Fuzzy logic offers a framework for representing uncertainty and subjectivity of the real world. It has similarities with the way actors act as it uses a model of approximate reasoning that allows it to deal with design uncertainties. Agents, that implement uncertain problems by means of fuzzy logic, are called fuzzy agents [3, 4, 5]. So, how to apply the properties of agents to fuzzy agents?</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Complex systems are often characterized by the distribution of their components, as well as the distribution of knowledge to the general activity of these components <ref type="bibr">(calculations, problem solving, etc.)</ref>. When a problem cannot be solved by the concomitant action of several components of a complex system, sensitive to its environment, this leads to a series of interactions, often non-deterministic, between its components. Then the agent paradigm offers an interesting solution for modelling and developing complex systems. In addition, in real situations of decision support or cooperation, knowledge used by the components of complex systems is often inaccurate, incomplete, subject to uncertain assessments. Then, agents can be effectively used to handle complex uncertain problems where global knowledge is distributed and shared by a number of agents of a complex system, aiming to achieve a consensual solution in a collaborative way. Using intelligent agents that implement collaborative and distributed activity of complex system, with fuzzy logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, is recommended due to the uncertain nature of the collaboration, distribution, interaction in cooperative problems solving. So, how to model these agents?</p><p>In various fields of engineering (manufacturing, mobile robots, ambient intelligence, etc.), fuzzy agents was proposed as tool to model fuzzy behaviour problems, where agents can decide to act according to a fuzzy-logic rule base <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. These agents can then use these rules to build a strategy for making decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Fuzzy agents are also used in fuzzy reasoning situations, where agents interpret a situation, solve a problem or decide with fuzzy knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Simulation of social relationships is also an area for experimentation fuzzy agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Implementations of fuzzy agents are also proposed to solve distributed fuzzy problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, or improving the processing of the fuzziness of information, knowledge and interactions, in problem solving processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Despite the emergence of all this research, agents are not formalized enough to support the holistic view of tasks and processes performed by complex system. Given the need to design agents adapted to model, simulate and solve distributed problems with level of uncertainty, we proposed to better define the concept of fuzzy agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. This paper explains and develops the model of fuzzy agents, their interactions and their organizations.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in the second section, with the perspective of fuzzy agent modelling, the main characteristics of fuzzy logic and fuzzy reasoning are presented. In the third section, modelling of fuzzy agent is proposed. In the fourth section implementation and application of fuzzy agents for a smart watering system is presented. In the last section, the conclusion shows some perspectives and interest in the proposed approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Fuzzy concept: set, logic and reasoning</head><p>Fuzzy logic was introduced by Zadeh <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> as a framework for approximate reasoning. The fuzzy deductive reasoning can be considered an extension of the reasoning in classical logic. The basic operators of classical logic are also defined for the fuzzy logic:</p><p>? The conjunction of two fuzzy proposals "V is A" and A classic set has elements that satisfy all of its specific properties. More formally, a subset A of a reference set X can be described from its characteristic function</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 , 0 : ¡ú X A ¦Ö</formula><p>as follows <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(1)</ref>:</p><p>"W is B" is a fuzzy proposal whose truth value ? A¡ÄB is obtained by aggregation using a t-norm of truth values of the two proposals (usually, ? A¡ÄB (x) = min(? A (x), ? B (x)).</p><p>? The disjunction of two fuzzy proposals "V is A" and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">¡ÊA x si ? ? ? = A x 1 sinon 0 ) ( ¦Ö<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Thus, elements that do not satisfy all the properties of X cannot belong to this set.</p><p>"W is B" is a fuzzy proposal whose truth value ? A¡ÅB is obtained by aggregation using a t-conorm truth values of the two proposals (usually, ? A¡ÅB (x) = max(? A (x), ? B (x)).</p><p>? The negation of a fuzzy proposal "V is A" is a fuzzy proposal whose truth value is ?? A (usually, ?? A (x) = However many subsets cannot be defined by a specific property: the subset "Warm Temperatures" of set "Temperatures", for example. It is then necessary to introduce a generalization of the characteristic function of membership of a subset of A denoted ? A which associates to each element x of X a real value ? A (x) in the interval <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref>. This membership function allows highlighting grades membership of elements of the set X and the reference to define a fuzzy subset of X. The operations defined on regular subsets (equality, inclusion, union, intersection, complement, etc.) are also used for fuzzy subsets. Thus, for a fuzzy relation R between two universes of reference X and Y is defined membership function (2):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">1 -? A (x)).</formula><p>? The fuzzy implication is used to represent knowledge</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">[ ] 1 , 0 : ¡ú ¡ÁY X f R (2)</formula><p>Fuzzy logic, in its strict logical knowledge representation using fuzzy sets, is based on fuzzy elementary propositions as "V is A" defined from a set L of linguistic variables (V, X, T V ) where V is a variable, X is the universe in which it takes its values, and T V is a list of characterizations of V represented by fuzzy subsets of X <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. about a system in the form of rules such as "IF V is A THEN W is B", built from linguistic variables (V, X, T V ) and (W, Y, T W ). Such a rule defines on X¡ÁY a relation R, that is noted A¡úB, between the values taken by V and those taken by W. The relationship A¡úB determines the bonding strength between the premise "V is A" and the conclusion "W is B". Its membership function ? A¡úB corresponds to the truth value of the fuzzy implication between the two proposals. There are many forms of fuzzy implication which generally come from work on multivalued logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Thus, one proposed by <ref type="bibr">G?del-Brouwer (3)</ref> or that of Mamdani (4) where implication is seen as a conjunctive relation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">? ? ? = ¡Ü ¡ú y six on y B A y x 1 sin ) , ( ? (3) )) ( ), ( min( ) , ( y x y x B A B A ? ? ? = ¡ú (4)</formula><p>For instance, let us consider the temperature V, and the list T V = {A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , A 4 , A 5 }, where A 1 = cold, A 2 = mild, A 3 = normal, A 4 = hot, and A 5 = burning <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 5)</ref>.</p><p>A fuzzy elementary proposition is constructed from a fuzzy subset A of T V or a modified form of this fuzzy subset (weakening or strengthening). Its truth value belongs to any set <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref>, and it is provided by the membership function of the fuzzy set ? A . The proposition is especially true for any value x of X that ? A (x) is high, so that x is strongly characteristic A of V. A truth value equal to 1 (respectively 0) corresponds to a proposition absolutely true (respectively absolutely false).</p><p>Extending the modus ponens, which allows to deduce that q is true from the knowledge of a rule "IF p THEN q" and the truth of p, Zadeh introduced the principle of compositional rule of inference, which is deduced easily from the principle of combination-projection. This rule allows to deduce information on the variable W from the knowledge of a rule "IF V is A THEN W is B" and a proposition "V is A'" which should imperfectly to premise "V is A" of the rule. The description B' of W which is obtained is defined by the membership function (5):</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">)) , ( ), ( ( sup ) ( ' ' y x x F y R A X x B ? ? ? ¡Ê = (5)</formula><p>This rule provides the generalized modus ponens when R is a fuzzy implication (A¡úB). F is called generalized modus ponens operator. Thus, if the operator F is expressed by the minimum function, the generalized modus ponens can be written as (6):</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">)) , ( ), ( (min( max ) ( ' ' y x x y B A A X x B ¡ú ¡Ê = ? ? ?

A complex system is "made of many components with many interactions" <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. So design of complex systems includes: 1) distribution and autonomy of system components, and 2) a very accurate modelling of communicative and interactional levels of these components.

Interactions between agents are fuzzy, since 1) the Autonomy of an agent is technically implemented by: 1) an independent process, 2) an individual memory (knowledge relationship (or affinities) between agents are weighted by a fuzzy value, and 2) interactions provide a relative interest (fuzzy evaluation) to agents based on roles that they play at a given time.</p><p>? Roles of agents are fuzzy, which means that all roles a fuzzy agent can play constantly have a fuzzy value.

Each universe i U is discretized in order to establish a set of features characteristic of the universe -this phase allows adjusting the granularity of the future agent-based system. Each characteristic entity is then agentified: creation of a fuzzy agent for each entity (corresponding to a bijection). 2) Acquisition and representation of knowledge of fuzzy agents. Each fuzzy agent acts autonomously according to its own knowledge. These include: membership degrees to different fuzzy subsets defined in the universe in which it operates, fuzzy rules that define its behaviour, fuzzy rules that define relationships or interactions with other fuzzy agents. </p></div>

Placed on the ground, the system triggers from its start watering a garden lawn during a specified period (output parameter of the system) with input parameters are soil humidity and the outside temperature (humidity Each fuzzy agent of the watering system activates the fuzzy rules contained in its knowledge base whose premises are under fuzzy inputs from the fuzzification of real inputs acquired periodically. These rules are of the form shown in (17).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D = 40 mn</head><p>To illustrate the activation of the above rules, we consider the following scenario <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig. 8</ref> (action a i ).

In this paper, we presented a model of fuzzy agents proposed for the modelling and design of complex systems (intelligent/smart systems, distributed systems, cooperative systems, assistance systems, etc.), where uncertainty and imprecision are considered. The correlated formal approach is: a) to define a modular architecture for designing the various fuzzy cognitive processes of fuzzy agents, b) to respect a rigorous methodology to acquire the fuzzy expertise of each fuzzy agent, c) to define the fuzzy behaviour and the evolving of the fuzzy roles of each fuzzy agents, and d) to define the model of fuzzy knowledge and fuzzy interactions of each fuzzy agent. A simple and pedagogical case study of fuzzy agentification (a smart watering system) was presented to illustrate our approach. For instance, consider a new temperature of 35 ¡ã and a constant humidity of 10% <ref type="figure">(Fig. 9)</ref> We are now working on two ways: 1) a better understanding and modelling of role changing of fuzzy agents during their activities for cooperative problem solving, and 2) application of the model to cooperative information systems (mainly in the fields of uncertain information management and support for the relevance of collaborative work), collaborative design (mainly in the field of fuzzy product configuration), and natural language processing (mainly in the fields of understanding and formalization of functional descriptions).</p></div>
