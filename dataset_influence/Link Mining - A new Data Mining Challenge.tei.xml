				<p>A key challenge for data mining is tackling the problem of mining richly structured datasets, where the objects are linked in some way. Links among the objects may demonstrate certain patterns, which can be helpful for many data mining tasks and are usually hard to capture with traditional statistical models. Recently there has been a surge of interest in this area, fueled largely by interest in web and hypertext mining, but also by interest in mining social networks, security and law enforcement data, bibliographic citations and epidemiological records. stance of multi-relational data mining (in its broadest sense); however, we use the term link mining to put an additional emphasis on the links-moving them up to first-class citizens in the data analysis endeavor. Link mining encompasses a range of tasks including descriptive and predictive modeling. Both classification and clustering in linked relational domains require new data mining algorithms. But with the introduction of links, new tasks also come to light. Examples include predicting the numbers of links, predicting the type of link between two objects, inferring the existence of a link, inferring the identity of an object, finding co-references, and discovering subgraph patterns. We define these tasks and describe them in more detail in Section 3.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Traditional data mining tasks such as association rule mining, market basket analysis and cluster analysis commonly attempt to find patterns in a dataset characterized by a collection of independent instances of a single relation. This is consistent with the classical statistical inference problem of trying to identify a model given a random sample from a common underlying distribution.</p><p>A key challenge for data mining is tackling the problem of mining richly structured, heterogeneous datasets. These datasets are typically multi-relational; they may be described by a relational database, a semi-structured representations such as XML, or using relational or first-order logic. However, the key commonalities are that the domain consists of a variety of object types and objects can be linked in some manner. In this case, the instances in our dataset are linked in some way, either by an explicit link, such as a URL, or by a constructed link, such as a join operation between tables stored in a database. Naively applying traditional statistical inference procedures, which assume that instances are independent, can lead to inappropriate conclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[24]</ref>. Care must be taken that potential correlations due to links are handled appropriately. In fact, record linkage is knowledge that should be exploited. Clearly, this is information that can be used to improve the predictive accuracy of the learned models: attributes of linked objects are often correlated and links are more likely to exist between objects that have some commonality. Link mining is a newly emerging research area that is at the intersection of the work in link analysis <ref type="bibr">[25; 14]</ref>, hypertext and web mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, relational learning and inductive logic programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[13]</ref> and graph mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[8]</ref>. Link mining is an in-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">BACKGROUND</head><p>Probably the most famous example of exploiting link structure is the use of links to improve information retrieval results. Both the well known page rank measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref> and hubs and authority scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[27]</ref> are based on the link structure of the web. These algorithms are based on the citation relation between web pages. Recently, many algorithms have been proposed which examine other relations, for example, Dean and Henzinger <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[9]</ref> proposed an algorithm based on co-citations to find related web pages, or finer-grained representation of the web pages <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Richardson and Domingos [40]</ref> combined content and link information with a relevance model to improve performance. A closely related line of work is hypertext and web page classification. This work has its roots in the information retrieval (IR) community. A hypertext collection has a rich structure that should be exploited to improve classification accuracy. In addition to words, hypertext has both incoming and outgoing links. Traditional IR document models do not make full use of the link structure of hypertext. In the web page classification problem, the web is viewed as a large directed graph. Our objective is to label the category of a web page, based on features of the current page and features of linked neighbors. With the use of linkage information, such as anchor text and neighboring text around each incoming link, better categorization results can be achieved. Chakrabarti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> proposed a probabilistic model to utilize both text and linkage information to classify a database of patents and a small web collection. They showed that naively incorporating words from neighboring pages reduces performance, while incorporating category information, such as hierarchical category prefixes, improves performance. Oh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[34]</ref> reported similar results on a col-lection of encyclopedia articles: simply incorporating words from neighboring documents was not helpful, while making use of the predicted class of neighboring documents was helpful. These results indicate that simply assuming that link documents are on the same topic, and incorporating the features of linked neighbors, is not generally effective. Another approach to hypertext and link mining combines techniques from inductive logic programming with statistical learning algorithms to construct features from related documents. A pioneering example is the work of Slattery and Craven <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref>. They proposed a model which goes beyond using words in a hypertext document making use of anchor text, neighboring text, capitalized words and alphanumeric words. Using these statistical features and a relational rule learner based on FOIL <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>, they proposed a combined model for text classification. Popescul et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref> also combined a relational learner with a logistic regression model to improve accuracy for document mining. Other approaches to link mining identify certain types of hypertext regularities such as encyclopedic regularity (in which linked objects typically have the same class) and co-citation regularity (in which linked objects do not share the same class, but objects that are cited by the same object tend to have the same class). <ref type="bibr">Yang et al. [48]</ref> gave an in-depth investigation of the validity of these regularities across several datasets and using a range of classifiers. They found that the usefulness of the regularities varied, depending on both the dataset and the classifier being used. Another link mining task that has received increasing attention is the identification of communities or groups, based on link structure. <ref type="bibr">Gibson et al. [20]</ref> gave a survey of work in discovering Web communities. <ref type="bibr">Kubica et al. [29]</ref> proposed a probabilistic model for link detection and modeling groups that makes use of demographic information and linkage information to infer group membership. Social and collaborative filtering has also been a focus of research that can be viewed as link mining. Kautz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[26]</ref> constructed social networks from Internet data and used the networks to guide users to experts who can answer their questions. <ref type="bibr">Domingos and Richarson [12]</ref> modeled the potential value of a customer, based on their network connections. Others have proposed generative probabilistic models for linked data. Cohn and Hofmann <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[7]</ref> proposed a probabilistic model for hypertext content and links. We also proposed a generative model for relational data, both content and links <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[17]</ref>. However, depending on the task, predictive models may be more appropriate. Examples of predictive modeling in relational domains include <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Bibliographic domain: In a bibliographic domain, the objects include papers, authors, institutions, journals and conferences. Links include the paper citations, authorship and co-authorship, affiliations, and the appears-in relation between a paper and a journal or conference.</p><p>Epidemiological Studies: In an epidemiology domain, the objects include patients, people they have come in contact with, and disease strains. Links represent contacts between people and which disease strain a person is infected with.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Link-Based Classification</head><p>The most straightforward upgrading of a classic data mining task to linked domains is link-based classification. In linkbased classification, we are interested in predicting the category of an object, based not just on its attributes, but on the links it participates in, and on attributes of objects linked by some path of edges. An example of link-based classification that has received a fair amount of attention is web-page classification. In this problem, the goal is predict the category of a web page based on words on the page, links between pages, anchor text and other attributes of the pages and the links. In the bibliographic domain, an example of link-based classification is predicting the category of a paper, based on its citations, the papers that cite it, and co-citations (papers that are cited with this paper). In the epidemiology domain, an example is the task of predicting the disease type based on characteristics of the people (note the arbitrary possible prediction direction) or predicting the person's age, based on the disease they are infected with and the ages of the people they have been in contact with.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">LINK MINING TASKS</head><p>As mentioned in the introduction, link mining puts a new twist on some classic data mining tasks, and also poses new problems. Here we provide a (non-exhaustive) list of possible tasks. We illustrate each of them using the following domains as motivations:</p><p>Web page collection: In a web page collection, the objects are web pages, and links are in-links, out-links and cocitation links (two pages that are both linked to by the same page). Attributes include HTML tags, word appearances and anchor text.</p><p>The goal in cluster analysis is to find naturally occurring subclasses. This is done by segmenting the data into groups, where objects in a group are similar to each other and are very dissimilar from objects in different groups. Unlike classification, clustering is unsupervised and can be applied to discover hidden patterns from data. This makes it an ideal technique for applications such as scientific data exploration, information retrieval, computational biology, web log analysis, criminal analysis and many others. There has been extensive research work on clustering in areas such as pattern recognition, statistics and machine learning. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) and k-means are two of the most common clustering algorithms. Probabilistic model-based clustering is gaining increasing popularity <ref type="bibr">[21; 45; 29]</ref>. All of these algorithms assume that each object is described by a fixed length attribute-value vector.</p><p>In the case of clustering linked data, even the definition of an element in a cluster is open to interpretation. We can cluster individual objects, collections of linked objects, or some other subgraph of the original. How do we compare the similarity of two of these elements or subgraphs, with potentially different structures? As this may necessitate tests for graphisomorphism, things will quickly become intractable. There has been surprisingly little work done on this type of link mining. Subdue <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[8]</ref> is the earliest line of research in this area. More recent approaches have been focused on efficiently finding frequently occurring patterns <ref type="bibr">[30; 23]</ref>; these are largely inspired by the apriori algorithm <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> for mining frequently oc-curring patterns. One very interesting new approach is ANF <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>, which attempts to compress a graph by approximating the neighborhood function for each node. Examples of clustering in web page collections range from finding hubs (pages that point to lots of pages of the same category) to identifying mirror sites. Examples of clustering in the bibliographic domain include finding groups of authors that commonly publish together, and discovering research areas, based on common citations and common publication venues and discovering. An example of clustering in the epidemiology domain is finding patients with similar sets of contacts or diseases with similar transmission patterns. Next, we turn to some more specific tasks that arise in link mining. These can often be seen as special cases of link-based classification or link-based cluster analysis.</p><p>In a web collection, predicting the number of links to a page is an indication of its authoritativeness; predicting the number of links from a page is an indication that the page is a hub. The page rank measure is also clearly related to the number of links.</p><p>In an epidemiological setting, predicting the number of links between a patient and people with whom they have been in contact (their contacts) is an indication of the potential for disease transmission; predicting the number of links between a particular disease strain and people infected by it is an indication of the strain's virulence.</p><p>Note that link counts can be generalized to paths. A count of the number of paths between two objects may be significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Identifying Link Type</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Record Linkage</head><p>There is a wide range of tasks related to predicting the existence of links. One of the simplest is predicting the type of link between two entities. For example, we may be trying to predict whether two people who know each other are family members, coworkers, or acquaintances, or whether there is an adviser-advisee relationship between two coauthors. The link type may be modeled in different ways. In some instances, the link type may simply be an attribute of the link. In this case, we may know the existence of a link between two entities, and we are simply interested in predicting its type. In our first example, perhaps we know there is some connection between two people, and we must predict whether it is a familial relation, a coworker relation or acquaintance relation. In other instances, there may be different kinds of links. These may be different potential relationships between entities; in the second example, there are two possible relationships: a co-author relationship and an adviser-advisee relationship. We may want to make inferences about the existence of one kind of link, having observed another type of link. A closely related task is predicting the purpose of a link. In a web page collection, the links between pages occur for different reasons. At the coarsest grain, links may be for navigational purposes or for advertising; it may be quite useful to distinguish between the two. The links may also indicate different relationships; the purpose of a link may be to refer to a professor's students, a student's friends, or a course's assignments.</p><p>Another important concept in link mining is identity uncertainty <ref type="bibr">[41; 37; 2]</ref>. In many practical problems, such as information extraction, duplication elimination and citation matching, objects may not have unique identifiers. The challenge is to determine when two similar-looking items in fact refer to the same object. This problem has been studied in statistics under the umbrella of record linkage <ref type="bibr">[46; 47]</ref>; it has also been studied in the database community for the task of duplicate elimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>.</p><p>In the link mining setting, it is important to take into account not just the similarity of objects based on their attributes, but also based on their links. In the bibliographic setting, this means taking into account the citations of a paper; note that as matches are identified, new matches may become apparent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">STATISTICAL MODELS FOR LINK MINING</head><p>Given the above collection of tasks, there are some unique challenges to applying statical modeling techniques. Here, we identify several; see also other papers in this volume, and papers in several recent workshops on learning statistical models from relational data <ref type="bibr">[18; 19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Logical vs. Statistical Dependences</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Predicting Link Strength</head><p>The first challenge in link mining and multi-relational data mining is coherently handling two different types of dependence structures:</p><p>Links may also have weights associated with them. In a web page collection, the weight may be interpreted as the authoritativeness of the incoming link, or its page rank. In an epidemiological domain, the strength of a link between people may be an indication of the length of their exposure.</p><p>link structure -the logical relationships between objects probabilistic dependency -the statistical relationship between attributes of objects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Link Cardinality</head><p>There are many practical inferences that involve predicting the number of links between objects. The number of links is often a proxy for some more meaningful property whose semantics depend on the particular domain:</p><p>In a bibliographic domain, predicting the number of citations of a paper is an indication of the impact of a paper-papers with more citations are more likely to be seminal.</p><p>Typically we limit the probabilistic dependence to be among objects that are logically related.</p><p>In learning statistical models for multi-relational data, we must not only search over probabilistic dependencies, as is standard in any type of statistical model selection problem, but potentially we must search over the different possible logical relationships between objects. This search over logical relationships has been a focus of research in inductive logic programming, and the methods and machinery developed in this community should be used to tackle this problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Feature Construction</head><p>A second challenge is feature construction in the multi-relational setting. The attributes of an object provide a basic description of the object. Traditional classification algorithms are based on these types of object features. In a link-based approach, it may also make sense to use attributes of linked objects. Further, if the links themselves have attributes, these may also be used. This is the idea behind propositionalization <ref type="bibr">[15; 28]</ref>. However, as others have noted, simply flattening the relational neighborhood around an object can be problematic. Several have noted that in hypertext domains, simply including words from neighboring pages degrades classification performance <ref type="bibr">[4; 34]</ref>. A further issue is how to deal appropriately with relationships that are not one-to-one. In this case, it may be appropriate to compute aggregate features over the set of related objects. We have found this works well for learning probabilistic relational models <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[16]</ref>, but this approach may not always be appropriate.</p><p>scribed fall under the category of link prediction. A difficulty here is that the prior probability of a link among any set of individuals is typically quite low. While we have had some success with simple probabilistic models of link existence <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[17]</ref>, we believe this is an area where there is much research to be done. A further challenge is the discovery of common relational patterns or subgraphs; some progress has been made in this area <ref type="bibr">[8; 30; 10]</ref>; however, this is an inherently difficult problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Object Identity</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Collective Classification</head><p>A third challenge is classification using a learned model. A learned link-based model specifies a distribution over link and content attributes, which may be correlated based on the links between them. Intuitively, for linked objects, updating the category of one object can influence our inference about the categories of its linked neighbors. This requires a more complex classification algorithm than for a propositional learner. Iterative classification algorithms have been proposed for hypertext categorization <ref type="bibr">[4; 34]</ref> and for relational learning <ref type="bibr">[33; 45; 44]</ref>. The general approach of iterative classification has been studied in numerous fields, including relaxation-labeling in computer vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[22]</ref>, inference in Markov random fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref> and loopy belief propagation in Bayesian networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[32]</ref>. Some approaches make assumptions about the influence of the neighbor's categories (such as that linked objects have similar categories); we believe it is important to learn how the link distribution affects the category. As an example, this allows us to learn the notion of hubs -e.g., a computer science department homepage is likely to point to a lot of professor homepages.</p><p>A final challenge is identity detection. How do we infer aliases, i.e., determine that two objects refer to the same individual? As mentioned earlier, some work has been done in this area by several research communities, but there is a great deal of room for additional work. Another aspect of this challenge is whether our statistical models refer explicitly to individuals, or only to classes or categories of objects. In many cases, we'd like to model that a connection to a particular object or individual is highly predictive; on the other hand, if we'd like to have our models generalize and be applicable to new, unseen objects, we also have to be able to model with and reason about generic collections of objects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Effective Use of Unlabeled Data</head><p>Recently there has been increased interest in learning using a mix of labeled and unlabeled data. General approaches include semi-supervised learning, co-training and transductive inference. There are some the unique ways in which unlabeled data can be used to improve classification performance in relational domains:</p><p>There has been a growing interest in learning from linked data, which are described by a graph in which the nodes in the graph are objects and the edges/hyper-edges in the graph are linksor relations-between objects. Tasks include hypertext classification, segmentation, information extraction, searching and information retrieval, discovery of authorities and link discovery. Domains include the world-wide web, bibliographic citations, criminology and bio-informatics, to name just a few. Learning tasks range from predictive tasks, such as classification, to descriptive tasks, such as the discovery of frequently occurring sub-patterns. We have given a brief summary of some of the work in this area, and some of the challenges in link mining. Link mining is a promising new area where relational learning meets statistical modeling; we believe many new and interesting machine learning research problems lie at the intersection, and it is a research area "whose time has come" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[11]</ref>.</p></div>
