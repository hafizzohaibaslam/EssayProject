Each agent's heading is updated using a local rule based on the average of its own heading plus the headings of its "neighbors."

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>There is a large and growing literature concerned with the coordination of groups of mobile autonomous agents. Included here is the work of Czirok et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> who propose one-dimensional models which exhibit the same type of behavior as Vicsek's. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, Toner and Tu construct a continuous "hydrodynamic" model of the group of agents, while other authors such as Mikhailov and Zanette <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> consider the behavior of populations of self propelled particles with long range interactions. <ref type="bibr">Schenk et al. determined</ref> interactions between individual self-propelled spots from underlying reaction-diffusion equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Meanwhile, in modeling biological systems, Gr¨¹nbaum and Okubo use statistical methods to analyze group behavior in animal aggregations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. This paper and, for example, the work reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> are part of a large literature in the biological sciences focusing on many aspects of aggregation behavior in different species.</p><p>In addition to these modeling and simulation studies, research papers focusing on the detailed mathematical analysis of emergent behaviors are beginning to appear. For example, Lui et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> use Lyapunov methods and Leonard et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and Olfati and Murray <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> use potential function theory to understand flocking behavior, and ?gren et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> uses control Lyapunov function-based ideas to analyze formation stability, while Fax and Murray <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Desai et al. [18]</ref> employ graph theoretic techniques for the same purpose.</p><p>The one feature which sharply distinguishes previous analyzes from that undertaken here is that this paper explicitly takes into account possible changes in nearest neighbors over time. Changing nearest neighbor sets is an inherent property of the Vicsek model and in the other models we consider. To analyze such models, it proves useful to appeal to well-known results <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> characterizing the convergence of infinite products of certain types of nonnegative matrices. The study of infinite matrix products is ongoing <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and is undoubtedly producing results which will find application in the theoretical study of emergent behaviors.</p><p>Vicsek's model is set up in Section II as a system of simultaneous, one-dimensional recursion equations, one for each agent. A family of simple graphs on vertices is then introduced to characterize all possible neighbor relationships. Doing this makes it possible to represent the Vicsek model as an -dimensional switched linear system whose switching signal takes values in the set of indices which parameterize the family of graphs. The matrices which are switched within the system turn out to be nonnegative with special structural properties. By exploiting these properties and making use of a classical convergence result due to Wolfowitz <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, we prove that all agents' headings converge to a common steady state 0018-9286/03$17.00 ? 2003 IEEE heading provided the agents are all "linked together" via their neighbors with sufficient frequency as the system evolves. The model under consideration turns out to provide a graphic example of a switched linear system which is stable, but for which there does not exist a common quadratic Lyapunov function.</p><p>In Section II-B, we define the notion of an average heading vector in terms of graph Laplacians <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and we show how this idea leads naturally to the Vicsek model as well as to other decentralized control models which might be used for the same purposes. We propose one such model which assumes each agent knows an upper bound on the number of agents in the group, and we explain why this model has convergence properties similar to Vicsek's.</p><p>In Section III, we consider a modified version of Vicsek's discrete-time system consisting of the same group of agents, plus one additional agent, labeled 0, which acts as the group's leader. Agent 0 moves at the same constant speed as its followers but with a fixed heading . The th follower updates its heading just as in the Vicsek model, using the average of its own heading plus the headings of its neighbors. For this system, each follower's set of neighbors can also include the leader and does so whenever the leader is within the follower's neighborhood defining circle of radius . We prove that the headings of all agents must converge to the leader's provided all agents are " linked to their leader" together via their neighbors frequently enough as the system evolves. Finally, we develop a continuous-time analog of this system and prove under condition milder than imposed in the discrete-time case, that the headings of all agents again converge to the heading of the group's leader.</p><p>Because of this, it makes sense to represent headings at any finite time , as real numbers in . Of course it is entirely possible that in the limit as , a heading might approach the value ; any such limiting value is interpreted as a heading of 0. Analogous statement apply to all other models considered in the sequel. Accordingly, throughout the paper headings at any finite time , are represented as real numbers in . The explicit form of the update equations determined by (1) and (2) depends on the relationships between neighbors which exist at time . These relationships can be conveniently described by a simple, undirected graph 2 with vertex set which is defined so that is one of the graph's edges just in case agents and are neighbors. Since the relationships between neighbors can change over time, so can the graph which describes them. To account for this we will need to consider all possible such graphs. In the sequel we use the symbol to denote a suitably defined set, indexing the class of all simple graphs defined on vertices. The set of agent heading update rules defined by (1) and (2), can be written in state form. Toward this end, for each , define</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(3)</formula><p>where is the adjacency matrix of graph and the diagonal matrix whose th diagonal element is the valence of vertex within the graph. Then</p><p>II. LEADERLESS COORDINATION</p><p>The system studied by Vicsek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> consists of autonomous agents (e.g., points or particles), labeled 1 through , all moving in the plane with the same speed but with different headings. 1 Each agent's heading is updated using a simple local rule based on the average of its own heading plus the headings of its "neighbors." Agent 's neighbors at time , are those agents which are either in or on a circle of pre-specified radius centered at agent 's current position. In the sequel denotes the set of labels of those agents which are neighbors of agent at time . Agent 's heading, written , evolves in discrete-time in accordance with a model of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(1)</formula><p>where is a discrete-time index taking values in the nonnegative integers , and is the average of the headings of agent and agent 's neighbors at time ; that is <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> where is the heading vector and is a switching signal whose value at time , is the index of the graph representing the agents' neighbor relationships at time . A complete description of this system would have to include a model which explains how changes over time as a function of the positions of the agents in the plane. While such a model is easy to derive and is essential for simulation purposes, it would be difficult to take into account in a convergence analysis. To avoid this difficulty, we shall adopt a more conservative approach which ignores how depends on the agent positions in the plane and assumes instead that might be any switching signal in some suitably defined set of interest.</p><p>Our goal is to show for a large class of switching signals and for any initial set of agent headings that the headings of all agents will converge to the same steady state value . Convergence of the to is equivalent to the state vector converging to a vector of the form where . Naturally, there are situations where convergence to a common heading cannot occur. The most obvious of these is when one agent-say the th-starts so far away from the rest that it never acquires any neighbors. Mathematically, this would mean not only that is never   <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> at any time , but also that vertex remains an isolated vertex of for all . This situation is likely to be encountered if is very small. At the other extreme, which is likely if is very large, all agents might remain neighbors of all others for all time. In this case, would remain fixed along such a trajectory at that value in for which is a complete graph. Convergence of to can easily be established in this special case because with so fixed, (4) is a linear, time-invariant, discrete-time system. The situation of perhaps the greatest interest is between these two extremes when is not necessarily complete or even connected for any , but when no strictly proper subset of 's vertices is isolated from the rest for all time. Establishing convergence in this case is challenging because changes with time and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(4)</ref> is not time-invariant. It is this case which we intend to study. Toward this end, we denote by the subset of consisting of the indices of the connected graphs in . Our first result establishes the convergence of for the case when takes values only in . Theorem 1: Let be fixed and let be a switching signal satisfying , . Then</p><p>Theorem 2: Let be fixed and let be a switching signal for which there exists an infinite sequence of contiguous, nonempty, bounded, time-intervals , , starting at , with the property that across each such interval, the agents are linked together. Then</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(6) (5)</formula><p>where is a number depending only on and . It is possible to establish convergence to a common heading under conditions which are significantly less stringent that those assumed in Theorem 1. To do this we need to introduce several concepts. By the union of a collection of simple graphs, , each with vertex set , is meant the simple graph with vertex set and edge set equaling the union of the edge sets of all of the graphs in the collection. We say that such a collection is jointly connected if the union of its members is a connected graph. Note that if such a collection contains at least one graph which is connected, then the collection must be jointly connected. On the other hand, a collection can be jointly connected even if none of its members are connected.</p><p>It is natural to say that the agents under consideration are linked together across a time interval if the collection of graph encountered along the interval, is jointly connected. Theorem 1 says, in essence, that convergence of all agents' headings to a common heading is for certain provided all agents are linked together across each successive interval of length one (i.e., all of the time). Of course there is no guarantee that along a specific trajectory the agents will be so linked. Perhaps a more likely situation, at least when is not too small, is when the agents are linked together across contiguous intervals of arbitrary but finite length. If the lengths of such intervals are uniformly bounded, then in this case too convergence to a common heading proves to be for certain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> A simple graph with vertex set V = f1; 2; . . . ; ng and edge set E is connected if has a "path" between each distinct pair of its vertices i and j where by a path (of length m) between vertices i and j is meant a sequence of distinct edges of of the form (i; k ); (k ; k ); . . . (k ; j). is complete if has a path of length one (i.e., an edge) between each distinct pair of its vertices.</p><p>where is a number depending only on and . The hypotheses of Theorem 2 require each of the collections , , to be jointly connected. Although no constraints are placed on the intervals , , other than that they be of finite length, the constraint on is more restrictive than one might hope for. What one would prefer instead is to show that (6) holds for every switching signal for which there is an infinite sequence of bounded, nonoverlapping but not necessarily contiguous intervals across which the agents are linked together. Whether or not this is true remains to be seen.</p><p>A sufficient but not necessary condition for to satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem 2 is that on each successive interval , take on at least one value in . Theorem 1 is thus an obviously a consequence of Theorem 2 for the case when all intervals are of length 1. For this reason we need only develop a proof for Theorem 2. To do this we will make use of certain structural properties of the . As defined, each is square and nonnegative, where by a nonnegative matrix is meant a matrix whose entries are all nonnegative. Each also has the property that its row sums all equal 1 (i.e.,</p><p>). Matrices with these two properties are called stochastic <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The have the additional property that their diagonal elements are all nonzero. For the case when (i.e., when is connected), it is known that becomes a matrix with all positive entries for sufficiently large <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. It is easy to see that if has all positive entries, then so does . Such and are examples of "primitive matrices" where by a primitive matrix is meant any square, nonnegative matrix for which is a matrix with all positive entries for sufficiently large <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. It is known <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> that among the eigenvalues of a primitive matrix, there is exactly one with largest magnitude, that this eigenvalue is the only one possessing an eigenvector with all positive entries, and that the remaining eigenvalues are all strictly smaller in magnitude than the largest one. This means that for , 1 must be 's largest eigenvalue and all remaining eigenvalues must lie within the open unit circle. As a consequence, each such must have the property that for some row vector . Any stochastic matrices for which is a matrix of rank 1 is called ergodic <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Primitive stochastic matrices are thus ergodic matrices. To summarize, each is a stochastic matrix with positive diagonal elements and if then is also primitive and, as a result, ergodic. The crucial convergence result upon which the proof of Theorem 2 depends is classical <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and is as follows.</p><p>Theorem 3 (Wolfowitz): Let be a finite set of ergodic matrices with the property that for each sequence of positive length, the matrix product is ergodic. Then for each infinite sequence, there exists a row vector such that</p><p>The finiteness of the set is crucial to Wolfowitz's proof. This finiteness requirement is also the reason why we've needed to assume contiguous, bounded intervals in the statement of Theorem 2.</p><p>In order to make use of Theorem 3, we need a few facts concerning products of the types of matrices we are considering. First, we point out that the class of stochastic matrices with positive diagonal elements is closed under matrix multiplication. This is because the product of two nonnegative matrices with positive diagonals is a matrix with the same properties and because the product of two stochastic matrices is stochastic. Second, we will use the following key result. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Lemma 1: Let be a set of indices in for which is a jointly connected collection of graphs. Then the matrix product is ergodic.</p></div>

This condition is tight in the sense that one can find a finite set of matrices with joint spectral radius , whose infinite products converge to zero despite the fact that there does not exist common quadratic Lyapunov function for the set. From this one can draw the conclusion that sets of matrices with "large" are not likely to possess a common quadratic, even though all infinite products of such matrices converge to zero. This can in turn help explain why it has proved to be necessary to go as high as to find a case where a common quadratic Lyapunov function for a family of does not exist.</p></div>

More precisely, (19) would be true if there were a single positive-definite matrix such that all of the matrices were negative definite. Although each can easily be shown to be discrete-time stable, there are classes of for which that no such common Lyapunov matrix exists. While we have not been able to construct a simple analytical example which demonstrates this, we have been able to determine, for example, that no common quadratic Lyapunov function exists for the class of all whose associated graphs have 10 vertices and are connected. One can verify that this is so by using semidefinite programming and restricting the check to just those connected graphs on ten vertices with either nine or ten edges.</p><p>It is worth noting that existence of a common quadratic Lyapunov function for all discrete time stable matrices in some given finite set , is a much stronger condition than is typically needed to guarantee that all infinite where is the average heading error vector <ref type="formula">(22)</ref> and, for each , is the symmetric matrix</p><p>known in graph theory as the Laplacian of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. It is easily verified that equations <ref type="formula">(20)</ref> to (21) do indeed define the Vicsek model. We have elected to call the average heading error because if at some time , then the heading of each agent with neighbors at that time will equal the average of the headings of its neighbors.</p><p>In the present context, Vicsek's control (21) can be viewed as a special case of a more general decentralized feedback control of the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> where for each , is a suitably defined, nonsingular diagonal matrix with th diagonal element .

Application of this control to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> </p><note type="other">would result in the closed-loop system (26) This means that the eigenvalues of must be smaller than 1 since</note><p>. From these properties it clearly follows that the eigenvalues of must all be between 0 and 1, and that if is connected, then all will be strictly less than 1 except for one eigenvalue at 1 with eigenvector . Since each is of the form , each possesses all of these properties. Let be a fixed switching signal with value at time . What we'd like to do is to prove that as , the matrix product converges to for some row vector . As noted in the Section II-A, this matrix product will so converge just in case Note that the form of <ref type="formula">(26)</ref> implies that if and were to converge to a constant values , and , respectively, then would automatically satisfy . This means that control (24) automatically forces each agent's heading to converge to the average of its neighbors, if agent headings were to converge at all.

For simplicity and without loss of generality we shall henceforth assume that the rows of form a basis for the orthogonal complement of the span of . This means that equals the identity , that , and, thus, that each is symmetric. Moreover, in view of (17) and the spectral properties of the , , it is clear that each , must have a real spectrum lying strictly inside of the unit circle. This plus symmetry means that for each , is negative definite, that is negative definite and thus, that is a common discrete-time Lyapunov matrix for all such . Using this fact it is straight forward to prove that Theorem 1 holds for system (26) provided the are defined as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> with . In general, each is a discrete-time stability matrix for which is negative definite only if . To craft a proof of Theorem 2 for the system described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>, one needs to show that for each interval on which is a jointly connected collection of graphs, the product is a discrete-time stability matrix and <ref type="formula">(29)</ref> To proceed we need to review a number of well known and easily verified properties of graph Laplacians relevant to the problem at hand. For this, let be any given simple graph with vertices. Let be a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the valences of 's vertices and write for 's adjacency matrix. Then, as noted before, the Laplacian of is the symmetric matrix . The definition of clearly implies that . Thus, must have an eigenvalue at zero and must be an eigenvector for this eigenvalue. Surprisingly is always a positive semidefinite matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Thus, must have a real spectrum consisting of nonnegative numbers and at least one of these numbers must be 0. It turns out that the number of connected components of is exactly the same as the multiplicity of 's eigenvalue at 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Thus, is a connected graph just in case has exactly one eigenvalue at 0. Note that the trace of is the sum of the valences of all vertices of . This number can never exceed and can attain this high value only for a complete graph. In any event, this property implies that the maximum eigenvalue of is never larger that . Actually, the largest eigenvalue of can never be larger than <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>is negative definite. This is a direct consequence of the following proposition.</p><p>Proposition 1: If is a jointly connected collection of graphs, then is a negative-definite matrix.</p><p>In the light of Proposition 1, it is clear that the conclusion Theorem 2 is also valid for the system described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. A proof of this version of Theorem 2 will not be given.</p><p>To summarize, both the Vicsek control defined by and the simplified control given by achieve the same emergent behavior. While latter is much easier to analyze than the former, it has the disadvantage of not being a true decentralized control because each agent must know an upper bound (i.e., ) on the total number of agents within the group. Whether or not this is really a disadvantage, of course depends on what the models are to be used for.</p><p>The proof of Proposition 1 depends on two lemmas. In the sequel, we state the lemmas, use them to prove Proposition 1, and then conclude this section with proofs of the lemmas themselves.</p><p>Lemma 3: If is a jointly connected collection of graphs with Laplacians , then which is valid for . Since all matrices in (35) are positive semidefinite, any vector which makes the quadratic form vanish, must also make the quadratic form vanish. Since any vector in the kernel of each matrix has this property, we can draw the following conclusion: kernel span In this section, we consider a modified version of Vicsek's discrete-time system consisting of the same group of agents as before, plus one additional agent, labeled 0, which acts as the group's leader. Agent 0 moves at the same constant speed as its followers but with a fixed heading . The th follower updates its heading just as before, using the average of its own heading plus the headings of its neighbors. The difference now is that each follower's set of neighbors can include the leader and does so whenever the leader is within the follower's neighborhood defining circle of radius . Agent 's update rule, thus, is of the form <ref type="formula">(38)</ref> where as before, is the set of labels of agent 's neighbors from the original group of followers, and is the number of labels within . Agent 0's heading is accounted for in the th average by defining to be 1 whenever agent 0 is a neighbor of agent and 0 otherwise.</p><p>The explicit form of the update equations exemplified by (38), depends on the relationships between neighbors which exist at time . Like before, each of these relationships can be conveniently described by a simple undirected graph. In this case, each such graph has vertex set and is defined so that is one of the graph's edges just in case agents and are neighbors. For this purpose we consider an agent-say -to be a neighbor of agent 0 whenever agent 0 is a neighbor of agent . We will need to consider all possible such graphs. In the sequel we use the symbol to denote a set indexing the class of all simple graphs defined on vertices . We will also continue to make reference to the set of all simple graphs on vertices . Such graphs are now viewed as subgraphs of the . Thus, for , now denotes the subgraph obtained from by deleting vertex 0 and all edges incident on vertex 0.</p><p>The set of agent heading update rules defined by (38) can be written in state form. Toward this end, for each , let denote the adjacency matrix of the -agent graph and let be the corresponding diagonal matrix of valences of . Then, in matrix terms, (38) becomes their leader across an interval just when the -member group consisting of the agents and their leader is linked together across . Note that for the -agent group to be linked to its leader across does not mean that the -agent group must be linked together across . Nor is the -agent group necessarily linked to its leader across when it is linked together across . Our main result on discrete-time leader following is next.</p><p>Theorem 4: Let and be fixed and let be a switching signal for which there exists an infinite sequence of contiguous, nonempty, bounded, time-intervals , , starting at , with the property that across each such interval, the -agent group of followers is linked to its leader. Then <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(40)</ref> The theorem says that the members of the -agent group all eventually follow their leader provided there is a positive integer which is large enough so that the -agent group is linked to its leader across each contiguous, nonempty time-interval of length at most . In the sequel, we outline several ideas upon which the proof of Theorem 4 depends.</p><p>To begin, let us note that to prove that (40) holds is equivalent to proving that where is the heading error vector . From (39) it is easy to deduce that satisfies the equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(41)</ref> where for , is</p><p>Note that the partitioned matrices <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(43)</ref> are stochastic where, for</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(44)<label>(39)</label></formula><p>where is now a switching signal whose value at time , is the index of the graph representing the agent system's neighbor relationships at time and for , is the diagonal matrix whose th diagonal element is 1, if is one of 's edges and 0, otherwise. Much like before, our goal here is to show for a large class of switching signals and for any initial set of follower agent headings, that the headings of all followers converge to the heading of the leader. For convergence in the leaderless case we required all -agents to be linked together across each interval within an infinite sequence of contiguous, bounded intervals. We will need a similar requirement in the leader following case under consideration. Let us agree to say that the agents are linked to the leader across an interval if the collection of graphs encountered along the interval is jointly connected. In other words, the agents are linked to To proceed, we need a few more ideas concerned with nonnegative matrices. In the sequel, we write whenever is a positive matrix, where by a positive matrix is meant a matrix with all positive entries. For any nonnegative matrix of any size, we write for the largest of the row sums of . Note that is the induced infinity norm of and consequently is sub-multiplicative. We denote by , the matrix obtained by replacing all of 's nonzero entries with a 1. Note that if and only if . It is also true for any pair of nonnegative matrices and with positive diagonal elements, that . Moreover, in view of Lemma 2, any such pair of matrices must also satisfy and . Let be a given set of indices in . It is possible to relate the connectedness of the collection to properties of the matrix pairs . Let us note first that for any , the indices of the nonzero rows of are precisely the labels of vertices in which are connected to vertex 0 by paths of length 1. More generally, for any integer , the indices of the nonzero rows of are the labels of vertices in connected to vertex 0 by paths of length less than or equal to . Hence, for such , the nonzero rows of the sum must be the labels of vertices in the union of the collection which are connected to vertex 0 by paths of length less than or equal to . It follows that if is jointly connected, there must be a value of sufficiently large so that . Since any vertex in a connected graph with vertices is reachable from any other vertex along a path of length of at most , it follows that if is jointly connected, then , . Now it is easy to see from the definitions of the and in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(42)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(44)</ref> respectively, that , . We have proved the following lemma.</p><p>Lemma 5: Let be any set of indices in for which is a jointly connected collection of graphs.

Proposition 2 actually implies that any finite product will be a discrete-time stability matrix provided there is a set of indices for which i) each occurs in the set at least times and ii) is a jointly connected collection of graphs. From this it is not difficult to see that any finite product will be ergodic provided is a jointly connected collection of graphs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> It is possible to use this fact together with Wolfowitz's theorem (Theorem 3) to devise a proof of Theorem 4, much like the proof of Theorem 2 given earlier. On the other hand, it is also possible to give a simple direct proof of Theorem 4, without using Theorem 3, and this is the approach we take.</p><p>Proof of Theorem 4: Let denote the set of all subsets of with the property that is a jointly connected collection. The constraints on imply that takes on every value in one such subset on every interval , . Let be the number of elements in . Then for any integer there must be at least one subset in whose elements are each values of at least times on any sequence of contiguous time-intervals. Set , and let be the least upper bound on the lengths of the intervals, , . By assumption, . Let denote the state transition matrix defined by , and , ,. Then . To complete the theorem's proof, it is, therefore, enough to show that is applied to the open-loop discrete-time heading model <ref type="formula">(55)</ref> The continuous-time analog of <ref type="formula">(55)</ref> is the integrator equation <ref type="formula">(56)</ref> where now takes values in the real half interval . On the other hand, the continuous time analog of (54) has exactly the same form as (54), except in the continuous time case,</p><p>, and are continuous-time variables. Unfortunately, in continuous time control laws of this form can lead to chattering because neighbor relations can change abruptly with changes in agents' positions. One way to avoid this problem is to introduce dwell time, much as was done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. What this means in the present context is that each agent is constrained to change its control law only at discrete times. In particular, instead of using <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(54)</ref> where is a pre-specified positive number called a dwell time and is an infinite time sequence such that , .</p><p>In the sequel we will analyze controls of this form subject to two simplifying assumptions.

These assumptions enable us to write as (58)</p><p>IV. LEADER FOLLOWING IN CONTINUOUS TIME where , and are as before, is the Laplacian of , and is a piecewise constant switching signal with successive switching times separated by time units. Application of this control to the vector version of (56) results in the closed-loop continuous-time leader-follower model</p><p>Our aim here is to study the convergence properties of the continuous-time version of the leader-follower model discussed in the last section. We begin by noting that the update rule for (59) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Using this fact and the structure of the F it is also not difficult to show that any finite product F F 1 1 1 F will be a discrete-time stability matrix provided only that f ;</p><p>; . . . ;</p><p>g is a jointly connected collection of graphs.</p><p>In analogy to the discrete-time case, let us agree to say that the agents are linked to the leader across an interval between switching times and , if the collection of graphs encountered along the interval, is jointly connected. Much like before, our goal here is to show for a large class of switching signals and for any initial set of follower agent headings, that the headings of all followers converge to the heading of the leader. For convergence, we shall continue to require there to exist infinite sequence of bounded, nonoverlapping time-intervals across which the -agent group is linked to its leader. However, unlike the discrete-time case we shall not require this sequence of intervals to be contiguous.</p><p>Theorem 5: Let , and be fixed and let be a piecewise-constant switching signal whose switching times satisfy , . If there is an infinite sequence of bounded, nonoverlapping time-intervals , , with the property that across each such interval the -agent group of followers is linked to its leader, then matrix exponentials in (66) depend continuously on the . In view of the definition of and the definitions of the in (64),</p><p>However This, (65), (67) and the sub-multiplicative property of the induced infinity norm imply that (68) Set and note that (60)</p><p>Theorem 5 states that will converge to , no matter what the value of , so long as is greater than zero. This is in sharp contrast to other convergence results involving dwell time switching such as those given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, which hold only for sufficiently large values of . Theorem 5 is a more or less obvious consequence of the following lemma. From this and (70), it now follows that <ref type="formula">(69)</ref>  must also be nonnegative with positive diagonal elements. But , where is the identity, so the same must be true of . Moreover which means that and, thus, that is stochastic. In summary, is a stochastic matrix with positive diagonal entries.</p><p>Equations <ref type="formula">(72)</ref>- <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(74)</ref>  As stated in the abstract, the main objective of this paper has been to provide a theoretical explanation for behavior observed in the simulation studies reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. We refer the interested reader to Vicsek's paper and references cited therein, for a more thorough description of the model considered and for data documenting the simulation studies performed.</p><p>The theorems in this paper all provide convergence results for rich classes of switching signals and arbitrary initial heading vectors. Of course as soon as one elects to interpret these results in the context of heading models for mobile autonomous agents, one needs to add qualifications, because the actual switching signal generated along a particular model's trajectory would have to depend on the model's initial heading vector. To make such a dependence explicit (and to run meaningful simulations) more complete models would have to be defined. In carrying out this step, one can expect to obtain a variety of results. For example, with very large agent sensing regions (i.e., very large) and agents initially near each other, one would expect enough connectivity along resultant trajectories for convergence to a common heading to occur. On the other hand, with widely distributed initial agent positions and very small, one would expect to see a bifurcation of the group into distinct subgroups with different steady state headings. In other words, a complete deterministic understanding of the flocking problems we've considered would require both more complete agent motion models as well as an understanding of the nonlinear feedback process upon which actually would depend. An alternative probabilistic approach might enable one to circumvent or at least simplify the analysis of the feedback process.</p><p>Some versions of the Vicsek model and others considered in this paper may ultimately find application in coordination of groups of mobile autonomous agents. Of course before this can happen many compelling issues such as collision avoidance, and the effects of disturbances, noise, sensing errors, vehicle modeling errors, etc. would have to be satisfactorily addressed. For example, the collision avoidance question might also be approached by replacing the point models implicitly used in this paper, with the model of a bumper-like "virtual shell" within which each agent vehicle is constrained to remain <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>While the analysis in this paper is deterministic and does not address the noise issue, the results obtained suggest that to understand the effect of additive noise, one should focus on how noise inputs effect connectivity of the associated neighbor graphs. Simulation results presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> indicate that when noise intensity in the system is fixed, there is a phase transition as the density of the agents is increased, i.e., there is a critical density after which all agents eventually become aligned. It is possible that this phenomenon can be adequately explained using percolation theory of random graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>The results of this paper have been extended to the case where there are inter-agent forces due to attraction, repulsion and alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The new results indicate that the convergence arguments used in this paper also apply to the more general problem considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> under similar assumptions regarding the connectivity of the graph representing the nearest neighbor relationships.</p><p>The convergence proof for Vicsek's model presented in Section II relies heavily on Wolfowitz's theorem. By generalizing some of the constructions Wolfowitz used in his proof, it is possible to develop a convergence result for a continuous-time analog of the Vicsek model which is quite similar to Theorem 5.</p><p>In studying continuous-time leader-following, we imposed the requirement that all followers use the same dwell time. This is not really necessary. In particular, without much additional effort it can be shown that Theorem 5 remains true under the relatively mild assumption that all agents use dwell times which are rationally related. In contrast, the synchronization assumption may be more difficult to relax. Although convergence is still likely without synchronization, the aperiodic nature of 's switching times which could result, make the analysis problem more challenging.</p><p>The use of simply averaging rules such as those discussed in this paper can sometimes have counter-intuitive consequences which may be undesirable in some applications. For example the average of headings 0.01 and is so this might cause two agents with headings both close to 0, to both approximately reverse direction to a heading of on the next step. It would be of interest to determine how update rules might be modified to avoid this type of behavior. Of course issues along these lines would not arise at all if the systems we've considered were modeling other physically significant variables such as agent speed or temperature where one could take all of rather than just as the set in which the take values. The models we have analyzed are of course very simple and as a consequence, they are probably not really descriptive of actual bird-flocking, fish schooling, or even the coordinated movements of envisioned groups of mobile robots. Nonetheless, these models do seem to exhibit some of the rudimentary behaviors of large groups of mobile autonomous agents and for this reason they serve as a natural starting point for the analytical study of more realistic models. It is clear from the developments in this paper, that ideas from graph theory and dynamical system theory will play a central role in both the analysis of such biologically inspired models and in the synthesis of provably correct distributed control laws which produce such emergent behaviors in man-made systems.</p><p>Ali Jadbabaie received the B.S. degree (with high honors) from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, and the Ph.D. degree in control and dynamical systems (CDS) from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), <ref type="bibr">Pasadena, in 1995</ref><ref type="bibr">Pasadena, in , 1997</ref><ref type="bibr">Pasadena, in , and 2000</ref> From October 2000 to July 2001, he was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the CDS Department at Caltech.
