<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The aim of any expertistoform judgments rationally, ideally coinciding with an objective truth. In reality, expert opinions are only partially based on an individual's objective assessment of the data because opinions are often formed under conditions of fundamental uncertainty: data are scarce, the future is unpredictable and so subjectivityi nevitably biases opinion. This is particularly true in economics and finance where endogeneity reflects the causalr ole played by beliefs, e.g. stock prices go up because people believe that they will go up. This paper explores limits on effective formation of expert opinion given fundamental uncertainty. It has applications to formation of experto pinion and expert elicitation in ar ange of areas including academia, oil exploration, finance and scientific research. The focus is on deepening our understandingo fe xperto pinion formation and identifying the factors leading to inefficient outcomes in terms of the accumulation of knowledge and learning. In uncertain situations, peopleemploy heuristics and rules of thumb to guide their interpretation of events and this can create problems of cognitive bias, including group biases occurring whenb eliefst end to coincidew ith the prior opinions of others, creating herding and path dependency. This tendency to follow others may be magnified by others ocial influences including reputation-building and conformity preference. The relative impacts of the positive and negativee xternalities of social influences intensify as opinions spread from experts to amateurs, especially because amateurs seem to be more strongly susceptiblet os ocial influences. There are ar ange of social influences on opinion formation among academics and other experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baddeley, 2013)</ref>. Some social influences are valuable-for example, replicating results is av aluablea spect of scientific research and if ah ypothesis has genuinelybeen verified across arange of different studies, then that may be because it is a more plausible and probable hypothesis. The wisdom of collective opinion has been analyzed extensively. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> But social interactions can also distortt he path of learning and knowledge formation. Academics and other experts may, consciously or unconsciously, follow ag roup consensus. This may reflectagenuine accumulation of knowledge; more people may supportap articulart heory on the basis that, all things beinge qual, there is more evidence from others that it is true. At heory or hypothesis that has widespread supportm ay be, probabilistically, more likelyt ob et rue, and Bayesian models of social learning are based around the insight that the chances of al arge number of people supporting af alse hypothesis are smaller than the chances of al arge number of people supporting atruehypothesis. Also, supporting an existing hypothesismay reflect genuine verification and replication of results, and this is avaluable aspectofintellectual progress, particularly in the experimental sciences. So, supporting consensus views does not necessarily mean that those views are wrong. Problems emerge,however,when following aconsensus opinion reflects othermotivations not connected to the pursuits of knowledge and truth. This may lead to excessive weight beingassigned to apopular theory even in the face of contrary objective evidence.</p><p>This paper focuses on someofthe social motivations affecting the pathsofknowledge and explores the circumstances in which social influences are helpful -f or example, when social learning generates positive externalities by enabling others' decision-making -a nd situations in which social influences are not helpful -f or example, when negative externalities emerge because private benefits from adopting ac onsensus view lead researchers to discard/ignore valuable private information. In exploring impactsofsocial influences on learning and knowledge accumulation, some of the background principles explored focus on insightsf rom economics and social psychology including Keynes' analyses of sociopsychological factors( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Keynes 1936</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Keynes , 1937</ref>); Simon's insightsa bout rationality, including bounded and procedural rationality <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Simon 1955</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Simon , 1959</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Simon , 1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">and Tversky and Kahneman (1974)</ref> analyses of heuristics, biases and prospect theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Standard economic approachest olearning, beliefsa nd expectations</head><p>In economics, standard conceptions about belief and expectation are grounded in assumptions of strictlyr ational behavior.T he cornerstone is the rational expectations hypothesis (REH) -fi rst formulated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Muth(1961)</ref> and applied in afinancial context by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fama (1970</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fama ( , 1991</ref>. There are various versions. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The essential insights of REH focus on the complete use of currently available information to form forward-looking expectations of future outcomes. REH developed as ar esponse to the adaptive expectations hypothesis, which implied backward-looking expectations and systematic mistakes;inREH models, expectations are assumed to change randomly and only in response to unexpectednews so expectations follow ar andomw alk process and errors are not repeated. Knowledge is treated as aflow variable implicitly embedding the assumptionthat individual beliefs are flowing into astock of knowledge, which increases without limit.While stronger versions, usually associated with atomistic independent rational agents and perfect information, are inconsistent with social influences on opinion formation, others' opinions can in principle be embedded as part of arational agent's information set givenasymmetric information. A more important limitation of REH in the context of social influences on belief formation is the focus on equilibrium outcomes. REH models assume that rational agents adjust quickly to new information and therefore knowledge formation is not adisequilibrium process.</p><p>More recently, behavioral economists have developed models of learning drawing parallelswith psychological models of learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baddeley, 2013)</ref>. Mirroringinsightsfrom Joan Robinson and others about shifting equilibria, <ref type="bibr">Camerer (2003)</ref> analyzes the learning process via which equilibria are reached and arguest hat these processesa re potentially more important than equilibria-given that equilibria may shiftb efore they are found. <ref type="bibr">Camerer (2003)</ref> analyzes learning in terms of stocks and flows; new information flows (aboutpayoffs, others' strategies, etc.) are used to updatelearning 'attractions', which in turn represent stocks of information accumulating over time. Similar to stock concepts in economics, theseattractions can depreciate or decay over time.</p><p>Learning models in economics draw on insights from two different perspectives: belief learning models focus on strategic thinking out of equilibrium and are based on the hypothesis that peoplel earn about the strategies played by others and use probabilistic information about others' strategies to determinetheir own best course of action <ref type="bibr">(Cheung &amp;F riedman, 1997)</ref>. Reinforcement learning models have closer links with behaviorist psychology and focus on the impactso fp ast payoffs. Past payoffs will reinforce similar strategies as well as identical strategies <ref type="bibr">(Erev &amp;Roth, 1998</ref>). These models connectwith rewardl earningm odels in neuroeconomics, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Schultz's (2006)</ref> model of rewardp redictione rror that incorporates an adaptive learning approach allowing that people learn from their past mistakes;learning stops when people stop making mistakes. Reward learning, being similar in constructiont oa daptivee xpectations models,a lso implies that peoplemake systematic mistakes,and while this insight has been rejected by the rational expectations theorists, it is consistent with morer ecent insightsa bout heuristicsand biases in decision-making -a spioneered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tversky and Kahneman (1974)</ref> (discussed in moredetail below).</p><p>Hybrid learningm odels, incorporating both beliefs and reinforcement, have been developed.C amerer and Ho'se xperience weighted attraction (EWA)m odeln estsb elief learning and reinforcement learning models <ref type="bibr">(Camerer &amp;H o, 1999</ref>). Extensions of these models allow for phenomena such as forgetting, idiosyncratic beliefs, primacy effectsand recency effects. Economic models of learning also allow for decay of information over time, for example, in weighted fictitious play (WFP) versions of belief learning models. In contrasttoaCournot model in which agents respond to their opponent's laststrategy, in WFP models the play of others is assigned decreasing weightsover time.</p><p>While economic learning models offer significant progression from the restrictive approach associated with REH, they do nonetheless assume astrictly rational approach to learning and reward. They also assume that decisions are made on the basis of afrequentist approach to information:p eoplef ormulate judgmentsa ccording to quantitative information from the past. These approaches do not address the problem that information is not easily quantifiable. Fundamental immeasurable Knightian uncertainty is afeatureof many situations in which experts are seeking knowledge -w hetherabout the truth of an economicmodelorabout oil exploration. In learning and belief formation, experts may be affected by ar ange of influences, not only payoffs and others' strategies. In aw orld of uncertainty, learning is not astrictly quantitative process, and thisconstraint is addressed in analyses allowing bounded rationality, as explored below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Beliefs ande xpectationswith bounded rationality</head><p>Economic models tend to focus on mathematical, algorithmicdecision-making processes but expertbelief formation can be illuminated by adopting HerbertSimon's insights about bounded rationality and the limitstostrictly rational behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Simon, 1955</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Simon, , 1959</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Simon, , 1979</ref>. Simon formulates broader conceptions of rationality than thoseseen in standard economic models including satisficing and bounded rationality. He also makes adistinction between substantive rationality (based arounda lgorithmic, mathematical decision-making tools such as constrained optimization) and procedural rationality(in which decision-making is intuitive, inductive and the outcome of 'appropriate deliberation'). While the REH is consistent with substantive rationality, proceduralr ationality is consistent with concepts seen in behavioral economics including heuristics-quick decision-making rules of thumb. Thesofter conception of rationality associated with Simon's procedural rationality also matchesreal-world behavior more neatly <ref type="figure">(Baddeley,2 006)</ref>.</p><p>Linkedtobounded rationality, <ref type="bibr">Kahneman and Tversky (1979)</ref> analyze the efficacy of heuristical decision-making,i dentifyingarange of biases,w hich emerge from applications of heuristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Tversky &amp;Kahneman, 1974)</ref>. Based on arange of experimental studies,t hey identify three main heuristicsa nd related biases including the availability heuristic,r epresentativeness heuristic and anchoring/adjustment. With the availability heuristic,judgments of likelihood are madeaccordingtothe easy retrievability of relevant information; information about conventional opinions and commonly agreed hypotheses is more likelyt ob ea vailable and salient than unconventional opinions and anomalous findings. The representativenessh euristic is about judging the likelihood of events by reference to the likelihoodo fa pparently similar events. Use of the representativeness heuristic can create inertia in beliefsa nd backward-looking behavior in which recent, contraryr esults are discounted. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tversky and Kahneman's( 1974)</ref> experimental evidence on heuristics and biases, particularly the anchoringa nd adjustmenth euristic,a lso shows that judgments tend to be biased toward initial conditions and reference points generating status quo bias whenits eems easiest to stick with current opinion.</p><p>In addition to the heuristics and biases that lead people into mistakes, experimental evidence also reveal anumber of behavioral paradoxes, including the Ellsberg, Allais and Monty Hall paradoxes, which are inconsistent with standarda ssumptions about rational decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baddeley, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Kahneman and Tversky (1979)</ref>,i nacritique of expected utilityt heory (EUT), offer an alternative theoretical approach in the form of prospect theory. This alternative approach capturesviolations of EUT and REH including loss aversion, reference points, disposition effects and reflection effects. Nonlinear value and probability weighting functions are alsoincorporatedinto prospect theory and capture changing risk preferences, ambiguitya version,e tc. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">( Kahneman &amp;T versky, 1979)</ref>. Similarly, regret theory can capture constraints on real-world decision-making not addressedinEUT including the impact on utilityofregret or rejoicing about past choices not chosen <ref type="bibr">(Loomes &amp;Sugden, 1982)</ref>. Overall, these alternative theories from behavioral economics seem to offeraricher account of real-world decision-making. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Socialinfluences on expectations and beliefs</head><p>Building on the literature from behavioral economics, ar ange of social influences affecting the evolution of beliefs, including experto pinions,h as been identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baddeley, 2013)</ref>. These can be broadly categorized into informational influence -w hen others' opinions reveal information, and normative influence -w hen conformity generates satisfaction or lessens discomfort: resistingp eer pressure may generate awkwardness; conformity with others may give psychological reassurance. In social psychology, normative social influences can reflect social learning but will also be driven by other influences. Copying behaviors seen in children who have previously seen adults behaving violently may be driven by instinctive imitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bandura, Ross, &amp;Ross, 1961)</ref>. In Asch's line experiments -w hen subjectsare trickedbyexperimental confederates into making very simplevisual mistakes about the lengths of lines -p eoplemay be agreeing with others because conformity is relatively satisfying and/or less confusing <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Asch, 1955</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Asch, , 1956</ref><ref type="bibr">Bond &amp;Smith, 1996)</ref>. Behaving in destructive ways, e.g. in administering electric shocks or adopting aggressive behaviorsinprison role-play experiments, may reflectthe influences of authority figures and/or social identity and context <ref type="bibr">(Haney, Banks, &amp; Zimbardo, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Milgram, 1963)</ref>.</p><p>Conformity of opinion amonga cademics and experts is not generated in such stark settings, but lesser versions of thesesocial influences as identified by social psychologists may still play an important role. Youngr esearchers may instinctively imitate their supervisors and mentors. They are certainlyc onditioned to respect the authority of their supervisors and group leaders. In times of uncertainty, there is comfortinconforming to the views of ap articular academic 'tribe'. Some evidence of the latter was seen in the falloutf rom financial crisis when large groups of economists from both sides of the politicalspectrumpublicly expressed strong but polaropinions about the pros and cons of deficit reduction, even though real evidence about the best strategies simultaneously to achieve internal and externalmacroeconomic balance was patchy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Socialinfluences in economica nalysis</head><p>In economicm odels of social learning, reasoning is the outcome of aB ayesian process reflecting rational decision-making: individuals form probabilistic judgments about the likelihoodofanevent based on others' choices and thisgenerates herding and information cascades <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson &amp;H olt, 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson &amp;H olt, , 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Banerjee, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bikhchandani,H irshleifer, &amp; Welch, 1992</ref><ref type="bibr">Bikhchandani &amp;S harma, 2000</ref>). In thisa pproach, posterior probabilities reflect an amalgam of prior probabilities and inferred probabilistic judgments of others. AB ayesian approach partly explains the phenomenono fs ocial influence on expert opinion but even aB ayesian approach cannot explain intuitive decision-making, e.g. as illustrated by MontyHall paradox. Also, aBayesian approach assumes Knightian risk and quantifiable probabilities. In reality, al ot of experto pinion is, almost by definition, generated in aw orld of Knightianu ncertainty: quantifiable information about priors and conditional probabilities is unlikely to exist in an onergodic/reflexive world.</p><p>In the economics literature,s ocial influences more broadly defined are addressed in Keynes' <ref type="bibr">(1936,</ref><ref type="bibr">1937)</ref> analysis of social psychology and conventional behavior.Keynes, in analyzing the behavior of professional versus amateur speculators, emphasizes strongly the importanceo fp sychological factorsi na na pproach consistent with Simon's conception of proceduralrationality:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Downloaded by [Auckland University of Technology] at 18:27 01 November 2015</head><p>We should not conclude from this that everything depends on waves of irrational psychology ... We are merely reminding ourselves that human decisions affecting the future ... cannot depend on strict mathematical expectation, since the basis for making such calculations does not exist, and that it is our innate urge to activity which makes the wheels go round, our rational selves choosing between the alternatives as best we are able, calculating where we can, but often falling back for our motive on whim or sentiment or chance. <ref type="bibr">(1936, p. 162)</ref> In some ways, Keynes'a nalysisp arallels Bayesians ociall earninga pproachi nt hath e acknowledgesthatuncertainty andignorance will propelspeculators to look to otherswho mayhavebetterinformation.

Butfor Keynes, social influence,s pecifically in financial markets, is driven by ar ange of otherf actors beyond social learning includingb eautyc ontestsa nd payoff externalities, reputation-buildinga nd psychological benefits from conformity. With Knightian uncertainty and volatile expectations,c onventionalo pinion provides (ano ften unstable)a nchorf or beliefsa nd lullsanxiety.Infast-moving liquid markets, second-guessingothers' opinions in speculative beauty contests is reasonableand generatespayoffexternalities becausebuyingintoarising market acceleratesthe rise.These phenomenatakeholdbecause assets arebeing bought and sold very quickly, particularly in unregulatedfinancialmarkets.Reputations matter too: it is better to be conventionallyw rong than unconventionallyr ight.Atraderw ho loses? 1 millionwhenhis peersare also losing ?1 million might keep hisjob.Atrader wholoses ?1 millionw hile others arem akingn othing will almost definitely lose hisj ob.S imilarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bernheim (1994)</ref> arguest hatw henp eoplec area bout status,t heyw illc onform because departingfromsocialnorms willimpairstatusand this canexplain fads andcustoms.</p><p>These factorshave adifferential impact on speculatorsrelative to entrepreneurs. In a Schumpeterian view, imitationi saf acet of creatived estruction in entrepreneurship. For Keynes, while entrepreneurs also face uncertaintyand shifting expectations, they are more likely to be propelled by animal spirits and gut feel than by social influence because they are forced to take along-term view. This will mean that the contrarian entrepreneur is less vulnerable to herdingexternalities than the consensual speculator.</p><p>More recently, the limitations of aBayesian approach in aworld of bounded rationality are addressedinanalyses of heuristics and biases in expertelicitation,including analyses of group bias,h erding and bandwagon effects <ref type="bibr">(Baddeley, Curtis, &amp;W ood, 2004</ref>). Anchoring and adjustment can be affected by social influences when reference points are socially determined, and this will generateabias towardpopular existing opinions. Also, the identification of loss aversion in prospect theory has parallels with expert belief in the sense that the loss from disagreeing with the consensus is disproportionatelylarge relative to the gains from agreeing with the consensus. Contrarianism is less likelyb ecause its costs are disproportionatelyh igh, which connects with Keynes' (1936) insight that it is better to be conventionally wrongt han unconventionally right. This also parallels <ref type="bibr">Kahneman and Tversky's (1979)</ref> reflection effect -w hich postulates that peopleare riskseeking in the region of losses but risk-aversei nt he region of gains. Similarly, riskseeking behavior among contrariansi st he mirror image of risk-averse behavior among those conforming to ac onsensus opinion. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Am odelofsocial influences on expertbeliefs</head><p>Bringing togethert he various social influences explored above, the impacts on an individual of agreeing versus disagreeing with others are explored in this section. Imagine two competing hypotheses, both of which are initially novel and have no particular 'tribal' support. Following ap rocess described by analystso fi nformation cascades (see above), once one person has madeaparticularchoice, then the likelihood that others will follow alongi ncreaseso vert ime. This generates herdinge xternalitiesb ecause private information is lost when peoplefollow their predecessors disregardingprivateinformation suggesting another, better path. Each individual researcher focuses on the privatevalue of their beliefs in terms of ar ange of factors: most researchers have as incere interest in discovering the truth and this may be enabled by social learning if there is achancethat others know more. There are other motivations too including buildingr eputation, and psychological benefits from conforming to others' beliefs. Payoff externalities also emerge when ar esearcher is part of ag rowing group supporting ap articular hypothesis and this generates iterative, beauty contest styles of thinking. However, there are also rewards to originality and so if an individual researcher is agreeingwith alarge number of others, then their lacko fo riginality will start to incur costs in terms of slowed career progression. This is somewhat similar to aS chumpeterian process in which returns to conformity decline generating processes of creative destruction.</p><p>Embedding these ideas, researchersc an be divided into two broad types, the 'consensuals' and the 'contrarians', and the private rewards to aresearcher in each of these groups are illustrated in Figure1.</p><p>Forthe consensual researcher, privaterewards are first increasing and then decreasing in n -t he number of people adopting the consensus hypothesis. If aconsensual is joining a small elite of thinkersp ursuing ar elatively originali dea, then the valueo fj oining that group increases initially -r eflecting atype of first-mover advantage -b ut there are also benefits of reputation building, conformity with others, strategicthinking, etc. There may also be social benefits if consensual beliefs reflectg enuinelys uccessful attempts to replicater elatively novel findingsf rom otherr esearchers. This generates increasing privater ewardst hat interact with negative externalities; while it might be privately valuablef or the individual to go with the opinions of influential others, there are social costs in terms of negative herding externalities. As the proportion of the academic community joining the consensual group increases, the returns from following the consensual opinion will decrease.T he researchs trategy will be unoriginal and will contribute little to the accumulation of knowledge.</p><p>Fort he contrarianr esearcher, private rewards are declining in n ,b ut at ad ecreasing rate. If acontrarian is developing arelatively originalidea,the more that others pursuethe consensual approach, the moredisconnected the contrarian will become. Their reputation may be compromised, they will not benefit from the payoffexternalities created from the knowledge bubbles benefiting the consensuals. Also, the contrarians will not benefit from accretions to knowledge enabled by genuine social learning. But, while their rewards will diminish as n increases, as more and more people join the consensual group, the consensual opinion will cease to be an originaldevelopment and reputational impacts of adopting conventional beliefs will decrease;academia does, all things being equal,tend to rewardo riginality.A st he consensus view becomes more and more pedestrian, the contrarians' returns to originality will increase. Also, evidence may build up that refutes the conventional view, and the benefits from social learning will be erodedbythe type of negativeherding externalities identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Banerjee (1992)</ref>: privateinformation is lost as people follow the crowd, and without private information the conventional approach will stagnate. Overall, rewards from contrarianview will fall at adecreasing rate and may even start to increaseifparadigm shifts turn acontrarian into amaven/trend-setter.This change of rolem ay be enabled by the fact that contrarians may be better able to identify new knowledge; simulations have shownt hat contrarians explore epistemic landscapes more efficientlya nd comprehensively.</p><p>Figure1showsthat the gains to consensual versus contrarian beliefs are balanced at n * and thiswill be astable point. It is likely that this will reflectexcessive supportfrom the consensual view because al arge proportiono ft he rewards to consensual beliefsr eflect privateb enefits unrelated to the social benefit of increasing the stock of genuine knowledge. So the stable outcome will be associated with 'over-consensus', path dependency and group bias in expert opinion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions and policy implications</head><p>The model outlined above suggests that, on balance, the externalities from supporting a consensus view are negative, and therefore, there will be overreliance on the opinions of others. This tendency will be reinforced by the fact that expert opinions are affected by a range of behavioral influences including the opinions of particular people who have alot investedi naparticular hypothesis or approach -n amely prominent academics and researchg roup leaders.C onsensus will alsob ea ffected by identity: researchers, particularly younger researchers, may feel ag reater need to identify and belong to a particularg roup, particularly if it is ap restigious group. Emotions will affect beliefs because sticking with ac onsensual view may be less risky; if they hold unconventional views, researchers may fear reprisals in terms of career success. At worst, junior researchers may fear the penalties of whistle-blowing, for example, in the case of Diederik Stapel (a sociologist found to have inventeddata)who responded negatively to the questioning of his false data and findings <ref type="bibr">(Callaway,2011)</ref>. Overall, these factorscan lead to slowed,distorted accumulation of knowledge. Asimilar phenomenon will apply in otherareas including the formation of expectations in financial markets; in this context, misguided consensual opinions will exacerbate destabilizing speculation and create perverse incentives not only for traders and the financial sector but also for regulators and credit rating agencies.</p><p>Policies to moderate the negativei mpacts of myopic consensus include encouraging reasoned dissent, testing power structures, properm onitoring of established researchers, requiring researcherst op ublish data alongside their research papers (already a requirement for some journals), creating better incentives for rigorous replication in research, and actively encouraging researchers to consider opposing approaches. The central problem is that it may be difficultt oi mplement practical concrete initiatives without the support of prestigious academicsocieties and journals -m any of which will have muchi nvested in the status quo.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Surowiecki (2005)</ref> for an introductory survey of the literature. 2.
