			<abstract>
				<p>Cluster in graphs is densely connected group of vertices sparsely connected to other groups. Hence, for prediction of a future link between a pair of vertices, these vertices common neighbors may play different roles depending on if they belong or not to the same cluster. Based on that, we propose a new measure (WIC) for link prediction between a pair of vertices considering the sets of their intra-cluster or within-cluster (W) and between-cluster or inter-cluster (IC) common neighbors. Also, we propose a set of measures, referred to as W forms, using only the set given by the within-cluster common neighbors instead of using the set of all common neighbors as usually considered in the basic local similarity measures. Consequently, a previous clustering scheme must be applied on the graph. Using three different clustering algorithms, we compared WIC measure with ten basic local similarity measures and their counterpart W forms on ten real networks. Our analyses suggest that clustering information, no matter the clustering algorithm used, improves link prediction accuracy.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Many social, biological, and information systems can be naturally described as networks, where vertices represent entities (individuals or organizations) and links denote relations or interactions between vertices <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Networks or graphs are a powerful representation that has been employed in different tasks of machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM). This growing interest in the use of graph can be justified by the expressiveness of this representation and its applications include: supervised learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>; unsupervised learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>; and semi-supervised learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, to cite just a few.</p><p>An important scientific issue regarding network analysis that has attracted increasing attention in recent years is the link prediction. The link prediction problem aims to estimate the likelihood of the future existence of a link between two disconnected vertices in a network, based on the observed links <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Many methods for link prediction based on similarity between vertices have been proposed since similar vertices likely share the same relations (links). When the similarity between vertices is based solely on network structure, it is called structural similarity. Structural similarity measures can be classified in different ways, such as the based on local or global information, refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> for details.</p><p>Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Zhou et al. [30]</ref> systematically compared a number of structural similarity measures on real networks. According to the authors, global measure can provide higher accuracy, but its computation is very time-consuming and usually infeasible for large-scale networks, while local measure is generally faster but with lower accuracy.</p><p>Common Neighbors (CN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> is one of the simplest similarity measures based on local information that leads to a good performance. In networks with large clustering coefficient, i.e., if there are connections between a vertex a and two vertices b and c, probably there is a link between b and c, CN provides accurate predictions compared to measures based on global information <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The basic assumption of CN is that two vertices are more likely to be connected if they have more common neighbors. Thus, each common neighbor gives equal contribution to the connection likelihood. However, sometimes different common neighbors may play different roles and by identifying them may lead to more accurate prediction than CN <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. For instance, the common friends in a same social group of two people who do not know each other may contribute more to their possibly future friendship than their common friends from different social groups.</p><p>Furthermore, in recent experiments on synthetic and real-world networks, Feng and colleagues found that for a network with low clustering structure link prediction measures based on structural similarity perform poorly. Nonetheless, as the clustering structure of the network grows, the accuracy of these measures drastically improves <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Inspired by these results, here, we firstly apply a partitioning scheme to divide the network into communities and then we explicitly use the obtained clustering structure information in the link prediction.</p><p>Considering that, to the connection likelihood between a pair of vertices, their common neighbors may contribute in different ways depending on if they belong or not to the same cluster, here we propose a new measure (WIC) for predicting link between a pair of vertices using information from intra-cluster or within-cluster (W) and inter-cluster (IC) common neighbors of these vertices. Also, considering solely the subset of within-cluster common neighbors instead of the set of all common neighbors, we also propose other measures, called W forms, derived from the basic local measures. Consequently, a clustering scheme must be applied on the graph analyzed before computing these measures. Thus, using three different clustering algorithms: FastQ (FQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, an algorithm based on edge clustering coefficient (ECC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and WalkTrap (WT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. We compare the WIC measure with ten local similarity measures and their corresponding W forms on ten real networks. We show that cluster information about vertices, no matter the clustering algorithm used, improves the accuracy of link prediction over local similarity measures.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the WIC measure. In Section 3 we present ten different local similarity measures and their corresponding W forms. In Section 4 we present experimental results on ten real networks drawn from disparate fields. Finally, in Section 5 we present the conclusions and discuss future work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>We consider a scenario where new links of ten real networks from different fields must be predicted.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Datasets</head><p>The networks considered in our experiments are (i) Airline (AL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> (a network of US air transportation system), (ii) Football (FB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> (a network of American football games between Division IA colleges), (iii) Industry (IDT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> (a network of companies linked via cooccurrence in 35318 PR Newswire press), (iv) Karate (KT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> (a social network of friendships between members of a karate club), (v) Imdb (MN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>(this network contains movies linked if they share a producer), (vi) NetScience (NS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> (a network of coautorship between scientists), (vii) Political Blogs (PB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> (a network of the US political blogs.

The basic topological features <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> of these ten networks are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Experimental Results</head><p>In this section, we present and discuss the results of using the WIC measure (using ¦Ä = 0.001), the local similarity measures and their W forms. Each of the link prediction measures was implemented in C++ based on LPmade platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. We use the experimental setup presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. To test the prediction accuracy, the set of observed links, E, is randomly divided into two parts: the training set, containing 90% of the links, and the probe set, containing the remaining 10% of links. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> summarizes the prediction accuracy results, measured by AUC on the ten networks whose vertices have a cluster label assigned by one of three different algorithms (FQ, ECC and WT).</p><p>In general, WIC measure has better performance on six of ten networks. We notice this performance is obtained on networks with large clustering coefficient and large degree of heterogeneity -defined as H = k 2 / k 2 , where k denotes the network average degree -such as AL, PPI, IDT and RT, where measures using the set of all common neighbors have few remarkable differences. In addition, in different networks, several W forms outperform, with significant difference, their corresponding basic forms. Note that, the performance of our propo-sals are observed independently of the clustering algorithm used. PA has the worst overall performance.</p><p>To show how the cluster information, no matter the clustering algorithm used, improves the link prediction accuracy, we present two different analyses from the results of <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. In the first, we analyze the difference between WIC measure and five local similarity measures. In the second, we analyze the statistical distributions of performance of all measures to emphasize the differences between the W forms and their corresponding basic forms.</p><p>The measures for link prediction mostly used in the literature are CN, Jac and AA. PA is interesting for requiring minimal information and RA due its similarity to AA. To analyze the difference between WIC measure and these five measures, we use a post-hoc test <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> from the results of the <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> and whose analysis is shown in three diagrams in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. We show the critical difference (CD) on the top of each diagram. The axis in each diagram is the axis on which we plot the average ranks of measures. In the axis the lowest (best) ranks are in the left side. The measures analyzed have no significant difference, so they are connected by <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. The basic topological features of ten experimental networks. Where |V | and |E| are the number of vertices and links. NC?FQ, NC?ECC and NC?WT are the number of clusters found by the algorithms FQ, ECC and WT, respectively. Each entry for NC?FQ, NC?ECC and NC?WT represents the total number of clusters detected and the number of clusters with a single node, for example, the entry 141/136 for AL with NC?FQ means that the network has 141 clusters, detected by FQ algorithm, with 136 of these clusters are formed by a single node. C and r are clustering and assortative coeficient, respectively. H denotes the heterogeneity degree.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. The prediction accuracy measured by AUC on ten networks. At each vertex of each network is assigned a cluster label using three different clustering algorithms (FQ, ECC and WT). Each AUC value is obtained by averaging over 100 implementations with independently random divisions of training set and probe set. The entries corresponding to the highest accuracies among the evaluated measures are emphasized by black. a black line in each diagram. Although there is no significant difference between these measures, WIC measure has a better average ranking, which in turn is considerably larger than the average ranking of the next best measure (especially when using ECC and WT clustering algorithms). The average ranking of CN, Jac, AA and RA are closer to each other in the three diagrams. The PA has the worst overall average ranking. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the statistical distributions of performance of all measures analyzed. There is no single clear winner among the measures, however we can observe the following. First, all medians of accuracies obtained using W forms outperform their corresponding basic forms, no matter the clustering algorithm used, except for AA-W that is outperformed by a minimal margin by AA when using ECC algorithm. Second, while the median of WIC measure is always between 0.7 and 0.8, the medians of the W forms are always between 0.6 and 0.8, and the medians of the basic forms are always between 0.5 and 0.7. Furthermore, in most cases the difference between median of an W form and its basic form is considerable.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We proposed a new measure for link prediction in complex networks, called WIC measure. The WIC measure scores the likelihood of a link between a pair of vertices taking into account the clusters from which common neighbors of these vertices originated. This is, the measure uses the information denoted by high concentration of links within particular groups of vertices as well as by low concentration of links between these groups. Additionally, considering the subset of within-cluster common neighbors, we propose modifications to CN, Salton, Jaccard, S?rensen, HPI, HDI, LHN, AA and RA measures, obtaining their corresponding W forms.</p><p>Empirical analysis of our proposals compared with ten local similarity measures on ten real networks from different fields shows that there is no single clear winner but our proposals achieve better accuracies. Thus, the experiments carried out suggest that clustering information, independently of the clustering algorithm used, improves the link prediction accuracy. However the cost in the partitioning process must be considered. Finally, as social network analysis has become a hot topic in the last years, we intend to investigate how this proposal may be adapted to use semantics information of social networks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>WIC CN CN Jac Jac Sal Sal Sor Sor HPI HPI HDI HDI LHN LHN AA AA RA RA PA -PW (WT) 0 .Fig. 1 .Fig. 2 .</head><label>012</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
