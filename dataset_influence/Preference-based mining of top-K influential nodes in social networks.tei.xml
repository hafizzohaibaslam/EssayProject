			<abstract>
				<p>Many important applications can be generalized as the influence maximization problem, which targets finding a K-node set in a social network that has the maximum influence. Previous work only considers that influence is propagated through the network with a uniform probability. However, because users actually have different preferences on topics, such a uniform propagation can result in inaccurate results. To solve this problem, we have designed a two-stage mining algorithm (GAUP) to mine the most influential nodes in a network on a given topic. Given a set of users&apos; documents labeled with topics, GAUP first computes user preferences with a latent feature model based on SVD or a model based on vector space. Then to find top-K nodes in the second stage, GAUP adopts a greedy algorithm that is guaranteed to find a solution within 63% of the optimal. Our evaluation on the task of expert finding shows that GAUP performs better than the state-of-the-art greedy algorithm, SVD-based collaborative filtering, and HITS.</p>

Their experiments show that the A social network reflects a social structure made up of a set of individuals and ties among them, such as relationship, connections, and interactions. Online social networks such as FaceBook and LinkedIn have been remarkably popular for making friends and finding jobs, and other types of social networks include scientific collaboration networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, mobile phone networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and instant messaging networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Being very popular, social networks have a strong synergy with business applications. Among them, ''viral marketing'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> tries to select a set of users that will potentially influence a large number of other users to choose a product, where the influence works mostly by ''word-of-mouth''. Searching for domain experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> and finding the most important blogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> are other examples that can be solved with analysis on social networks.</p><p>Both ''viral marketing'' and searching for domain experts can be generalized as the influence maximization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>: given a social network and a parameter K , find a K -node set that eventually has the maximum influence, where influence propagates in the network according to a stochastic cascade model. In other words, the problem is to select top-K influential nodes in the network such that they eventually influence the most people in the network. Kempe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> have proved that finding the optimal solution to the influence maximization problem is NP-hard. However, a simple greedy algorithm can approximate the optimal solution greedy algorithm significantly outperforms the classic approach using degree-and centrality-based heuristics.</p><p>After Kempe's seminal work, later work <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> improved on the algorithm's efficiency and were scaled to larger social networks. However, all the algorithms follow the same diffusion process as in Kempe's work, where each active node has the same influence on other nodes. In reality, the diffusion process of different topics propagates differently in networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Topical Affinity Propagation (TAP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> models the topic-level social influence on large networks and demonstrates that different topics actually lead to different influence results. Although the influence graph generated from TAP reveals the influence on a fine-grain level, TAP was only applied to the problems of finding representative nodes or constructing the influential subgraphs. There is no research on the influence maximization problem taking the user preferences into account. Without considerations of user preferences, the results of influence maximization are often inaccurate for a specific topic.</p><p>We study the influence maximization problem with the consideration of user preferences. To account for user preferences during the influence propagation, we propose a two-stage algorithm, called Greedy Algorithm based on Users' Preferences (GAUP), for the influence maximization problem. Specifically, for a social network and a set of users' documents labeled with topics, our two-stage algorithm works as follows: the vector space model (VSM), popularly used in information retrieval. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2. We extend an independent cascade model to accommodate the  user preferences calculated from the first stage, and then use  a greedy algorithm to compute an approximate solution for the  influence maximization problem for a specific topic. This greedy  algorithm has a proven error bound of 37%.</ref> a total probability of 1 ? (1 ? p) c v,w to activate w once it becomes active. The above models do not consider topics and user preferences on different topics. Intuitively, the more preferences on topic T by v and its neighboring nodes, the more likely the influence will happen. Thus, we consider the activation probability p is not uniform, but is related to user preferences on a topic T .</p><p>We have evaluated our GAUP algorithm on an academic coauthor network DBLP.</p><p>1 Experimental results show that GAUP significantly outperforms the traditional greedy algorithm in terms of influence spread on specific topics. We compared GAUP with other popular algorithms for the task of searching for domain experts and found that GAUP is more effective than SVD-based collaborative filtering. In this extended version of our conference paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, our new experimental results show that (1) LSI-based user preferences are more effective than those of the VSM; and (2) compared with link-based HITS algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, GAUP produces more reliable results, because HITS suffers from the problem of topic drift.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses background. Section 3 elaborates the design of GAUP. Section 4 presents experimental results and validates the effectiveness of our approach. Section 5 summarizes related work. Finally, Section 6 concludes our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Approximation of influence maximization problem</head><p>The ''influence maximization problem'' is NP-hard. Thus, finding an optimal solution is generally hard. However, approximation algorithms do exist and can find solutions with proven guarantees, if the influence of a seed set is submodular, non-negative, and monotone. A function f (¡¤) is submodular if it satisfies a natural ''diminishing returns'' property: the marginal gain from adding an element to a set S is at least as high as the marginal gain from adding the same element to a superset of S. Formally, for all pairs of sets S ? T , a submodular function satisfies:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f (S ¡È {v}) ? f (S) ¡Ý f (T ¡È {v}) ? f (T ).

From the figure, we can observe that Random as the baseline performs very badly. GAUP performs significantly better than other algorithms when K ¡Ý 15. GAUP outperforms GA by about 10% when K is 15 and more than 30% when K is 20. This is because GAUP can find more important nodes with respect to the specified topic. When K is 5 or 10, GA finds nodes that can activate more nodes than GAUP (shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 2)</ref>. As a result, the cumulative influence of GA on the topic exceeds that of GAUP. CF performs worse than GA by about 30%, because CF does not consider the influence diffusion process. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 2</ref> compares the IS(S) of various algorithms in the IC model.

We first use the GAUP algorithm to generate two seed sets, comm and kdd, for topic SIGCOMM and SIGKDD, respectively.

In contrast, GAUP, CF, and HITS can successfully find networking experts. We verified that all these people have published in wellknown networking conferences. Apart from Jennifer Rexford, all four other experts selected by GAUP and CF are different. James F. Kurose appears in both GAUP and HITS. Joseph Naor published lots of papers at networking conferences, but none in SIGCOMM. This indicates that our algorithm can effectively find domain experts.</p><p>To further study the effectiveness of GAUP, CF and HITS, we designed the following experiments to compare GAUP and CF, and to demonstrate the topic drift problem of HITS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">GAUP vs. CF</head><p>With the GAUP and CF results given in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> it is generally hard to measure which set of users is better. To address this problem, we designed the following experiment. For the field of networks, we choose two topics, SIGCOMM and ICCCN. Then the GAUP and CF algorithms are run to find the top 5, 10, 15, and 20 experts. Finally, we consider experts that are found by both topics. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 3</ref> illustrates the results of these two algorithms. We can observe that for the top 5, 10, and 15 experts, CF finds none that appear in both topics. In contrast, GAUP discovers 2, 4, and 5 overlapping ones for the top 5, 10, and 15, respectively. CF only finds one overlapping for the top 20 users, in which case GAUP finds 7. <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> The seed set of GA, CF, and GAUP when K = 5.     This experiment shows that GAUP can find common experts for different sub-topics in a domain. Thus, these experts are more likely to be the most influential ones in the domain. The CF algorithm does not consider the influence spread process, and only finds experts for specific topics. As a result, CF does not produce results as good as GAUP.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Topic drift of HITS</head><p>The effectiveness of HITS depends on the quality of the initial set of nodes. Previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> has shown that HITS may suffer from topic drift. To illustrate this problem, we run the HITS algorithm with three different seed sets for topic SIGCOMM:</p><p>? 20-set: we select 20 users from the experts returned by GAUP and CF for topic SIGCOMM;</p><p>? 30-set: we choose 10 new users together with 20-set, where some of new users are not in the field of networks;</p><p>? 31-set: we add a new user, Wen Gao, to 30-set. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 7</ref> shows the top five experts found by the HITS algorithm for these three seed sets. The results of 20-set and 30-set only differ for one person, and all of them are well-known networking people. However, none of the results for 31-set is in the field of networks. This is because Wen Gao and its neighboring nodes are well connected in the graph generated by HITS. As a result, the most highly ranked authorities and hubs deviate from the original topic of SIGCOMM.</p><p>This experiment demonstrates that the quality of HITS is highly dependent on the seed set. Because GAUP does not need such seeds, a direct comparison of HITS and our GAUP is difficult. We emphasize that GAUP is more reliable than HITS for finding experts, because of the considerations for user preferences in the influence model. This experiment studies the effectiveness of LSI-based and VSM-based user preference models. For both approaches, we compute the top 30 users for the topic of SIGCOMM, where the top five users are illustrated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 8</ref>. For the top 30 users, the results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 4</ref>.</p><p>We verified that all these users are interested in networks, and all top five users have published more than five papers in SIGCOMM. In fact, two users, Donald F. Towsley and Lixia Zhang, appear in the top five places for both approaches. However, when looking at the top 30 users, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 4</ref> shows the VSM becomes less accurate, as only 20 out of 30 have actually published papers in SIGCOMM. In contrast, LSI achieves 29. This indicates that there may be subtle difference in a user's preference and the topic in SIGCOMM, which the VSM cannot capture, especially for the top 21-30 users. LSI models user preferences via latent variables and is more accurate.</p><p>In summary, the LSI approach performs better than the VSM. Because LSI does not rely on text content and uses only structure information among users, LSI is more applicable for social networks.</p></div>

GAUP also adopts matrix factorization, which is used to estimate user preferences for subsequent top nodes mining. The use of matrix factorization in GAUP differs from CF in that GAUP explicitly filters out many rows in the matrix to reduce the matrix size, while CF has to work with the whole matrix. The goal of CF is to find the most relevant items for a given user, which is different from our purpose of searching for the most influential users. Additionally, our experiments have shown that collaborative filtering alone cannot find the most influential nodes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Expert search</head><p>Previous work has proposed two ways to find experts. The first one leverages information retrieval techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. The P@NOPTIC Expert system <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> first collects all documents authored by an individual and concatenates them to create a ''persondocument''. Then, a standard document search system runs over these person-documents, where experts for an input query are returned as the people corresponding to the highest-ranked person-documents. An improvement by Balog et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> is to first collect relevant documents and then use them to find experts. The specific domain of an expert is modeled by keywords in the information retrieval approach. In contrast, our approach uses LSIcomputed hidden variables to represent user preferences.</p><p>The second method is the link-based method <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, which exploits the structure of social networks. Campbell et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> use a modified version of the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> algorithm to identify authorities. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> study the expertise finding problem in a social network of an online forum, where variants of PageRank and HITS are tested. Ghosh and Lerman <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> compared a number of influence metrics over For the influence maximization problem, we have proposed a new GAUP algorithm to mine top-K influential nodes in social networks based on user preferences. In contrast, previous work does not take user preferences into account and only considers a uniform probability model for influence diffusion. Our GAUP algorithm works in two stages. To compute user preferences in the first stage, we study two different models, an LSI model, to project user preferences into a reduced latent space, and a VSMbased model. GAUP adopts a greedy algorithm in the second stage to find the most influential nodes in the network for a topic.</p><p>Evaluation results with an academic social network demonstrate that our GAUP algorithm can maximize the influence spread on a topic. For the two models of user preferences, experimental results show that the LSI-based model is more accurate. We have compared GAUP with the SVD-based collaborative filtering algorithm and HITS for expert search, and have found that GAUP is more likely to find the most influential domain experts than collaborative filtering. In addition, GAUP is more reliable than HITS, because HITS suffers from the problem of topic drift.</p></div>

The rank of R and ? is r (r ¡Ü c ¡Ü n). All the entries of matrix ? are positive and stored in decreasing order of their magnitude. Typical usage of SVD keeps the k largest diagonal values of ? , thus producing a rank-k approximation matrix R k . Over all rank- the perspective of an initially inactive node v unfolds as follows: as time progresses, more and more of v's neighboring nodes become active; v may become active at some point because of this; and v's k matrices, R k minimizes the Frobenius norm ¡ÎR ? R k ¡Î. In other activation may also affects its neighboring nodes. Each node can switch from an inactive to active state, but not the opposite. Popular influence diffusion models include the Linear Threshold Model, and the Independent Cascade Model (IC). In the linear threshold model, a node v becomes active if all its neighboring words, SVD provides the best lower rank approximations of the original matrix R. The selection of k should be large enough to capture all the important structures in the original matrix and small enough to avoid overfitting errors.</figDesc></figure>
