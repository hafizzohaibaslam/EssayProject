				<p>This paper studies the problem of spreading a product (an idea, cultural fad or technology) among agents in a social network. An agent obtains the product with a probability that depends on the spreading rate of the product as well as on the behavior of the agent&apos;s neighbors. This paper shows, using a mean field approach, that there exists a threshold for the spreading rate that determines whether the product spreads and becomes persistent or it does not spread and vanishes. This threshold depends crucially on the connectivity distribution of the network and on the mechanism of diffusion. for valuable comments and suggestions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Introducing a new product, technology or idea in the market is an issue of major socialeconomic relevance. Innovations do not necessarily spread at once, but often spread gradually through social and geographic networks. In fact, many products promote rather easily in a social system through a domino effect. In a first stage a few innovators adopt the product, and this makes more likely that their neighbors do the same, then their neighbors' neighbors and so forth. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that individuals' opinion heavily depends on the opinion of their interpersonal ties. Indeed, most products spread more efficiently due to "consumer-to-consumer dialogue" since these communication channels are more trusted and have greater effectiveness than mass media advertisements.</p><p>Another feature that favors diffusion is the coordination effect. In fact, there are many cases where in order to exploit the benefits of your product, you have to coordinate in your decision with your neighbors. A recent example is that of the mobile phones. They became popular in the mid 90's and, at present, almost every individual possesses a phone, which is considered as an essential commodity in developed countries. Apart from the intrinsic advantages that the new product might provide to its users, the fast spreading of it in the population is reinforced by more subtle aspects, such as fashion and benefits from coordinating in the decision with your contacts. Traditional marketing is being replaced by new strategies in which the product is turned into "epidemics" where consumers do the marketing themselves. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> This phenomenon shares common features with the contagion of an infectious disease in a population. The aim of this paper is to generalize existing epidemic models in order to accommodate them to describe diffusion in social and economic contexts.</p><p>In particular, we address the following question: How does the spreading pattern depend on the properties of the social network and on the diffusion (or contagion) mechanism?</p><p>We consider a large population with a complex pattern of interaction among agents. In fact, the population is described as a network structure where individuals (nodes) interact exclusively with a fixed group of neighbors (nodes with whom they are directly linked).</p><p>Traditionally, the study of networks has been a topic of graph theory. Graph theory, however, has concentrated in small networks with a high degree of regularity. This paper, however, focuses on the large-scale statistical properties of the network instead of on the properties of single vertices. For instance, the number of edges a node has -the connectivity of the node-is characterized by a distribution function P (k), which gives the probability that a randomly selected node has exactly k edges. We assume that the precise topology of the network is unknown and thus it is considered as a "random ensemble". These networks are referred as "random networks". The seminal papers on random networks developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Erdos and Renyi (1959)</ref>, define a random graph by a group of N nodes such that every pair of nodes is connected with a certain probability p &gt; 0. The graphs generated in this manner have a binomial connectivity distribution which tends to a Poisson distribution, as the size of the population tends to infinity. Hence, this distribution has its peak at the average connectivity. In other words, the majority of nodes have a similar connectivity.</p><p>Recent studies, however, show that most large complex networks are characterized by a connectivity distribution different to a Poisson distribution (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barab¨¢si and Albert, 1999</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barab¨¢si et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Faloutsos et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lijeros et al., 2001</ref>). For instance, the world wide web, Internet or the network of human sexual contacts, among others, have a power-law connectivity distribution, i.e. P (k) ? k ?¦Ã where ¦Ã ranges between 2 and 3. This implies that each node has a statistically significant probability of having a very large number of connections compared to the average connectivity which generates an extreme heterogeneity in the connectivity of agents. Such random networks are called scale-free. In this paper we focus on generalized random networks. These networks are random, in the sense that the link formation process is still determined in a stochastically independent fashion across nodes.</p><p>However, the underlying connectivity distribution is allowed to be arbitrary. Therefore, the "Erdos and Renyi " (Poisson) random networks, as well as the scale-free (power-law) random networks simply become particular cases of this general setup. Although this work attempts to be of general applicability, we pay special attention to the differential properties of Poisson and scale-free networks, due to their long tradition in the literature on social networks.</p><p>We therefore consider agents are connected by means of a generalized random network. Each agent, classified as either an "active" or a "potential" consumer, is represented by a node in the network. The transition from a potential to an active consumer depends on the intrinsic properties of the product as well as on the number and behavior of neighbors. Conversely, an active consumer becomes potential at an exogenously given rate. This reflects the idea that the technology in question is subject to a decay, obsolescence or breakdown. Therefore, with a certain probability, independent of the behavior of neighbors, an agent may need to replace the product and hence may become a potential consumer again.</p><p>The framework considered in this work is closely related to the so-called "susceptibleinfected-susceptible" (SIS) model, commonly used in epidemiology. Some paradigmatic examples that are described using the SIS model are the diffusion of sexually transmitted diseases in a sexual contact network or the spreading of a computer virus via Internet (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Pastor-Satorr¨¢s and Vespignani, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lloyd and May, 2001</ref>). Each agent is represented by a node and can be either "healthy" or "infected". In each time step a healthy node is infected at a certain rate if it is directly connected to at least one infected agent. Conversely, an infected agent is cured at another certain rate. This paper extends the SIS model by introducing a richer framework to reflect local dependencies or neighborhood effects. Unlike epidemiological models, where contagion events between pairs of individuals are independent, the effect that a single infected neighbor has on a given node depends critically on the states of the node's other neighbors. The SIS model considers the contagion of a disease as a linear function of the absolute number of infected neighbors, whereas the present model allows for non-linear mechanisms. Indeed, we could consider a concave mechanism where adding more active consumers in the neighborhood of an agent increases the chances that the agent becomes active, but with a decreasing marginal impact. Furthermore, the intensity of each interaction could depend on the total number of interactions. In other words, the more neighbors an agent has, the less significant any one of them becomes. Consequently, the contagion mechanism is not necessarily expressed in terms of the absolute number of a node's neighbors adopting the product, but could instead depend on the corresponding fraction of the neighborhood. One of the objectives of this work is to account for the differences in the results as we vary the mechanism of diffusion.</p><p>The theoretical results of our model are derived using the so-called mean field theory. This approach is commonly used in physics and biology since it provides a reasonable guide of the qualitative behavior of complex systems. Heuristically, it is a continuous time system where all decisions happen for certain at a rate proportional to the mean. Moreover, it simplifies the description of the exact contagion process by substituting local variables of the dynamics by their global mean values.</p><p>We show, using the mean field theory, that there exists a threshold for the degree of contagion (or spreading rate) of the product, such that, above the threshold the technology spreads and becomes persistent. This threshold depends crucially on two features: the mechanism of diffusion and the connectivity distribution of agents in the population. We also show that, when the contagion of the product only depends on the absolute number of active consumers among neighbors (i.e. the effect of the size of the neighborhood is absent), then networks with a higher variance have lower thresholds. Consequently, the diffusion of the product is easier and greater in scale-free networks than in Poisson networks, as expected from the recent empirical results (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barab¨¢si et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Faloutsos et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lijeros et al., 2001</ref>). In contrast, if the intensity of each interaction decreases in parallel with the number of neighbors, i.e. , the contagion of the product depends on the relative proportion of active consumers among neighbors, the results change significantly. In particular, if the probability that an individual becomes active is proportional to the fraction of neighboring active consumers, the threshold coincides for all networks. Finally, for concave diffusion functions there always exists a continuous transition from the absence to the existence of diffusion, whereas for some particular non-concave diffusion functions, a phase transition or hysteresis phenomenon occurs.</p><p>The formal framework considered in this paper is close to the literature on epidemiology and complex systems, mentioned above, where the mean field theory is often used. The inspiration for this work, however, comes mainly from the literature on social and economic networks. Recent instances of this literature show that the pattern of interaction between individuals is crucial in determining the nature of outcomes. A wide number of papers have focused on the analysis of lattices; that is, regular networks in which all players have the same number of direct connections (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anderlini and Ianni, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Blume, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ellison, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Young, 2003)</ref>. One step beyond comes from Morris (2000) who has developed techniques to study coordination games in general networks, and from Calv¨®-Armengol and Jackson (2004) who deal with the diffusion of information on job opportunities in a population. The present paper shares a flavour with Morris (2000) and Calv¨®-Armengol and Jackson <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">(2004)</ref> but introduces important novelties. First, we study very general contagion mechanisms characterized by the fact that the transition from one individual state to the other (active to potential consumer and vice versa) is stochastic and asymmetric. Second, we consider complex random networks rather than networks with a deterministic geometric form.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. The model is contained in Section 2. Section 3 introduces the mean field theory. The main results of the paper are presented in Section 4. Then, we introduce some stylized examples in Section 5. Further results are considered in Section 6 and in Section 7 we run some simulations of the original dynamics in order to test the validity of the results based on the mean field theory. Finally, Section 8 concludes. Some proofs have been relegated to an Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The model 2.1 Generalized random networks</head><p>Let N = {1, 2, ..., i, ...n} be a finite but large set of agents. Assume agents communicate one with another through certain channels which determine the social system. More precisely, each agent interacts only with her fixed group of neighbors which represents her personal and professional contacts. Let K i ? N be the set of neighbors of player i and let k i be its cardinality which is referred as her connectivity from here onwards. We assume that the network is undirected, i.e., if a node i is connected to j then j is connected to i as well. Assume that the pattern of interactions between agents is complex. Moreover, the network structure has a high degree of randomness and thus can only be described by its large-scale statistical</p><p>properties. Denote by P (k) to the connectivity distribution of the network, i.e. the fraction of agents in the population that have exactly k direct neighbors. Equivalently, P (k) is the probability that an agent chosen uniformly at random has connectivity k. Throughout this paper, the network is characterized by being "random" and having a connectivity distribution P (k) which is exogenously given. More precisely we consider a so-called generalized random network. These networks extend the Erdos-Renyi random graphs by incorporating the property of non-Poisson connectivity distributions. Formally, consider any connectivity distribution P (k) defined on N . Let ¦£ N,P be the collection of networks defined on N that display the degree distribution P (k). Then, a generalized random network is simply a statistical ensemble in which every network in ¦£ N,P is selected with equal probability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> One of the aims of this work is to explicitly account for the influence of P (k) in the spreading behavior of the product. For most of our results we will focus on the differential properties of the three following types of connectivity distributions:</p><p>(i) Scale-free networks</p><p>Scale-free networks are characterized by having a power-law connectivity distribution. In particular,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P (k) ¡Ø k ?¦Ã ,</formula><p>where ¦Ã ranges between 2 and 3. This property implies that there exists a significant proportion of agents with large connectivity with respect to the average (denoted by hki).</p><p>These are the "hubs" of the network.</p><p>(ii) Homogeneous networks</p><p>Homogeneous networks are such that all nodes have approximately the same connectivity.</p><p>In particular,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">? ? P (k) ? ? 0 if k 6 = hki 1 if k = hki</formula><p>Note that, the variance of P (k) is approximately zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(iii) Poisson networks</head><p>Poisson networks are characterized by having a Poisson connectivity distribution. In particular,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P (k) = 1 k! e ?hki hki k .</formula><p>It is straightforward to show that the variance in the connectivity of nodes for Poisson networks lies in between the variance of scale-free and homogeneous networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The diffusion mechanism</head><p>Assume there is a new product in the market. We focus on its spreading among the population N . To do so, consider that an agent i ¡Ê N can only exist in two discrete states</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">s i ¡Ê {0,1}</formula><p>, where s i = 0 if i is a "potential" consumer and s i = 1 if i is an "active" consumer. A potential consumer is an agent that does not have the product but is susceptible <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> For further details on generalized random networks the reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Newman (2003)</ref>.</p><p>of obtaining it if exposed to someone who does. An active consumer is an agent that has already adopted the product and so can influence her neighbors in favor of obtaining it.</p><p>Consider a stochastic continuous time dynamics process as follows. At time t, the state of the system is a vector</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">s t = (s 1t , s 2t , ...s it , ....s nt ) ¡Ê S n ¡Ô {0, 1} n ,</formula><p>where s it = 0 if i is a potential consumer at time t whereas s it = 1 if i is an active consumer at time t. Assume i is a potential consumer at time t. She becomes an active consumer at a rate that depends crucially on: her connectivity k i , the number of neighbors that are active consumers at time t (a i hereafter) and the spreading rate (or degree of contagion) of the product, denoted by ¦Í ¡Ý 0. More precisely, the transition rate from potential to active consumer is given by a function F (¦Í, k i , a i ) that determines the properties of the mechanism of diffusion. We assume independence of the spreading rate effect and the effect that the behavior of neighbors has over the agent's decision. Thus,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">F (¦Í, k i , a i ) = ¦Í ¡¤ f (k i , a i ),</formula><p>where f (k i , a i ), named as the diffusion function from here onwards, is a non-negative func-</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">tion only defined for (k i , a i ) ¡Ê N ¡Á N such that 0 ¡Ü a i ¡Ü k i .</formula><p>It is worth noting that, the connectivity of an agent is fixed throughout the dynamics. Instead, the number of active consumers among neighbors "a i " might change over time. We suppose that a necessary condition for the adoption of the product is that at least one neighbor has already adopted it. More precisely,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">f (k, 0) = 0 for all k ¡Ý 1. ( A -1 )</formula><p>Roughly speaking, the transition from a potential to an active consumer can be interpreted as follows. At a rate ¦Í any given agent becomes aware of the existence of the product -e.g.</p><p>through mass media advertisement-and considers the possibility of adopting it. The agent's final decision, however, depends crucially on her neighbors' behavior. More precisely, the agent responds to her neighbors current configuration by choosing an action according to some choice rule. The particular choice rule considered is characterized by f (k i , a i ).</p><p>Conversely, consider agent i ¡Ê N is an active consumer at time t. Then, i becomes a potential consumer at some stochastically constant rate ¦Ä &gt; 0 which indicates the rate at which the agent may need to replace the product because it is lost or deteriorated. Notice that, this transition is independent of her neighbors' behavior. It is implicit in this formulation that the cost of "maintaining" the product is approximately zero and thus agents never have incentives for getting rid of it. Finally, let us define the effective spreading rate of the product by ¦Ë = ¦Í ¦Ä .</p><p>For concreteness, we will now define formally what we mean by the mechanism of diffusion.</p><p>A diffusion mechanism is a pair m = (¦Ë, f (¡¤)) where ¦Ë denotes the effective spreading of the product and f (¡¤) denotes the diffusion function.</p><p>Notice that, since the transition rates only depend on the properties of the present state, the dynamics induced by the connectivity distribution P (k) and the diffusion mechanism m determines a continuous Markov chain over the space of possible states S n .</p><p>The aim of this work is to analyze whether and how the product spreads in the population.</p><p>Several questions raise as natural:</p><p>? Is there prevalence of the product in the long-run of the dynamics?</p><p>? Are small perturbations of the initial state in which there are no active consumers enough to converge to states with a positive fraction of active consumers?</p><p>? Is there a discontinuity (or phase transition) in the long-run proportion of active consumers as we increase ¦Ë?</p><p>In the next section, we partially respond to these question by describing when and how the product spreads in the population. The analytical results of the exact model are extremely complicated and thus will not be tackled in this paper. Nevertheless, to proceed, two complementary approaches can be considered. On the one hand, the analysis of the model can be simplified using the so-called mean field theory. This approach is described and studied in detail in the next section. On the other hand, we can simulate the dynamics in order to obtain numerical approximations of the results for the exact stochastic model. This second alternative will be tackled in Section 6 below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The mean field theory</head><p>The analytical study of this model can be undertaken in terms of a dynamical mean-field theory. Other reports show that mean-field approximations can be expected to give a reasonable guide to the qualitative behavior of complex dynamics. Before describing the theoretical framework, we will present some additional notation. Let ¦Ñ k (t) be the relative density of active consumers at time t with connectivity k. Consequently, ¦Ñ(t) = P k P (k)¦Ñ k (t) is the relative density of active consumers at time t. From here onwards, the state of the system at any given time t, will be characterized by the profile (¦Ñ k (t)) k¡Ý1 . Denote by ¦È(t)</p><p>to the probability that any given link points to an active consumer. Therefore, the probability that a potential agent with k links has exactly a neighboring active consumers is</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">? k a ? ¦È(t) a (1 ? ¦È(t)) (k?a)</formula><p>since this event follows a binomial distribution with parameters k and ¦È(t). Obviously, there is an approximation inherent in this formulation because we have assumed that ¦È(t) is the same for all vertices, when in general it too will be dependent on vertex connectivity and other local properties of the vertex. This is precisely the nature of a mean-field approximation.</p><p>Consider a potential consumer with k neighbors and a active consumers among them at time t. She becomes an active consumer at a rate ¦Íf(k, a). Thus, the transition rate from potential to active consumer for an agent with connectivity k is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">k e g ¦Í,k (¦È(t)) = X ¦Íf(k, a) ? k a ? ¦È(t) a (1 ? ¦È(t)) (k?a) . a=0</formula><p>The dynamical mean-field equation can thus be written as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">d¦Ñ k (t) dt = ?¦Ñ k (t)¦Ä + (1 ? ¦Ñ k (t))e g ¦Í,k (¦È(t)).<label>( 1 )</label></formula><p>Roughly speaking, equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">(1)</ref> says the following: the variation of the relative density of active consumers with k links at time t equals the proportion of potential consumers with k neighbors at time t that become active consumers (i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">(1 ? ¦Ñ k (t))e g ¦Í,k (¦È(t))) minus the</formula><p>proportion of active consumers with k neighbors at time t that become potential consumers</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(i.e. ¦Ñ k (t)¦Ä).</formula><p>Assume that the time scale of the dynamics is much smaller than the life-span of the agents in the population; therefore terms reflecting birth or death of individuals are not included.</p><p>Moreover, several assumptions are implicit in equation (1). First, we assume the size of the population is large, i.e. n ¡ú + ¡Þ. Second, we consider the so-called homogeneous mixing hypothesis. This implies, on the one hand, no correlation between the connectivity of connected agents and, on the other hand, an homogeneous distribution of initial adopters in the population. In addition, in each period, the only source of heterogeneity in the population considered is the connectivity of agents.</p><p>After imposing the stationary condition</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">d¦Ñ k (t) dt = 0 in equation (1) for all k ¡Ý 1, the equation,</formula><p>valid for the behavior of the system at large times is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">¦Ñ k = g ¦Ë,k (¦È) 1 + g ¦Ë,k (¦È) ,<label>( 2 )</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">k g ¦Ë,k (¦È) = 1 ¦Ä e g ¦Í,k (¦È) = X ¦Ëf (k, a) ? k a ? ¦È a (1 ? ¦È) (k?a) . a=0</formula><p>The exact calculation of ¦È for general networks is a difficult task. However, we can calculate its value for the case of a random network, in which there are no correlations among the connectivities of different nodes. For this case, it is straightforward to see that,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">¦È = 1 hki X kP (k)¦Ñ k ,<label>( 3 )</label></formula><p>k where hki is the average connectivity of the network, i.e. hki = P k kP (k). The system formed by the equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">(2)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">(3)</ref> determine the stationary values for ¦È and (¦Ñ k ) k . To solve this system, we should simply replace equation (2) in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">(3)</ref> and</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">obtain, ¦È = H ¦Ë (¦È),<label>( 4 )</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">H ¦Ë (¦È) ¡Ô 1 hki X kP (k) g ¦Ë,k (¦È) 1 + g ¦Ë,k (¦È) .

Note that, these values correspond to the set of fixed points of the function H ¦Ë (¦È).

For concreteness, we will define first the concepts of sustainable diffusion, positive diffusion and unique diffusion of the product.</p><p>Given P (k) and m, we say that there is sustainable diffusion of the product if there exists a locally stable state of the mean field dynamics with a positive fraction of active consumers.</p><p>The concept of stability required in this definition is the standard one. Roughly speaking, a state is stable if it is a stationary state of the dynamics resistant to small perturbations.</p><p>Notice that, sustainable diffusion implies that, under certain initial conditions, the dynamics converges to a state with a positive fraction of active consumers. Next, we will define the concept of positive diffusion.</p><p>Given P (k) and m, we say that there is positive diffusion of the product if, starting at any initial state ¦È 0 6 = 0, the mean field dynamics converges to a stable state with a positive fraction of active consumers.</p><p>Notice that, positive diffusion does not imply uniqueness of the non-null stable state. Thus, the long-run behavior of the dynamics can depend on the initial conditions. However, it implies that, if we slightly perturb the initial state with no active consumers, i.e. we introduce a "small" number of initial adopters, the dynamics leads towards a non-null stable state. Finally, the following definition addresses the global behavior of the dynamics.</p><p>Given P (k) and m, we say that there is unique diffusion of the product if there exists a unique stable state of the mean field dynamics with a positive fraction of active consumers.</p><p>In other words, in the case of unique diffusion, the long-run behavior of the dynamics does not depend on the initial conditions.</p><p>It is straightforward to show that the following implications hold;</p><p>unique diffusion ? positive diffusion ? sustainable diffusion</p><p>Notice that, the existence of a non-null solution of equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">(4)</ref> implies the existence of a non-null stable state ¦È * of the dynamics, which also implies sustainable diffusion of the product.</p><p>Let ¦Ñ k (¦Ë) be a function that provides for every given value of the effective spreading rate ¦Ë ¡Ý 0, the relative density of active consumers with connectivity k predicted in the long-run of the dynamics, when the initial state is taken to be infinitesimally close to the one with no active consumers. Moreover, let ¦Ñ(¦Ë) = P k P (k)¦Ñ k (¦Ë) be the degree of diffusion function.</p><p>The aim of this section is to describe in some detail the relationship between the connectivity distribution of the network P (k) and the mechanism of diffusion m with the spreading behavior of the product. It is straightforward to show that, given (A-1) the state with no active consumers (¦È = 0) is stationary. Thus, to spread the product in the population there must be an initial shock of active consumers. This section analyzes a situation where the initial state of the dynamics is such that there is a "small" proportion of initial adopters, i.e. ¦È 0 ? 0. One interpretation for this is that the firm interested in the diffusion of the product initially gives it "for free". It is reasonable to assume that the firm is going to choose a small number of initial adopters and then rely on the contagion process for the diffusion of it to a larger fraction of agents. Given the nature of the question, we will first focus on the concept of positive diffusion defined above. Unique and sustainable diffusion, will be studied later in the paper.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">k, 1)</ref>). Specifically, in order to assess the existence or not of some positive prevalence, it is enough to consider what happens in a neighborhood with only one active agent. As highlighted above, this is merely a consequence of the fact that, for positive diffusion to occur, the state with no active consumers has to be unstable. Notice that, If ¦Ë &gt; ¦Ë p then, in the long-run, the product spreads and becomes persistent in a fraction of the population. The degree of the diffusion, however, might depend on the initial conditions. If, on the contrary, we assume ¦Ë ¡Ü ¦Ë p then, if there is only a small fraction of initial adopters, in the long-run, the product will disappear from the market. In other words, we either never reach a state with a positive fraction of active consumers or, if we do, it must be because there is a sufficiently high "stock" of initial adopters.</p><p>The following corollary is obtained directly from the above result.</p><p>Corollary 2 If the transition rate from potential to active consumer is independent of the connectivity of the agent (i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">f (k, a) = f (k 0 , a) ¡Ô f (a) ? k, k 0 ¡Ý 0) then the threshold is ¦Ë p = 1 f (1) hki hk 2 i .</formula><p>One of the main conclusions obtained from Corollary 2 is that the threshold depends on the connectivity distribution P (k). In particular, it depends on the ratio between its first and second order moments. Therefore, if we compare two generalized random networks with the same average connectivity, the one with the highest variance has the lowest threshold. The reason for this is the following: the variance of the connectivity distribution P (k) is given</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">by var(k) = ? k 2 ? ? hki 2 , thus ? k 2 ? = var(k) + hki 2 .</formula><p>Since ¦Ë p is inversely proportional to the second order moment, if we compare two networks with the same average connectivity, the value of the variance determines the value of the threshold. As an illustration, consider the three types of networks introduced above -scale-free, homogeneous and Poisson-and assume they have the same average connectivity. Then it is straightforward to show that their thresholds are ranked as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">¦Ë SF p &lt; ¦Ë P H p &lt; ¦Ë p ,</formula><p>since this is also the ordering of their corresponding variances. Note also that for scale-free networks, the variance of the connectivity tends to infinity when the size of the population becomes arbitrarily large (i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">? k 2 ? ¡ú ¡Þ when n ¡ú +¡Þ). Consequently, ¦Ë SF p ¡ú 0. In other</formula><p>words, no matter how small the spreading rate is, positive diffusion of the product in the population will always occur. The intuition behind this result is the following. In scale-free networks there is a significant proportion of hubs, i.e., nodes with very high connectivity compared to the average. These nodes play a crucial role for the spreading of the product since they easily adopt the product due to their high connectivity. Furthermore, if they are active consumers, they are capable of influencing a significant fraction of individuals in the population.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">A model of diffusion with bounded rationality</head><p>Consider a population of agents N = {0, 1, ..., n}. As before, agents interact only with their fixed group of neighbors. The pattern of interaction among them is described through a social network where each node represents one agent and the connections among them are represented by links.</p><p>Let x be a new technology. Assume that the cost incurred by an individual i in case of adopting x is randomly determined by e c i . For the sake of concreteness, suppose</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">e c i ?

For simplicity, assume that, once adopting the product, the cost of maintaining it is zero.</p><p>Suppose that, if two players are neighbors, there is a pairwise interaction that can generate mutual payoffs. The common set of strategies is S = {0, 1} where s i = 1 means agents i is an active consumer whereas s i = 0 otherwise. For each pair of strategies s, s0 ¡Ê S, the payoff earned by a player i choosing s when interacting with her partner j choosing s0 is b &gt; 0 if both players are active consumers and zero otherwise. For the sake of concreteness assume b &lt; C. </p><formula xml:id="formula_25">a i b ? c i ¡Ý 0.</formula><p>Consequently, i's rate of transition from potential to active consumer is the probability that agent i's cost is below her benefits, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">? ? b P (e c i ¡Ü a i b) = f (a i ) = C b ? C a i if a i ¡Ü 1 if a i &gt; C b</formula><p>Note that, the reverse transition, i.e. from active to potential consumer, is never a best response of the player. Nevertheless, we assume that at a rate ¦Ä &gt; 0 the product deteriorates and needs to be replaced. If this were the case, agents have to re-consider the possibility of adopting it or not.</p><p>Observe that, here, the diffusion function only depends on the absolute number of active consumers among neighbors. In consequence, two agents with the same number of neighboring active consumers have the same probability of becoming active consumers and this is independent of their respective connectivities. In this case, the threshold for positive diffusion is equal to C b hki hk 2 i . Notice that the threshold not only depends on the connectivity properties of the network in the same way as shown in Corollary 2, but also on the two additional parameters introduced, i.e., C and b. This feature depends crucially on the specific context considered as illustrated through the alternative example presented below.</p><p>Consider now the setting presented above and assume that the intensity of each interaction decreases with the total number of interactions. For simplicity, assume that i's benefit from interacting with an active consumer if he becomes active is given by b ki . Also here, overall benefits are computed as the sum of the benefits obtained from each bilateral interaction.</p><p>Therefore, if we consider any potential consumer i with connectivity k i and with a i active consumers among her neighbors.

As before, this is independent of what might be the underlying network (scale-free, Poisson, homogeneous, etc.).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Simulations</head><p>In this section we develop simulations to test the validity of the mean-field approximations used throughout the paper. We generate two different random networks in terms of their connectivity distributions: (i) a scale-free (specifically, P (k) ¡Ø k ?3 ) network (ii) a Poisson network. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Both networks have a total of 1000 nodes and an average connectivity of approximately 9 neighbors per node. We consider the discrete version of the continuous dynamics used to derive the theoretical results. In this respect, we assume that, in every period one (and only one) agent is chosen to revise her "strategy". For the sake of concreteness, we have focused on testing the contents of the models in Section 5.2.</p><p>All figures presented below have in common the following characteristics. We represent how the number of active consumers (n(t), ordinate) changes as a function of time (t periods, abscissa) at different values of the spreading rate ¦Ë.

For each simulation, the initial condition is randomly chosen such that individuals are active in round t = 1 with probability 0.01.</p><p>In the first model of Section 5.2, we consider a diffusion function that depends linearly on the absolute number of active consumers in the neighborhood of an agent.

Observe that, as expected, the degree of diffusion is higher the higher the spreading rate is. Moreover, as the period increase, the number of active consumers increases as well. Also note that, for ¦Ë = 0.05 there is prevalence of the product in the long-run, thus this could indicate that, in this case, the threshold for positive diffusion tends to zero.</p><p>The graph in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> represents how the number of active consumers changes over a total of 5 ¡Á 10 4 periods for the Poisson network at three different values of the spreading rate (¦Ë = 0.05, 0.5 and 5; green, blue and red line, respectively). In contrast with the previous case, for ¦Ë = 0.05 there is no prevalence of the product in the long-run.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>The objective of this paper is to analyze how the diffusion of a new product or technology takes place on a social complex network. The network is characterized by one of its largescale statistical properties -the connectivity distribution-rather than by a specific geometric form (such as lines, circles, lattices and so forth). A wide class of diffusion dynamics (or mechanisms) has been considered. In all of them, the probability of agents adopting the product depends on the product's spreading rate and the behavior of the agents' closest neighbors.</p><p>The main contribution of this paper is to characterize the diffusion threshold in terms of the properties of the network and the diffusion mechanism. One of the principal findings is that the threshold depends crucially on the network considered when the intensity of each interaction is assumed to be independent of the neighborhoods size. More specifically, the higher the variance in the connectivity distribution of the network, the lower the threshold.</p><p>This implies, in particular, that scale-free networks are optimal for spreading the product in these contexts. In contrast with this result, if the diffusion mechanism considered is such that the intensity of each interaction is inversely proportional to the neighborhoods size, all networks have the same positive threshold. Finally, we also show that, for some particular diffusion mechanisms, there is a phase transition in the degree of the diffusion function. In other words, there is a discontinuity in the fraction of active consumers in the long-run of the dynamics as the spreading rate increases.</p><p>The simulations presented in the last section of the paper show that the theoretical results, obtained using mean field approximations, provide a reasonable guide of the qualitative properties and long-run predictions of the diffusion dynamics.</p></div>

A detailed proof of the Theorem is presented in the Appendix. The sketch of the proof, however, is the following. For every value of ¦Ë ¡Ý 0, the stationary states of the dynamics are given by the fix points of H ¦Ë (¦È). Notice that, assumption (A-1) implies that H ¦Ë (0) = 0 and therefore, as mentioned above, the state ¦È = 0 is stationary. Since g ¦Ë,k (¦È) ¡Ý 0 then 0 ¡Ü H ¦Ë (¦È) &lt; 1. In particular, this implies that, positive diffusion occurs if and only if the state ¦È = 0 is unstable (i.e. there exist an &gt; 0 such that H ¦Ë (¦È) &gt; ¦È for all ¦È ¡Ê (0, ,) ) or equivalently dH ¦Ë (¦È) d¦È c ¦È=0 &gt; 1. The threshold is obtained simply by solving for ¦Ë in this equation. A graphical illustration is provided in Figure 1.</figDesc></figure>

If this were the case, the player uses a myopic best response to update her strategy. Thus, the player compares the benefits obtained next period in the case of adopting with those obtained in case of remaining as a potential consumer. Assume that players interact with all their neighbors every period. Heuristically, this implies agents are continuously observing at all neighbors and thus benefits are computed as the sum of the benefits obtained from each bilateral interaction. Hence, a potential consumer i with connectivity k i and with a i active consumers among her neighbors becomes an active consumer iff,</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>sumers among neighbors and on the total number of neighbors. In particular, it depends on the fraction of active consumers among neighbors. It is straightforward to see that the threshold in this case equals ¦Ë p = C b independently of the connectivity of the network. Therefore, in this case, scale-free networks have no comparative advantage for diffusion pur- poses with respect to other networks. The intuition behind this result is the following. As in the previous example, once a "hub agent" is an active consumer this facilitates the contagion of the product due to her high connectivity. Nevertheless, hub agents in this case rarely become active since what influences their decision is the fraction of active neighbors and not the absolute number of active neighbors. It is precisely the interaction of these two opposite effects what generates the result. To conclude with this section, and building on the previous example, assume that the cost is no longer randomly determined but takes the fixed and known value c &lt; b. It is straight- forward to show that if this were the case, a potential consumer would adopt the product (with probability 1) if and only if the proportion of active consumer in the neighborhood would be above c b . Specifically, ? ? a f (k, a) = 1 if c b ? k ¡Ý 0 otherwise Notice that here the diffusion function is a discontinuous step-function. The threshold in this case has the following expression,</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><head>c</head><label></label><figDesc>] denotes the integer value of c . It is worth mentioning that, if b c ¡ú 0, the threshold coincides basically with the one obtained for the case in which the neighborhood effects are absent, that is, ¦Ë p = hki hk 2 i therefore implying that the threshold for scale-free networks tends to zero.</figDesc></figure>
