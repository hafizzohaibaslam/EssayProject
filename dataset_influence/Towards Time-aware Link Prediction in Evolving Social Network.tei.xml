				<p>Prediction of links-both new as well as recurring-in a social network representing interactions between individuals is an important problem. In the recent years, there is significant interest in methods that use only the graph structure to make predictions. However, most of them consider a single snapshot of the network as the input, neglecting an important aspect of these social networks viz., their evolution over time. in a variety of application scenarios: to predict the next academic collaborations between researchers, detection of unseen links in terrorist networks, and for suggesting new friendships in online social networking sites. In this work, we investigate the value of incorporating the history information available on the interactions (or links) of the current social network state. Our results unequivocally show that time-stamps of past interactions significantly improve the prediction accuracy of new and recurrent links over rather sophisticated methods proposed recently. Furthermore, we introduce a novel testing method which reflects the application of link prediction better than previous approaches. The link prediction problem has attracted immense interest in recent years, and a variety of techniques that operate on the graph/hypergraph structure of social networks are proposed. All link prediction methods address the following question: &quot;Given a pair of nodes u and v in the current social network, how likely is it that u will interact with v in the future?&quot;.</p>

Accurate prediction of new link formation or repeated occurrences of existing links is an important problem in this setting. Such link prediction is useful 1. We develop graph-based link prediction techniques that incorporate the temporal information contained in evolving social networks. In particular, we extend the local probabilistic model proposed by <ref type="bibr">Wang et al. in [19]</ref> to include timeawareness. We show how to incorporate edge weightspossibly derived from temporal features-into the state-ofthe-art link prediction methods, such as the Adamic-Adar distance based and rooted PageRank based techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

We introduce a novel testing method that evaluates the performance of different prediction algorithms in their ability to rank nodes from a neighborhood of a selected node. We propose two measures of the quality of the rankings, which focus on different aspects of rankings.</p><p>The 3rd SNA-KDD Workshop '09 (SNA-KDD'09), <ref type="bibr">June 28, 2009,</ref> We conducted an empirical evaluation of our techniques over two collaboration networks commonly used in the earlier linkprediction research -DBLP <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and astro-ph slice of ArXiv.</p><p>Our experiments show that incorporating time-based weights significantly improves the prediction performance of all the methods.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the data model and notations we use, and briefly provides a background on link prediction tasks studied in the literature. Next, Section 3 outlines various time-agnostic, state-of-the-art link prediction methods. Section 4 which forms a key contribution of this paper, describes in detail how to incorporate temporal features of an evolving social network for link prediction. We introduce our novel evaluation methodology in Section 5 and experimental results in Section 6. Finally, we briefly sketch the related work in Section 7 before concluding in Section 8.</p><p>edges irrespective of the vertices they connect. This may lead to situations where the top of the list of edges is occupied by mutually uninteresting pairs of vertices. In our opinion, users are typically interested in the growth of the network around a selected vertex.</p><p>Given v, a user wants to know which vertices are most likely to be connected with v in the future. This is related to tasks of discovering new and old friends in social networks, e.g. the People You May Know tool on the social networking website Facebook.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">BACKGROUND 2.1 Data Model and Notations</head><p>Social network data can be naturally represented as a hypergraph H = (V, E). Nodes represent users (authors) and hyperedges represent social interaction between them (co-authorship of a paper). The hypergraph H can be transformed into a simple graph G = (V, E ), where two nodes are connected iff there exists a hyperedge e ¡Ê E connecting them. Although the simple graph representation of a network contains less information than a hypergraph, link prediction methods over the simple graph can benefit from reduced noise in the data. In the rest of the paper, we use author and node interchangeably since we deal only with bibliographic networks in this work.</p><p>Edge-centric link prediction often boils down to deciding whether two nodes have anything in common -irrespective of the distance between them in the social network. However, in reality, most links are established between nodes that are close in terms of the graph distance between them and similarity of attributes. These facts are known as the locality of edge attachment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and homophily <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. When the link prediction is treated as a binary classification, the following problem occurs in the selection of training and testing data points. The negative points are random pairs of vertices. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that they have any co-authors in common, that they work in the same field, or even that they are connected by some path. It would make more sense to choose pairs of vertices that are close to each other, but did not collaborate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Tasks in Link Prediction</head><p>O'Madadhain et al. pointed out <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> that social networks can represent two kinds of data: (i) persistent relations, e.g. friendships between two people and (ii) discrete events, e.g. co-authorship of scientific papers. In the first situation the network is modeled by a simple graph and new edges are created between vertices that are at distance two or higher. In the second situation, however, edges may appear not only between vertices at distance two or higher but also between vertices that are already connected (repeated edges). As we show later, the number of repeated edges in co-authorship networks can be as high as 50%. We can reasonably expect similar, if not larger, fraction of repeated edges in other networks corresponding to discrete events, such as telephone call networks or e-mail networks.</p><p>In order to avoid this problem, we propose to utilize a node-centric approach. Given a node v we calculate its neighborhood N (v) and output a list of vertices w ¡Ê N (v) according to the propensity that they will collaborate with v. The neighborhood N (v) does not be a neighborhood as defined in graph theory, i.e. elements of N (v) need not be linked with v. It makes sense, however, to build the neighborhood based on graph-theoretic measures. For instance, we can define N (v) as the direct and the distance-2 neighbors of v. This is a more natural view of the link prediction problem than the edge-centric approach. Moreover, we consider only pairs of vertices that are close to each other. Since some of the nodes collaborated with the central node recently and others a long time ago, link prediction methods benefit from time-awareness in the nodecentric scenario. This is not the case in the edge-centric approach, which focuses on deciding whether nodes are related in any way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">TIME-AGNOSTIC LINK PREDICTION</head><p>The above observations suggest that there are two main problems in link prediction: (i) prediction of new links, which we also call as prediction at distance 1, (ii) prediction of both new and repeated links, which we call prediction at distances 2 and higher. Current link prediction methods are mostly tested in the first scenario. Surprisingly, little effort was made to solve the second problem. Although one can expect that methods of predicting new links also work in the case of repeated links, we found that exploiting temporal information can be particularly beneficial for repeated link prediction.</p><p>We start the presentation of link prediction methods with a brief description of time-agnostic methods that we will extend to be timeaware. All link prediction methods that we consider are functions f : V ¡Á V ¡ú R, where one of the arguments is the central node.</p><p>The value of the function is used to rank the nodes from the neighborhood of the central node.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Baseline Methods</head><p>The baseline methods we use are described in detail by LibenNowell and Kleinberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Let ¦£(x) denote neighbors of the node x, we define the following measures</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">|¦£(x) ¡É ¦£(y)| common neighbors (1) |¦£(x) ¡É ¦£(y)| |¦£(x) ¡È ¦£(y)| Jaccard's coefficient (2)</formula><p>2.3 Edge-centric vs. Node-centric Prediction</p><p>The link prediction problem we stated earlier, requires as input two nodes v and u between which the probability of an edge is estimated. We term this as an edge-centric approach to link prediction. To the best of our knowledge, all publications about link prediction follow the edge-centric approach: the link prediction problem is stated as a ranking of vertex pairs. The edge-centric approach has its disadvantages. It assumes that users are interested in new A robust measure similar to common neighbors was proposed by Adamic and Adar <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Closeness between nodes x and y is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">AA (x, y) := 1 log |¦£ (z)| (3) z¡Ê¦£(x)¡É¦£(y)</formula><p>The intuition behind this method is simple. It measures the number of common neighbors of x and y. Each neighbor z is weighted according to its importance for the connection. If a node has many neighbors, the fact that it connects x and y is not very meaningful. On the contrary, if it has only a few neighbors, then it is important for the connection.</p><p>represented by the marginal P (u, v) = 1/20. The constraint can be also written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x¡ÊS P (x)k(x) = 1 20</formula><p>The rooted PageRank measure is more subtle and achieves good results. It is the stationary probability that a random walk from x visits node y. To minimize the influence of distant parts of the graph on the value of the predictor, the walk jumps to the starting node with probability ¦Á. For efficiency reasons we calculate PageRank only on the neighborhood of the central node.</p><p>where k is an indicator function</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">k(x) = 1 if {u, v} ? x 0 otherwise</formula><p>Finally, the problem of finding the maximum entropy distribution can be stated as</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Time-agnostic Maximum Entropy</head><p>In this section, we will present details of local probabilistic model for link prediction proposed by Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Since the method is based on the maximum entropy principle we will refer to it as the time-agnostic maximum entropy method. Let us consider an example:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">min P D(P Q)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>s.t.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P (x)k(x|j) = d(j) for j = 0, . . . , m x¡ÊS V = {a, b, c, d, e, f } N = {a, b, c, d}</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Lagrange Multipliers for Time Agnostic Problem</head><p>If a and d wrote a paper together, then the corresponding event x would be 0, 0, 1 If the paper was written by a, d and e, the string would be the same since e / ¡Ê N . The empty set -0, 0, 0 -denotes any paper written by authors who are not in N . Usually |N | is much less than |V |, hence we expect that P (?) will be close to 1.</p><p>Lagrange multipliers is a method of optimizing a function subject to some constraints. For a detailed description of the method we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Applied to the problem formulated in (5) it results in:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L(P, ¦Ë) = x¡ÊS P (x) log P (x) Q(x)</formula><p>Let u and v be authors, the probability that they collaborate is a marginal of P :</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">m + ¦Ëj P (x)k(x|j) ? d(j) (6) j=0 x¡ÊS P (u, v) = P (x).<label>(4)</label></formula><p>{x¡ÊS|{u,v}?x}</p><p>We want to obtain the dual function</p><p>Our main task is to estimate the joint probability distribution. The hypergraph describing the co-authorship network contains events (papers) that we observed. Compared to the number of possible events (2 k ), our data set is very sparse. Therefore, P must be estimated carefully -we want the estimator of P to be "smooth". This goal can be achieved by using the maximum entropy principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The principle says that we should choose the distribution which: (i) agrees with the observations we have about P , (ii) does not make any additional assumptions. No additional assumptions means that P should be as close as possible to a prior distribution Q. The distance is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">g(¦Ë) = inf P L(P, ¦Ë)<label>(7)</label></formula><p>We do this by minimizing over P by setting the appropriate derivatives to 0:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">?L ?P (x) = log P (x) Q(x) + 1 + m ¦Ëjk(x|j) ! = 0 j=0 we obtain m P (x) = Q(x) exp ?1 ? ¦Ëjk(x|j) (8) j=0 D(P Q) = x P (x) log P (x) Q(x)</formula><p>In the special case of Q = U (uniform distribution), minimizing the divergence is equivalent to maximizing entropy of distribution P , hence the name of the method -maximum entropy estimation.</p><p>In our setting, we use a prior different from the uniform as follows: Let P (ai) be the probability that author ai writes a paper. Then the prior probability of a paper is This can be substituted into (7). In order to make the formulas "match" the time aware version that follows, we denote ¦Ë0 by ¦Í:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">m m g (¦Ë, ¦Í) = Q (x) exp ?1 ? ¦Ëjk (x|j) ? ¦Í + ¦Ëjdj+¦Í x j=1 j=1 Q ((a1, a2, . . . , an)) = P (ai) ¡¤ (1 ? P (ai)) i:a i =1 i:a i =0</formula><p>This prior is equivalent to assumption that an author of a paper occurs independently of other authors.</p><p>(9) Under the strong duality the solution to the dual problem gives us also the solution to the primal problem. Therefore, we need to solve just the dual. In the time aware version of maximum entropy, described below, we require the solution of time agnostic problem. We refer the value of ¦Ë which optimizes (9) as l.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">TIME-AWARE LINK PREDICTION</head><p>What does P agrees with observations mean? Suppose that our set of observations contains 200 elements (papers) and exactly 10 of them are co-authored by u, v and perhaps by some additional authors. We impose a constraint on the joint distribution. It is This section presents our time-aware link prediction methods. We we start we a presentation of extensions to baseline methods, in the order of maximum distance they can handle. Then, we move to the time-aware maximum entropy.  The first task that we consider is repeated link prediction. Suppose, we want to predict the next repeated collaboration of node v. We treat the problem as a ranking of nodes from N (v) = {w | w = v ¡Ä distance(v, w) = 1}. The ranking of node w is based solely on the properties of the edge w In the co-authorship network there are three properties that can be used for this purpose:</p></div>

In the simplest case the probability of following a link of the current node is uniform. We can introduce time-awareness, as well as other extensions, by following a link with probability proportional to its weight. Let us denote the weight of an edge by w(¡¤, ¡¤). If x and y are neighbors, then the probability of the walk going from x to y is Publications record author's interests and social connections. Both can change over time. Scientists find new research areas exciting and move between universities. Clearly, older publications are less relevant to link prediction than more recent ones. Our time-aware method works by allowing to forget old events, thus minimizing noise which they may introduce.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">P [x ¡ú y] = (1?¦Á) w(x, y) z¡Ê¦£(x) w(x, z) + ¦Á if y is the central node 0 otherwise .</formula><p>The events are forgotten when the constraints that they impose on P can be violated. In our version of maximum entropy the violations are penalized with weights wj and a penalty term is added to the objective function. Changing the weights enables us to smoothly interpolate between the solution of standard maximum entropy (?jwj = ¡Þ) and the prior distribution (?jwj = 0). Additionally, we can trade violation of one constraint for violation of another. The penalized maximum entropy is 3. Constraints are scaled according to the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">wj ¡û lj wj max k w k m</formula><p>where vector l is the solution of the dual, time-agnostic problem.</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">min P D(P Q) + wj¦Âj (12) j=1 s.t.

If t denotes the time of publication normalized in such way that the beginning of the data set corresponds to 0.0 and the end to 1.0, then the weighting functions are scaled and shifted variants of exp(3t), t and (t).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG)</head><p>The first method of evaluating a ranking of nodes is based on the standard discounted cumulative gain (DCG) used in information retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. It is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">k DCG(r) = r(i) log 2 (i + 1) . i=1</formula><p>2. Weight of a constraint is the average or the sum of weights of the papers which contribute to the constraint.

The expected DCG of a random ranking is some non-zero value, which also depends on the number of 1's and the length of the ranking.

In the best possible ranking all 1's occur before the 0's, the DCG of such ranking will be denoted by DCG best (r), conversely the worst DCG will be denoted by DCGworst(r) and it is the score of a ranking where all 0's occur before the 1's. We normalized DCG and the expected DCG, so they fall into [0, 1] interval:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">DCG01(r) := DCG(r) ? DCGworst(r) DCG best (r) ? DCGworst(r) EDCG01(r) := E[DCG(r)] ?

Therefore it is possible to compare the performance of our methods with the prior works. Both the datasets contain publications spanning more than a decade. Unfortunately, the density of publications recorded over time is not consistent -with earlier years sparsely represented. We eliminated these early years, and used information of publications from the past 10 years. Note that, this data-cleaning is consistent with other work that have used the same sources of collaboration networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. We further clean the dataset by eliminating publications written by only one author since they do not help in link prediction framework in anyway. The publication data from the first 8 years are used to build subgraphs on which the methods are tested. The remaining 2 years yield the ground truth, against which we compute the prediction accuracy using DCG and ANR measures we introduced earlier.</p><p>The construction of the score makes the expected score of a random ranking equal 1. The upper bound depends on the length and number of 1's in the ranking, therefore it must be reported alongside with the score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Average Normalized Rank (ANR)</head><p>We introduce the second measure which tells us directly where the relevant items are placed in the ranking. The measure weighs all positions equally, and therefore it is useful if we are also interested in the item placed behind the beginning of a ranking. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes various features of the data sets we have used. The number of collaborations is the number of pairs of authors who collaborated at least once, and it is equal to the number of edges in a simple graph of collaborations. We can see from the table, that the papers in DBLP data set have less authors, the average is 3.08 authors per paper compared with 4.72 for the astro-ph. Authors in DBLP have less papers than those from the astro-ph data set. Based on these observations we expect that distance-k neighborhoods in DBLP are less than in astro-ph. If the compared ranking contains only one item labeled 1 at a position i, the measure shows the fraction of the ranked items we need to skip to reach i, i.e. (i ? 1)/k. If more such items exist we take the average of their scores:</p></div>

An ideal ranking will obtain a score close to 0, worst possible ranking will obtain a score close to 1. Our testing method ranks the neighborhood of a node v. We aim to choose the neighborhood which captures most of the collaboration of v. The results presented above show that such neighborhood can consist of direct neighbors of v and possibly also nodes which are at the distance 2 from v. Taking into account more neighbors does not improve the recall of collaborations much, but it significantly increases the size of the neighborhood.    ? for prediction of new links only, these neighborhoods consist of nodes at distances 2 and higher; ? for the task of repeated link prediction, the neighborhoods contain only the nodes at distance 1 from the central nodes. </p><formula xml:id="formula_29">C(v) = number</formula></div>

Hence, if two nodes are connected by a node with a low degree, they are likely to be connected too. This does not hold if the intermediate node has high degree. The observation justifies the effectiveness of Adamic-Adar measure in link prediction.</p><p>We used maximum entropy methods to predict repeated link occurrences, i.e. neighborhoods contained only direct neighbors of central nodes. Additionally, we require that central nodes fulfill 4 ¡Ü |¦£(v)| ¡Ü 8. The lower bound removes uninteresting cases. The upper bound is necessary for efficient calculations of maximum entropy methods. The maximum entropy methods model the probability of papers to occur. If a neighborhood has size n, then there are 2 n possible papers. Thus, maximum entropy has exponential complexity and this limits the size of the neighborhood that can be processed. We empirically found that the maximum entropy methods work fast enough when there are at most 8 nodes in the neighborhood plus the central node. <ref type="bibr">Wang et al. [19]</ref> built maximum entropy models on neighborhoods of size 8, which is 1 less than in our experiments (8 neighbors + 1 central node). The problem with the complexity of maximum entropy methods was not evident in the edge-centric settings, where the subgraph connecting two nodes can be quite small. However, in the node-centric approach it means that we have to prune the neighborhood of the central node. We follow the simplest possible pruning algorithm: if a central node has more than 8 neighbors, we chose at random 8 of them. Moreover, we prune away neighbors that do not meet a minimum support threshold of having at least 5 papers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2">Distance Between Collaborating Pairs</head><p>We observed that a large fraction of collaborations happen between authors who are close in the collaboration graph. For example, in DBLP, 50% of collaborations occur between authors who have already co-authored a paper in the past. Additional 12% of collaborations occur between authors who have at least one co-author in common. The distribution of distances between collaborating nodes is presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 3</ref>. The fact that most links are created between nodes that are close in the graph was also observed by Leskovec et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Furthermore, they show that the number of nodes at distance h from given node grows exponentially. Hence, as the distance between two (disconnected) nodes increases, it gets harder to predict their linkage in the future.</p><p>For other link prediction methods, we test using the following types of neighborhoods: (i) direct neighborhoods, (ii) neighborhoods expanding to distance 2, (iii) neighborhoods expanding to distance 3.

No thresholds on the number of papers are applied. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> contains results of our experiments with time-aware and time-agnostic maximum entropy methods.

On the other hand, ANR weights all positions equally, thus it is sensitive to quality of ranking for higher distances. The effect can be observed when we compare PageRank and "last, count" for astro-ph with distances up to 3. Even though DCG scores are similar, ANR scores show that PageRank is preferred. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Results of experiments with repeated link prediction.

The improvement is significant and happens consistently for all methods extended with temporal information, on both data sets. The results are confirmed by both DCG and ANR metrics. The improvement of DCG, means that temporal information positively influences the quality of the top of rankings, which is important in applications where the results are presented to a human user. The simplest method -"last, count", which sorts the nodes by the time of the most recent collaboration with the central node and the number of collaborations, shows slightly better performance than the time-aware maxent. It also outperforms the other presented methods. We observe that varying the choice of a function which assigns weights to papers does not influence the performance of maxent much. However, the way the weights of papers are transformed into weights of constraint does. "sum" which captures both temporal information and frequency of events, yields weaker results in comparison with "avg." which captures only time of publication of papers.</p><p>The results show that link prediction methods can be improved by taking time into account. For repeated link prediction methods that consider only temporal information can easily outperform methods based on the network structure. Results for new link prediction <ref type="table">(Table 4)</ref> show that we are far from the best possible score. This should be expected, because link prediction is a difficult task. The difficulty is also visible in results from other authors, for example Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RE-SEARCH</head><p>In this work, we presented methods to incorporate temporal information available on evolving social networks for link prediction tasks. We showed that time of interactions between entities is a dominant feature for ranking neighboring nodes based on their probability of future interaction with the central node. This observation holds beyond the immediate direct neighborhood of the chosen node. A very simple time-aware method of (last,count)-based ranking is shown to outperform more other, more sophisticated, techniques in repeated link prediction. The performance of simple baseline predictors is improved by time-based weighting of edges. We also shown, that the performance of predictors is improved by weighting edges according to the connection strength between the authors.</p><p>An important contribution of our work is a novel node-centric approach to the evaluation of link prediction. Our node-centric testing consist in ranking a set nodes close to a central node v according to the probability that they will collaborate with v. It resembles usage of real world link prediction systems, such as the People You May Know tool on Facebook.</p><p>In the future we would like to test our link prediction methods on data sets other than scientific collaboration networks. We also would like to further investigate combining features for ranking nodes. Finally, we would like to look closer at the problem of disambiguating entities in the network. Both entity disambiguation and link prediction can use structure of the network. Therefore, there is a possibility of applying observations or methods from one field to the other.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>H. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>8 [Database Applications]: Data Mining; G.2.2 [Graph The- ory]: Network Problems Keywords Social Networks, Evolution, Link Analysis, Link Prediction</figDesc></figure>
