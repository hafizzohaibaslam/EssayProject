				<p>We introduce a game-theoretic model of diffusion of technologies, advertisements, or influence through a social network. The novelty in our model is that the players are interested parties outside the network. We study the relation between the diameter of the network and the existence of pure Nash equilibria in the game. In particular, we show that if the diameter is at most two then an equilibrium exists and can be found in polynomial time, whereas if the diameter is greater than two then an equilibrium is not guaranteed to exist.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter are modern focal points of human interaction. The pursuit of insights into the nature of this interaction calls for a game-theoretic analysis. Indeed, a number of papers (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>) investigate variations on the following setting. The social network is represented by an undirected graph, where the vertices are users and edges connect users who are in a social relationship. Suppose, for example, that there are several competing applications, e.g., voice over IP systems, that are not interoperable. The users play a coordination game, where if two neighbors adopt the same system they get some reward that is based on the inher-ent quality of the system. The goal is to study the diffusion of technologies through the social network. The point of view here is completely decentralized, and the players in the game are the users of the social network.</p><p>We propose a different, global point of view regarding the incentives that govern the diffusion process. Suppose we have several firms that would like to advertise competing products via "viral marketing". Each firm initially targets a small subset of users, in the hope that the rumor about its product would spread throughout the network. However, a user that adopts one product is reluctant to adopt another, hence the campaign of one firm negatively affects the success of another firm's campaign. To the best of our knowledge our model is the first game-theoretic model to deal with the incentives of interested parties outside the social network. Note that some previous papers did consider the problem of choosing an influential set of users as an optimization problem (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>), but not in a competitive game-theoretic setting. Other papers, which deal with Voronoi games on graphs, provide a game-theoretic study of a static facility location problem where each vertex is assigned to the closest agent and the utility of an agent is the number of vertices assigned to it (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>). In our model, in contrast, vertices are <ref type="bibr">0020</ref> where x i （ V is the initial vertex selected by agent i. We also denote</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x ?i = =x 1 , . . . , x i?1 , x i+1 , . . . , x n .</formula><p>Given a strategy profile x （ V n , the utility of agent i （ N, denoted U i (x), is the number of nodes that are colored in color i when the diffusion process terminates. For instance, in the example given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>  </p></div>

Indeed, if we can find a Nash equilibrium then we can often predict the behavior of the agents and the outcome of this competitive diffusion process, or, alternatively, advise the agents how to play. Our first theorem is the following.  a Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, an equilibrium can be found in polynomial time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">The model</head><p>details about the diameter of random graphs).

The diffusion process unfolds as follows. There are n + 2 colors: a color for each agent i （ N, as well as two additional colors: white and gray. Initially, at time 1, some of the vertices are colored in the colors of N, while the others are white. At time t + 1 each white vertex that has neighbors colored in color i, but does not have neighbors colored in color j for any j （ N \ {i}, is colored in color i. diameter at most two. Finally, social networks typically have a very small diameter. Therefore, it can be argued that assuming a diameter of two is not very restrictive.</p><p>It is now natural to ask whether the existence of Nash equilibria can also be guaranteed for diameters larger than two. It is not too difficult to construct a graph with diameter four that does not admit an equilibrium. Our second theorem gives a negative answer even with respect to diameter three.</p><p>A white vertex that has two neighbors colored by two distinct colors i, j （ N is colored gray. In other words, we assume that if two agents compete for a user at the same time they "cancel out" and the user is removed from the game. The process continues until it reaches a fixed point, that is, all the remaining white vertices are unreachable due to gray vertices. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> for an illustration of the diffusion process. The construction in the proof of Theorem 2.2 can easily be extended to a larger number of agents or to any (finite or infinite) diameter greater than three.</p><p>A game Γ = =G, N is induced by a graph G, representing the underlying social network, and the set of agents N.

A strategy profile is a vector x = =x 1 , . . . , x n （ V n , Richer (probabilistic) models of diffusion through a social network exist in the literature, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. On the other hand, the assumption of discrete time steps is quite common.</p><p>Theorem 2.1 implies that with high probability a random graph (even a relatively sparse one) induces a game that admits a Nash equilibrium. However, social networks are normally not completely random, but rather often exhibit structure. Ideally one would be able to extend our result by showing that under a convincing random graph model of social networks (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>) the induced game admits a Nash equilibrium with high probability.</p><p>where χ A i is the indicator function that returns 1 if x （ A i and 0 otherwise.
