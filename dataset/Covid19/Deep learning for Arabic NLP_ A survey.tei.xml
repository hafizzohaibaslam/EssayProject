			<abstract>
				<p>The recent advances in deep learning (DL) have caused breakthroughs in many fields such as computer vision, natural language processing (NLP) and speech processing. Many DL based approaches have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results on various tasks that are of great importance to online social networks (OSN) and social computing such as sentiment analysis (SA) and pharmacovigilance. NLP tasks are becoming very prominent in OSN and DL is offering researchers and practitioners exciting new directions to address these tasks. In this paper, we provide a survey of the published papers on using DL techniques for NLP. We focus on the Arabic language due to its importance, the scarcity of resources on it and the challenges associated with working on it. We notice that DL has yet to receive the attention it deserves from the Arabic NLP (ANLP) community compared with the attention it is getting for other languages despite the vast adoption of social networks in the Arab world. The majority of the early works on using DL for ANLP focused on OCR-related problems while the more recent ones are more diverse with the increasing interest in applying DL to SA, machine translation, diacritization, etc. This survey should serve as a guide for the young and growing ANLP community in order to help bridge the huge gap between ANLP literature and the much richer and more mature English NLP literature.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Over the past few decades, the amount of user generated content has grown rapidly. This is mainly due to the prevalence of online social networks (OSN). Such surge of available raw data contributed to the rise of many new interesting fields such as social network analysis and big data in addition to increasing the interest in existing fields such as artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP).</p><p>Social media analytics is closely related to NLP. The use of NLP techniques for processing the contents of OSN have gained a lot of attention from the academic world as well as from the industry. In fact, this myriad research and commercial interests have lead to/helped in the creation of entire events dedicated to this topic, such as Social NLP, 1 in addition to the emergence of a large number of businesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>NLP techniques can help in addressing many interesting problems in OSN such as geolocation identification, public opinion mining, sentiment/emotion analysis, trend analysis, event extrac-tion, controversy detection, crowd monitoring, public health monitoring, disaster management, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, the NLP community has witnessed many breakthroughs due to the use of deep learning. Deep learning (DL), a subfield of machine learning (ML), depends on a set of algorithms in order to learn multiple levels of representation with the aim of finding a model for high level abstractions in data. DL tries to mimic the human brain, by constructing an architecture that consists of an input layer and an output layer with many hidden layers (encoders) between them. These hidden layers are responsible for doing complex computations in order to extract features from the raw data in order to obtain a better representation. On the other side, there is the shallow learning, which is a type of learning that consists of at most of three levels, and it is widely used with linear problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Many techniques are used with DL, such as deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), long shortterm memory (LSTM), recurrent neural networks (RNN), etc., with several success stories across different domains.</p><p>In this paper, we survey the published works on applying DL techniques on NLP problems. We focus on the Arabic language due to its importance, the large number of Arabic speakers in OSN, the scarcity of resources on it and the challenges associated with working on it. This survey should serve as a guide for the young and growing Arabic NLP (ANLP) community in order to help bridge the gap between ANLP literature and the much richer and more mature English NLP literature.</p><p>The Arabic language is of undeniable importance. Not only it is being used by hundreds of millions of people, it has a quickly increasing online presence (in terms of the users and content). Moreover, Arabic has many unique characteristics that makes the automated handling and understanding of Arabic text challenging and interesting. Giving an overview of the Arabic language and a survey of the young field of Arabic NLP is beyond the scope of this paper. Interested readers are referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> for such coverage.</p><p>Among the many characteristics of the Arabic language, there are some characteristics that have significant effect on the general approaches to handle the different NLP problems. Examples include the language's complex nature (derivational, inflectional, etc.). Another example is the existence of many variations of the language such as the Classical Arabic (CA) (which is mainly used in ancient and theological texts but is still understood due to its use in the Holy Quran), the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) (which is a modernized and simplified version of CA) and Dialectal/colloquial Arabic (DA) (where each region has its own dialect). The most widely-understood variation among Arabic speakers is MSA due to its wide adoption in education, media, and formal communication across the different Arabic speaking countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</p><p>In the rest of this paper, we discuss the papers using DL for ANLP tasks. The coverage is based on the addressed problems. We start with the most common application of DL for ANLP, which is for optical character recognition (OCR) problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Optical character recognition (OCR)</head><p>In this section, we discuss the works employing DL techniques for optical character recognition (OCR) problems in ANLP. We exclude the efforts focusing only on digit recognition including the very popular and highly cited MNIST dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> as well as other similar datasets such as the CMATERdb 3.3.1 dataset. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> It is worth mentioning that Arabic scripts differ greatly from other languages and, thus, approaches that work well for Latin or Chinese scripts may fail horribly when applied to Arabic script. Reasons behind this include the use of cursive right-to-left style of writing, the fact that the shape of a character depends on its position within the word, the similarity between different characters (as they sometimes differ only by the number or positions of dots), etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</p><p>As can be inferred from the size of this subsection, DL adoption for OCR of Arabic script has been the most popular among ANLP subfields, however, there is still a lot of room for improvement on OCR problems already addressed by DL. Moreover, there are other OCRrelated problems that have yet to be addressed using DL approaches such as write identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Handwritten text</head><p>We start our discussion with the one of the most frequently addressed OCR problems, which handwritten Arabic text recognition. In one of earliest works, Al-Jawfi <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> introduced an approach for Arabic handwritten text recognition problem. Based on the work of LeCun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, Al-Jawfi's approach used LeNet, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN). The approach involves two phases: one for recognizing the body of the characters and one for recognizing the dots. It takes as input a set of 16 ¡Á 16 normalized images. They go through two hidden layers and the backpropagation algorithm was used to update the weights in the network. The experiments on this network was carried out using a dataset of 758 segmented images of Arabic characters (550 for training and 208 for testing) handwritten by different people. On average, the mean square error (MSE) for the training set was 0.087 and, for the testing set, it was 0.42. The results are not very encouraging and the author do not compare them with the state-of-the-art results on the same dataset.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, the authors proposed to combine multidimensional RNN (MDRNN) and connectionist temporal classification (CTC) to design an alphabet-independent offline handwriting recognition system that takes raw pixel data as input. Specifically, they propose to repeatedly compose multidimensional LSTM (MDLSTM) layers with feed-forward layers. They tested their network on the IFN/ENIT dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, which consists of 32,492 images of Tunisian town names. They used 30,000 images for training and the remaining 2492 images for testing. The reported error rate was 8.57%, which was better than the state-of-the-art at that time.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the authors compared MDLSTM learned features <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> with four state-of-the-art handcrafted feature sets. For recognition, each set of features was fed into bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM)-CTC network. For MDLSTM, the authors used the same network as the one used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> where the RNNLIB implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> was used. The experiments were carried out using the IFN/ENIT dataset. The results showed that MDLSTM learned features produced the least recognition rates (RR) among all tested feature sets. However, the results also showed that merging the MDLSTM learned features with each one of the four handcrafted feature sets (through plurality voting) lead to improved RR. Finally, merging all five sets of features did not provide significantly better RR.</p><p>Building on <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the same authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposed a framework for evaluating feature sets for offline handwriting recognition. They proposed to train a RNN classifier on each feature and use a weighted vote combination of these classifiers. The goal is to measure the strengths and complementarity of different feature sets. They use their system to evaluate several feature sets (including handcrafted and automatically learned (using MDLSTM networks) feature sets) using an Arabic dataset (IFN/ENIT) and a Latine one (RIMES <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>).</p><p>Another work on Arabic handwritten text recognition problem is that of Porwal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, where the authors used deep belief networks (DBN) with one input layer and three hidden layers. The training process had two phases. The first phase is the pre-training phase, which was done using restricted Boltzman machine (RBM). The output of each hidden layer was used as input parameters for the above hidden layer. The second phase was fine tuning, and DBN was used with features based approach. For the experiments, the authors used the applied media analysis (AMA) Arabic Handwritten dataset of parts of Arabic words (PAW) classes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> The dataset had 6464 training samples and 848 testing samples distributed among 34 classes. They compared their approach with those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> and the results showed that using the proposed DBN approach on the raw images did not yield better results compared to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. However, combining the DBN approach with the handcrafted features of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> gave the best accuracy of 89.4%.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the authors discussed combining probabilistic graphical models (PGM) classifiers for Arabic handwritten words recognition. The considered classifiers include hidden Markov models (HMM) and DBN. They experimented with the IFN/ENIT dataset to show the feasibility of the proposed approach.</p><p>A large number of papers were published over the past few years by a group of researchers at the University of Gabes and Sfax University, Tunisia, on utilizing different DL networks such as DBN, DNN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, etc., for Arabic handwritten text recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Elleuch et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> applied DBN on raw images of Arabic scripts. Specifically, they experimented with two datasets: the HACDB dataset for offline Arabic character recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and the ADAB dataset for online Arabic word recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>. The HACDB dataset contained 6600 images, each normalized 28 ¡Á 28 pixels in gray scale. The images represent 66 classes: 58 classes representing the unique ways to write single Arabic characters and 8 classes representing the unique ways to write pairs of Arabic characters. The training part of the dataset contains 5280 images while the testing part contained the remaining 1320 images. For this dataset, experiments showed that the best performance reached a good error rate of 2.1% and it was achieved with two hidden layers, each with 1000 units. According to the authors, this accuracy is comparable to what is reported in the literature. As for the ADAB dataset, it contained 946 different labels representing Tunisian towns names. It has a total of 33,164 sub-words and 174,690 characters written by 166 persons. For this dataset, experiments showed that the best performance reached a very poor error rate of 41% and it was achieved with two hidden layers, each with 400 units. The results for this dataset is way below what is reported in the literature.</p><p>In an extension of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> proposed to combine the DBN of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> with bottleneck features (BNF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41]</ref>. They tested their approach on the LMCA dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> padded with some manually segmented characters and ligatures extracted from the ADAB dataset. The best error rate was 3.84%.</p><p>In another extension of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> proposed to use a convolutional DBN (CDBN) combined with support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, they considered two problems: character recognition, for which they used the HACDB dataset, and word recognition, for which they used the IFN/ENIT dataset. For the HACDB dataset, they showed that the proposed CDBN/SVM approach was better than the DBN approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> with an error rate of 1.82% (compared with 2.1% error rate reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>). As for the IFN/ENIT dataset, which consists of 26,459 words handwritten by more than 411 different persons representing 946 Tunisian town/village names, the reported error rate was 16.3%.</p><p>Another work by the same authors on CDBN is <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> in which the authors proposed to add offline hand-crafted features extracted using the BetaElliptical method. They tested their approach on the ADAB and the LMCA dataset. The latter dataset contains images of digits, characters and words. However, the authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> only used the 100,000 images of 56 characters (with 70% used for training and 30% for testing). The reported error rates are 8.2% and 2.49% for the ADAB and LMCA datasets, receptively.</p><p>In another work <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> published in the same year as <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, the authors compared DBN with CNN on the HACDB dataset. For DBN, they used the same architecture as <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, but reported higher error rate of 3.64% compared with <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. As for CNN, the authors used two layers for convolution, each followed by a layer for sub-sampling to reduce dimensionality. Then, they had a fully connected layer for classification. The reported error rate for CNN was 14.71%.</p><p>In another extension of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> experimented with using the dropout <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> and dropconnect <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref> regularization methods to address the overfitting problem of DBN. They reported error rates of 2.73% and 2.27% when using dropout and dropconnect, respectively, which are better than the error rate of 3.64% reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> when No-Drop was used. However, these results are still worse than the error rates reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</p><p>Building up on <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, the same authors proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> to integrate CNN and SVM classifiers (while employing the dropout technique in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>). The idea is to use SVM to alter the trainable classifier of the CNN and it was inspired by the work of Niu and Suen <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref> on handwritten digit recognition. The CNN part is similar to the one proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, except that dropout is applied to the fully connected before feeding the output into an SVM classifier. They experimented on the HACDB and IFN/ENIT datasets. For the HACDB dataset, they reported error rates of 6.59% in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and 5.83% in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, which are lower than the 14.71% error rate achieved by simple CNN in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. As for the IFN/ENIT dataset, which was only used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, the reported error rate was 7.05%.</p><p>Other works that tried to integrate SVM with DL was <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, in which the same authors employed the idea of <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> to mimic DBN architecture in order to build a Deep SVM (DSVM) classifier by simply stacking several multi-class SVM classifiers (with radial basis function (RBF) kernels). They experimented with the HACDB dataset and reported error rates of 8.64% in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and 5.68% in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>In another direction by the same group of researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> considered using deep bidirectional LSTM (DBLSTM) networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>, which is a special type of RNN. They trained it with CTC and used dropout to avoid overfitting. Using the RNNLIB library of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the authors built a network of 14 layers. Three of these layers are fully connected and hidden and they are composed of 20, 60 and 180 LSTM units. For the output layer, they used a softmax output layer of 46 units. They tested their network on the ADAB dataset and reported 26.28% error rate.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, the authors built on the MDLSTM network of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. They used 28 layers. Three of these layers are fully connected and hidden and they are composed of 2, 10 and 50 LSTM units. For the output layer, they used a softmax output layer of 121 units. The main contribution in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> was to address the overfitting problem. To do so, the authors used the dropout technique. However, they only applied it on the feed-forward connections before the sub-sample layers which are not fully connected. They tested their approach on the IFN/ENIT dataset to show its effectiveness compared with the original approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. The error rate of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>'s approach is 12.09% whereas the error of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>'s is 16.97%. In an extension of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> further studied applying the dropout technique in different places. Instead of only applying dropout after MDLSTM (as was done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>), they experiment with applying it before or inside MDLSTM. The results on the IFN/ENIT dataset showed reduced error rates of 11.62% and 11.88% for these two cases, respectively.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>, the authors described the systems they submitted to the Arabic handwriting recognition competition OpenHaRT 2013 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>. These systems were based on an optical model using LSTM network trained to recognize the different forms of the Arabic characters directly from the image, without explicit feature extraction nor segmentation. Large vocabulary selection techniques and ngram language modeling were used to provide a full paragraph recognition, without explicit word segmentation. Several recognition systems were also combined with the ROVER combination algorithm. The best system exceeded 80% of recognition rate.</p><p>Later, the same group showed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref> how to improve the performance of RNN with LSTM cells on unconstrained handwriting recognition using dropout. They show how to carefully use dropout in the network so that it does not affect the recurrent connections, hence the power of RNNs in modeling sequences is preserved. The authors perform extensive experiments to confirm the effectiveness of dropout on deep architectures even when the network mainly consists of recurrent and shared connections. Among the datasets under consideration is the OpenHaRT 2013 dataset.</p><p>The unsupervised and transfer learning challenge (UTL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref> consisted of five datasets from various domains including one with Arabic handwritten ancient manuscripts called AVICENNA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref> discuss their DL approach for the UTL challenge datasets. Their approach combined and stacked different one-layer unsupervised learning algorithms, adapted to each one of the five datasets. For the AVICENNA dataset, they applied whitened principle component analysis (PCA) on the raw data. In the second layer, they used denoising auto encoder (DeAE) consisting of 600 hidden units. The last layer simply contained a transductive PCA.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>, the authors proposed a CNN network based on fast wavelet transform (FWT) and Adaboost algorithm for Arabic handwritten character recognition. Based on multi-resolution analysis (MRA) at different levels of abstraction, FWT is used to extract character's features. The authors evaluated their approach on the IESK-arDB dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> which includes 6000 images, and the obtained accuracy was 93.92%.</p><p>Recently, El-Sawy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref> discussed the use of CNN for recognizing Arabic handwritten characters. They used their won dataset consisting of 16,800 images and reported an error rate of 5.1%.</p></div>

In <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref>, the authors proposed to use a CNN inspired by a prior work of the same authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[63]</ref>. They showed the superiority of the CNN approach compared with two approaches relying on multiexit asymmetric boosting cascade. The developed CNN consists of six layers with the first four layers being used for features extraction and the remaining two layers being used for classification. The authors used an in-house dataset collected from Arabic TV channels. The training set consisted of 30,000 text images and each method used bootstrapping to obtain negative examples. The dataset had two test sets: one has 201 images with 959 annotated text areas while the other has 164 images with 1017 annotated text areas. For the first test set, the CNN approach gave better Fmeasure and lower computation time compared with the other two approaches. However, its detection rate (DR) was lower. As for the second test set, CNN results were better in terms of F-measure and DR.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60]</ref>, the authors discussed their effort to build the ALIF dataset 7 for detecting Arabic text in TV broadcasts. It consists of 6532 text images extracted from eight Arabic TV channels. The authors conducted experiments in the ALIF dataset using three approaches, one of which is a commercial OCR software (ABBYY Fine Reader 12). The remaining two approaches are RNN based ones inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref>. Specifically, they used BLSTM coupled with CTC component. The difference between the two approaches is that one of them used CNN based features while the other used DBN based features. For the experiments, the authors used 4152 images for training and the remaining images were distributed among three test sets of 900, 1299 and 1022 images. The evaluation metrics used were Character RR (CRR), Word RR (WRR) and Text RR (TRR). In all experiments, the BLSTM-CTC network with CNN based features produced the best results on all evaluation measures followed by the BLSTM-CTC network with DBN based features.

The first one is the ArabCharSet, which is a set of 46,689 images of single letters and punctuations extracted from 17 h of recordings from Arabic TV news channels. Two other datasets: ArabTrainText (consisting of 7000 text images) and ArabValidText (consisting of 673 text images), were extracted from another 30 h of recordings and were used for training and validating the BLSTM network. One more set, ArabTestText, consisting of 900 text images was used for testing.

They employed a modified version of the beam search (BS) decoding algorithm that uses both responses from LM and LSTM. To control the decoding's effectiveness and efficiency, the authors introduced hyper-parameters and constraints. The decoding scheme is inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65]</ref>'s scheme for speech recognition. As for the LM, the authors consider two approaches: RNN based LMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref> and those combined with the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models, in order to produce a character based Arabic LM. The approach is evaluated on the ALIF dataset of <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60]</ref> where it showed significant improvement over a BLSTM baseline system in addition to a commercial software.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref>, the authors addressed the problem of recognizing Arabic text in videos and natural scenes.

For the videos setting, they used the ALIF dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60]</ref> and the AcTiV dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref>.

Following a patch based approach, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref>, they proposed to combine single layer CNN with a NaiveBayes Nearest Neighbor (NBNN) classifier. For experimentation, they introduced their own MLe2e dataset, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> which consists of 711 scene images covering four different scripts (not including Arabic).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Caption generation</head><p>The problem of automatically generating a description for a given image is an interesting and practical one. Unfortunately, it is almost untouched in the ANLP community. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[76]</ref>, the author addressed this problem for Arabic by associating fragments of the image with root words. The fragments were extracted using a DNN pretrained on the ImageNet dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[77]</ref>. DBN were used to find the most suitable words to be associated with the image and the different root words to be associated with the fragments. Finally, the caption sentences are generating by using dependency tree relations. For evaluation, the author created two datasets. The first one was created by taking 10,000 images from the ImageNet dataset and have human experts add a caption to each image. As for the second dataset, it was created by taking 10,000 images from the Al-Jazeera news website (which has both Arabic and English content). The results were very encouraging as they represent the first approach for Arabic caption generation. Moreover, they were much higher than the simple approach of generating English captions and automatically translating them into Arabic. was based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[79]</ref> and it consisted of two hidden layers.

For the state-level minimum Bayes risk (sMBR) criterion, the authors state that this training algorithm is faster than stochastic gradient descent by a factor of 5.5 and yields a 4.4% relative improvement in word error rate on a 50-h broadcast news task. The authors also state that distributed Hessian-free sMBR training yields relative reductions in word error rate of 713% over crossentropy training with stochastic gradient descent on two larger tasks: Switchboard and DARPA RATS noisy Levantine Arabic. Their best Switchboard DBN achieved a 16.4% WER.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref>, the authors proposed using feature-rich DNN language models (DNN-LM) on Egyptian Arabic. The inputs to the network are a mixture of words and morphemes along with their features.

In these efforts, the authors experimented with various DNN models including: feed-forward NN, CNN, time-delay NN (TDNN), recurrent LSTM, highway LSTM (H-LSTM), and grid LSTM (G-LSTM). The latter produced the best results with a WER of 18.3%. Previous works from the same group used different DNN and CNN models to build Arabic ASR systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[83]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[84]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[85]</ref>.</p><p>Another team participating in the 2016 MGB Challenge was from QCRI.

Another interesting aspect of this work is using four-gram and RNN with MaxEnt connections (RNNME) LM to do re-scoring.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Language modeling</head><p>In previous sections, we discussed the use of LM in different problems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[62]</ref> used them for OCR and <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref> used them for ASR). However, building LM can be studied independently. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[88]</ref>, the authors proposed a character-level LM that can work on English as well as MRL such as Arabic.

The proposed approach has three important parts. The first one is the source encoder, which deals with source words by converting them to dimensional binary vectors, then feeding them into first layer in the source encoder, the output of each layer is considered as an input to the next layer. The second part called joint layer. This layer uses the output of the source encoder as an input in order to get a state of hidden neurons, and infer an output state to use as input to the top level of the output encoder. The third part is the target encoder. Within this part, the output vector is decoded by traversing down words through the output encoder. Because RBMs are bidirectional models, the translation process could be from Arabic to English, and vice versa. During the experiments, the authors studied the effects of network structure, by making the number of layers and the size of the bottom layers in the source and target encoders fixed, but the joint layer could be in different layers and different sizes.</p><p>Another relevant work is <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[91]</ref>, where the authors explored the use of embeddings obtained from different levels of lexical and morpho-syntactic linguistic analysis. They showed that such an approach improved machine translation evaluation into morphologically rich languages (MRL) such as Arabic.</p><p>In another work by the same group <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[97]</ref>, the authors entertained the idea of building a segmenter for one dialect and using it for another dialect. They also proposed to build a single segmenter for all dialects by joining training data for all dialects, thus, eliminating the need for dialect detection as a pre-processing step for segmentation.

This approach requires no preprocessing steps such as lexical, morphological and syntactical analysis. However, in order to achieve better results, post processing error correction techniques are employed. The network is built by placing multiple RNN hidden layers on top of each other, where the outputs of Layer L1 in the stack is considered as an input to the above layer (L2). Since it is bidirectional, this means that each hidden layer gets its input from both the forward and backward layers. RNN has been trained in two different ways; one-to-one network and one-to-many network. One-to-one makes sure to encode every possible diacritization of each single letter, and the input and the output sequences have the same length. On the other hand, within the one-to-many network, the input and the output sequences have different lengths (the output is longer than the input). The results showed that one-to-one outperforms one-to-many. So, the authors continued their experiments using one-to-one network. The experiments made using one-to-one network as an improvement of the performance of RNN to get better accuracy. The experiments tested the impact of the following: weight noise distortion, network size, data size, and influence of the post-processing step. The authors tested their system on 11 books and reported average diacritic and word error rates of 2.09% and 5.82%, respectively. The experiments were conducted using the RNNLIB library <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Another work on diacritization is <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[128]</ref>, where the authors focus on the use of RNN to build a language-independent system for automatic diacritization. They experimented with different hidden layer types ranging from a single feed-forward layer to DBLSTM layers. They add a linear projection after the input layer and use softmax at the output layer. For the experiments, they use the dataset of <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[129]</ref> which consists of hundreds of thousands of words and millions of letters. On this dataset, the MaxEnt approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[129]</ref> (which utilizes language-dependent resources such as segmenter and part of speech (POS) tagger) produced an error rate of 5.1% whereas the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[128]</ref> produced an error rate of 4.85%.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[130,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">131]</ref>, the authors addressed the problem of automatically restoring diacritics. The presented the confused subset resolution (CSR) along with Arabic part-of-speech (PoS) tagging using DNN. The proposed system was evaluated on several dataset and the results showed its superiority over state-of-the-art systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.">Distributed word representations</head><p>Across the previous sections, we have mentioned many works <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">120]</ref> employing different distributed word representations techniques such as word2vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[107]</ref>. The use of such techniques has been shown to produce interesting results especially with DL based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[99]</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[132]</ref>, the authors presented Polyglot, a word embedding technique for multilingual NLP. The authors apply their technique on more than 100 languages (including Arabic) based on the Wikipedia pages of each language. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[132]</ref>, the authors evaluated their word embeddings on part of speech (POS) tagging of few languages (not including Arabic). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[133]</ref>, they showed how to use Polyglot to address the named entity recognition (NER) problem.</p><p>Another effort in the same direction is that of Zahran et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[134]</ref>, in which the authors consider different techniques to build vectorized space representations for Arabic. Specifically, the authors built three models: continuous bag of word (CBOW), Skipgram (SKIP-G), and GloVe <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[135]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[136]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[137]</ref>. They published these mode for public use. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> The authors studied the impact of these representations on two NLP tasks: Query Expansion for Information Retrieval and Short Answer Grading, and the results were encouraging.</p><p>The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[99]</ref> evaluated several Arabic word embedding techniques using their own benchmark, 22 instead of relying on translated benchmarks like previous works. They consider several NLP tasks such as TC and NER.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.">Conclusion</head><p>In this survey, we surveyed the literature related to applying DL for ANLP tasks. Despite the huge impact DL has had on the general NLP community, this is yet to happen for ANLP. We expect this to change as more researchers become aware and convinced of the power of DL.</p></div>
