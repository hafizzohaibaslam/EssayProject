			<abstract>
				<p>We introduce an extension to Multiple Classification Ripple Down Rules (MCRDR), called Contextual MCRDR (C-MCRDR). We apply C-MCRDR knowledge-base systems (KBS) to the Textual Question Answering (TQA) and Natural Language Interface to Databases (NLIDB) paradigms in restricted domains as a type of spoken dialog system (SDS) or conversational agent (CA). C-MCRDR implicitly maintains topical conversational context, and intra-dialog context is retained allowing explicit referencing in KB rule conditions and classifications. To facilitate NLIDB, post-inference C-MCRDR classifications can include generic query referencing-query specificity is achieved by the binding of pre-identified context. In contrast to other scripted, or syntactically complex systems, the KB of the live system can easily be maintained courtesy of the RDR knowledge engineering approach. For evaluation, we applied this system to a pedagogical domain that uses a production database for the generation of offline course-related documents. Our system complemented the domain by providing a spoken or textual question-answering alternative for undergraduates based on the same production database. The developed system incorporates a speech-enabled chatbot interface via Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and experimental results from a live, integrated feedback rating system showed significant user acceptance, indicating the approach is promising, feasible and further work is warranted. Evaluation of the prototype&apos;s viability found the system responded appropriately for 80.3% of participant requests in the tested domain, and it responded inappropriately for 19.7% of requests due to incorrect dialog classifications (4.4%) or out of scope requests (15.3%). Although the semantic range of the evaluated domain was relatively shallow, we conjecture that the developed system is readily adoptable as a CA NLIDB tool in other more semantically-rich domains and it shows promise in single or multi-domain environments.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Conversational Agents (CA) and Natural Language Interfaces to Databases (NLIDB) systems typically require the system developer/author to have high-level skills in constructing either complex semantic or syntactic grammars, or highly technical scripting languages to parse user utterances, as well as database querying languages such as SQL. This introduces a clear, unwarranted separation between the system author and a domain expert -ideally the domain expert should be able to author and maintain the knowledge required by the system, but it is unreasonable to expect domain experts to have high-level technical or linguistic analysis skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">( Androutsopoulos, Ritchie, &amp; Thanisch, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Smith, Crockett, Latham, &amp; Buckingham, 2014</ref> ). We propose a solution to this that allows an expert in the field to maintain knowledge that is used to create CAs with NLIDB capabilities. Our research uses a derivation of the knowledge engineering approach, Ripple Down Rules (RDR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">( Compton &amp; Jansen, 1990 )</ref>, called Contextual MCRDR (C-MCRDR).</p><p>RDR recognises the problem of eliciting knowledge from the domain expert -they have time constraints and they cannot usually provide a wholistic response in attempts to capture their knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">( Biermann, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kang, Compton, &amp; Preston, 1995 )</ref>. RDR removes this knowledge acquisition bottleneck by allowing the expert to build a knowledge-base (KB) incrementally as they only have to provide justification of a conclusion in a local context as it arises. We considered the application of RDR to the CA and NLIDB paradigms, and defined cases to be examples of user dialog -questions and statements that are relevant to the domain. terms, they are classifying each input case (which has patternmatched components of the user utterance as attributes) by a response.</p><p>Standard RDR can only provide a single classification for each case, and a natural extension is to allow multiple classificationsMultiple Classification Ripple Down Rules (MCRDR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">( Kang, 1995 )</ref> is one such extension. In this paper we introduce C-MCRDR, which is a significant extension to MCRDR that facilitates constrained NL conversation via pattern-matching.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Contribution summary</head><p>The key features and contributions of C-MCRDR that facilitate CA and NLIDB services discussed in later sections are as follows: <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. RDR tree structure a x -antecedent, c x -consequent.</p><p>1. Implicit retention of topical conversational context by adopting a stack-based modification to MCRDR's inference mechanism; 2. Intra-dialog contextual referencing via context-based variable definition and assignment (via regular expression patternmatching) of relevant context that is maintained between dialog utterances; 3.

Brittleness mitigation by:</p><p>(a) Pattern-matching of utterances to key terms using a lexical or phrasal paraphrasing approach; (b) Utterance suggestion (rule lookahead) based on current topical context when an utterance is not recognised; 5. ASR transcription correction (when speech is used) by preprocessing terms using a set of corrective rules prior to inference; 6. Speech to Text (STT) correction by pre-processing terms using a set of corrective rules; 7. Dynamic rule maintenance of the live system courtesy of the RDR knowledge engineering approach</p><p>We conducted a usability evaluation study of a pilot system application of C-MCRDR and the results were very promising and positive, which is indicative the C-MCRDR approach to CAs and NLIDB is viable and worth further consideration. We will be further leveraging the system as a component in the command and control of autonomous systems via constrained NL. The paper is organised by the following sections: Section 2 reviews related work associated around RDR and chat-based querying. We present C-MCRDR's modifications to standard MCRDR and the developed conversational system in Section 3 . Sections 4, 5 and 6 detail the developed system's architecture, the methodology adopted in developing and evaluating the chat system, and the results of a pilot evaluation in a target domain respectively. We summarise the main results of this work together with proposals of future research in Sections 7 and 8 .</p></div>

Instead, with RDR, the expert can add rules incrementally: they justify their new classification of a case in the context in which it arises. This is in contrast to other knowledge acquisition methods such as Repertory Grids <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">( Gaines &amp; Shaw, 1993 )</ref>, Formal Concept Analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">( Wille, 1992 )</ref> and standard Case Base Reasoning <ref type="bibr">( Aamodt &amp; Plaza, 1994 )</ref>.</p><p>The original RDR structure is a binary tree, with each node comprised of a rule that consists of an antecedent and a consequent. During inference, the attributes of the current case to be classified are evaluated, starting at the root node <ref type="figure">( Fig. 1 )</ref>. If the antecedent's conditions are satisfied ( a 0 ), evaluation passes to a child node (termed the except edge, here R 2 ). If the parent node's rule conditions are not satisfied, evaluation alternatively follows the other child edge, if-not, R 1 . Either or both of the child nodes may not be present. Classification is the result of the last node to be satisfied. The root node ( R 0 ) usually provides a default classification and a superficial antecedent to ensure all cases will be trivially assigned a class if no further rules are satisfied.</p><p>Multiple Classification Ripple Down Rules (MCRDR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">( Kang, 1995</ref> ) extends RDR's single classification inference outcome by allowing a case to have multiple classifications concurrentlyin MCRDR's n-ary tree, inference considers all child nodes whose parent rules are satisfied, and evaluation concludes with each possible inference path terminated either by a satisfied leaf node or a satisfied node that has no satisfied children.</p><p>RDR and the MCRDR variants have had excellent research and commercial outcomes in the last two or more decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">( Richards, 2009 )</ref>. For example, RDR and variants are used across diverse research and application areas: telehealth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Han et al., 2013 )</ref>; breast cancer detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">( Miranda-Mena et al., 2006</ref> ), legal text citation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">( Galgani, Compton, &amp; Hoffmann, 2015 )</ref>; flight control systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">( Shirazi &amp; Sammut, 2008 )</ref>, robot vision systems <ref type="bibr">( Pham &amp; Sam- mut, 2005</ref> ); induction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gaines &amp; Compton, 1992;</ref>; clinical pathology reporting <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">( Compton, 2011 )</ref>; and a help desk information retrieval mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">( Ho Kang, Yoshida, Motoda, &amp; Compton, 1997 )</ref>. For rapidity of development and implementation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">( Han, Yoon, Kang, &amp; Park, 2014 )</ref> shows the MCRDR-backed KB methodology is closely aligned with the Agile software development approach.</p></div>

During the maintenance of the original system they discovered that an approximate doubling of rule count in the KB only increased the accuracy of the system's diagnosis a couple of percentage points. It would typically take half a day for a new rule to be added due to the constraints of several factors, such as an expert endocrinologist's time, interpretation by the knowledge engineer, and extensive verification and validation to ensure the new Very early systems focused on parsing an NL expression directly into syntactic parse trees, such as the often cited LISP-based LUNAR system <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">( Woods, Kaplan, &amp; Nash-Webber, 1972</ref> ) where the parse tree maps to specific querying language expressions. Later hard-coded semantic grammars were used by systems such as LADDER <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">( Hendrix, Sacerdoti, Sagalowicz, &amp; Slocum, 1978 )</ref>, PLANES ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Waltz, 1978 )</ref> and CHAT-80 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">( Warren &amp; Pereira, 1982 )</ref> to analyse the input expressions to produce semantic concepts in the parse tree.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">KBS Brittleness</head><p>When associated with domain-specific databases, questionanswering systems (QAs) are called Natural Language Interfaces to Data Bases (NLIDB), although such systems are primarily concerned with NL querying interfaces to databases (and not as spoken dialog systems or conversational agents per se ). These systems parse restricted or constrained NL expressions into specific structured query languages such as SQL or XML <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">( Bais, Machkour, &amp; Koutti, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Li, Yang, &amp; Jagadish, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nguyen, Nguyen, &amp; Pham, 2017 )</ref>, or domain-neutral ontologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">( Chaw, 2009 )</ref> allowing non-specialist users to phrase questions against a domain-specific database in a constrained subset of NL. One such example is NaLIX ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Li et al., 2005</ref> ). NaLIX's intent is in essence a natural language querying system, with English grammar terms aligned using a machine learning approach to classify terms with associated typical querying constructs such as value joins and nesting. The intermediate representation language approach in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bais et al., 2016 )</ref> also adopts machine learning to generate context free grammars for domain-dependent terminal symbols after the input has been tokenised and tagged by part-of-speech analysis. Localised dictionaries again match schema-specific attributes to NL synonyms, an approach that is widely used, but requires redevelopment when porting to other domains. The ASKME system <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">( Chaw, 2009</ref> ) uses a specially restricted version of English called Computer Processable Language (CLP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">( Clark et al., 2005</ref> ) to avoid issues such as ambiguity that arise in NL processing of general English. CLP -which has restrictions on grammar, style and vocabulary, is interpreted by a syntactic parser, however it still requires a degree of user training to teach them how to construct their requests. The SEEKER and Aneesah systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">( Shabaz, O'Shea, Crockett, &amp; Latham, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Smith et al., 2014</ref> ) are similar NLIDBs coupled to CAs. SEEKER uses a commercial CA to map appropriate SQL templates to evaluate against an underlying database and in contrast to other systems, it allows a targeted followup of refinement of query results via a GUI. CA scripts are used to pattern-match keywords in utterances, and then the most appropriate SQL template is chosen via an expert system based on matched variables in the utterance; the SQL templates are produced from a pre-establishment phase requiring a lengthy questionnaire capturing common NL phrases used and their resulting associated queries. In contrast, although somewhat similar, <ref type="bibr">Aneesah ( Shabaz et al., 2015 )</ref> dynamically builds an SQL query (although it is not clear how the mapping of utterance to query is performed) after a CA engine utilises a scripted-capture of user utterances. In both cases misinterpretations require careful, offline maintenance of the CA engine scripts and both are evaluated via satisfaction and task-based questionnaires of very small participant groups (10 and 20 participants respectively). A key component of SEEKER is the ability to further refine query results. We would argue the addition of further child rules associated with querying in the C-MCRDR decision tree allows for additional context (variables) where relevant, and thus more specific queries can be evaluated when and if the user provides more context.</p><p>An alternative approach, instead of pre-defining query templates to potentially map to user input, is to automatically generate all search queries based on a corpus of existing questions in community question answering (cQA) platforms such as Stack Exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">( Figueroa, 2017 )</ref>. This means a very large corpus of queries is generated against the existing knowledge-base that can then be used to provide related questions (and answers) to a user's initial query. The authors extract a number of attributes from a query based on computed results from various sources including CoreNLP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Manning et al., 2014</ref> ) and WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">( Miller, 1995 )</ref> -such as senThese NLIDB and NLIDB with CA approaches are advantageous to the user as they are not required to learn and adopt technical database query formalisms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Smith et al., 2014</ref> ), but practicalities of the system's linguistic constraints leads to frustration -the user must overcome the inherent brittleness of the system and still be conversant in the linguistic coverage as to what and cannot be understood ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Androutsopoulos et al., 1995 )</ref>, and a mild appreciation of underlying database schemas is hard to avoid. To try and overcome this schema unfamiliarity, NaLIX ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Li et al., 2005</ref> ) employs an ontological-based term expansion module integrated with WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">( Miller, 1995 )</ref>. Matched terms however require some final markup of the actual domain-dependant schemas to be undertaken. Another example of overcoming brittleness is a paraphrase generation system ( Oh, Choi, Gweon, Heo, &amp; Ryu, 2015 ) which automatically generates paraphrases (for Korean), initially based on Korean thesauri. We adopt the same approach in our system, although we do not automatically generate the lexical or phrasal paraphrases <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">( Madnani &amp; Dorr, 2010 )</ref> -the onus is on the domain expert to do so manually when they populate the dictionary. However, the C-MCRDR system prompts users with utterance suggestions (see Section 3.4 ) when their utterance is not recognised.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">RDR-Based CAs and NLIDB</head><p>The KbQAS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nguyen et al., 2017 )</ref> and LEXA classification systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Galgani et al., 2015</ref> ) are close to our research due to the fact they apply RDR to generate rules for the semantic analysis of tokenised and tagged input. KbQAS answers Vietnamese questions whereas LEXA examines legal citations, and both use the GATE NLP analysis framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">( Cunningham, Maynard, Bontcheva, &amp; Tablan, 2002</ref> ). The rule knowledge acquisition (KA) stages in KbQAS require the domain expert to have significant knowledge and expertise in the JAPE grammar and its annotations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cunningham et al., 1999</ref> ). This is contrary to one of our aims i.e. to develop a system in arbitrary domains where the domain expert does not require significant linguistic or programming skills such as JAPE. The KA interface has to be designed carefully to provide a suitable abstraction of the syntactic and semantic interpretations of the rule attributes added to the KB.</p><p>In contrast to pure NLIDB systems, we do not map input expressions directly (or indirectly) to database queries; instead, the expert can predefine queries without SQL syntactical knowledge (via a simplified GUI interface) that are themselves expressed in an intermediate XML form for database independence, and refer to them as required when determining the appropriate response to an NL input question. In effect, the expert applying our system to their domain incrementally develops rules analogous to authoring chat scripts for a chatbot (for example, the ALICE chatbot and AIML ( Wallace, 2011 )), but they are not required to know an esoteric authoring syntax.</p></div>

Here rules are added to the KB based on sequential data obtained from logs of a flight simulator's instrumentation and sensors. The sensor data are the results of a pilots' sub-cognitive reactive evaluations of conditions. The context is thus between each sequential set of attributes that have been logged (e.g. the aileron has adjusted by 5 degrees from the previous reading ). This is contrast to our system, as context in LDRDR is during the KA phase, whereas our contextual retention is across case-based inference requests (i.e. post acquisition). <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> C-MCRDR Algorithm: Inference function I ( case, rule ) returns a set of n satisfied rules { r 0 .. r n }.</p></div>

We observed the clear, clean separation of knowledge from the inference engine in a contemporary KBS is analogous to the separation of chat scripts (such as AIML) from a chatbot program <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">( Compton, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wallace, 2011 )</ref>. Chat scripts embody conversational responses as a form of knowledge, and it is this knowledge that can be captured and represented in a KBS approach. Inter-domain applicability, commonly criticised for CA and NLIDB systems, can be partially addressed in our system by providing interface support for KB rule, query, dictionary and ASR correction rule reuse for relevant commonality between domains. We detail the modification and features of C-MCRDR to support CA services and NLIDB in this section.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">INITIALISE: LET stack S ¡û ?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Topical conversational context -stacking</head><p>/animal/ . More specifically, we may be more interested in which animal matched, such as aardvark . As a dialog progresses, CHuman chat discourse follows one or more topics during a conversation, the automated detection of which is an ongoing area of research (e.g. TF-IDF approaches, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">( Adams &amp; Martell, 2008 )</ref>). Humans naturally maintain an appreciation of what is being discussed without having to continually re-emphasise it. For example, the following shows a stilted, unnatural conversational excerpt:</p><p>Speaker 1: "The weather is going to be bad today. As for the weather , the prognosis is for rain." Speaker 2: "What will be the weather's temperature?" Speaker 1: "The weather's temperature will be 10 degrees Celsius."</p><p>A speaker intuitively understands the current topic is weather -all subsequent explicit mentions of weather are redundant. To achieve this more natural, contextual response, the C-MCRDR inference algorithm is altered by influencing the starting rules where we begin inference in the decision tree. We achieved this via a stacking of inference results <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">( Glina &amp; Kang, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mak, Kang, Sam- mut, &amp; Kadous, 2004</ref> ) -each stack frame contains a set of satisfied rule(s) from the previous inference request. Frames are popped from the stack in LIFO order, and inference simply assumes each rule in the frame's ruleset is satisfied as a starting point to evaluate child rules. For each dialog session, C-MCRDR implicitly assumes each case is part of a temporal sequence (i.e. components of a continuing dialog) and it is not initially independent of other preceding cases. If no child rules are satisfied in the current stack frame, we temporarily discard the frame and attempt inference again with the new top of the stack rule set. Eventually, if no further stacked rule sets are available, the default rule is satisfied.</p><p>The C-MCRDR inference algorithm is summarised in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> . It should be noted frames are never deleted from the inference result stack during a dialog session, and inference result frames only containing R 0 are never pushed to the stack (apart from the first frame). Future work may relax the former constraint in situations where a topic may need to be invalidated. MCRDR can retain this matched data via context variables . Context variables (together with system context variables, or default values ) could be considered as a simplified notion of slots in a frame as first put forward by <ref type="bibr">Minsky ( Minksy, 1975 )</ref>, with slots retained (temporally) across all subsequent frames. Variables are defined by the domain expert (guided by a GUI) with simple metarules referring to dictionary terms, literal values, or arbitrary regular expressions. The expert can reference variable values in a rule's antecedent or consequent with an XML-style syntax (not shown), which is also guided by a GUI. Variable assignment can also occur as a side-effect of a consequent (via an action -this feature was implemented but not used in the pilot system).</p><p>Implementation practicalities dictate that the developed system adopts a closed-world approach -this means the domain expert can pre-define any assumed factual world knowledge that is required. We take the approach of simply defining meta-rules again in the form of system context variables with default values that can be overridden by more specific context. For example, consider the question, "What year is it? ". The expert can define via a GUI, a default value such as ( @SYSTEMyear = 2018 ). A standard variable, ( @year ) would override this value if an utterance contained the appropriate variable-matching criteria (for example, "The year is 2021 "). This default context has extremely useful consequences when binding queries as detailed in the next section.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Context variables</head><p>An additional aspect to maintain conversational (or factual) continuity is the retention of context-specific data found in cases as they arise on a temporal basis.</p><p>The results of inference in C-MCRDR are classifications of a user utterance. These classifications can include references to queries or variable values (called literals in the implementation) that must be resolved (bound) before a response is returned to the user. Inclusion of unresolved classifications can significantly reduce the number of rules and rule redundancy in the KB -final classification specificity is achieved by binding conversational contextual data to the inference results in a post-inference phase by the system's output parser. This supports NLIDB interaction when the specific postbind classifications include the results of database queries. The system supports the domain expert to create query templates by a suitable GUI interface, and it guides the expert to chose querybinding context (usually variable references), and the query template results are XML-based (for RDBMS independence). The query  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> now allows C-MCRDR conversations such as:</p><p>1. "what is the name of the polygon with 7 sides? " -heptagon .</p><p>2.

" -blue This example exhibits an 80% reduction of the rule count (10 rules to 2) in the KB (excluding the default, R 0 rule) compared to the non-query example shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> .  To address brittleness, in addition to adopting a paraphrasing approach, the system can provide examples of utterances that are understood from the current context -this is triggered if the last user utterance only satisfied the default root rule (which is I don't understand ), although a meta-rule, What can I say? is also a trigger. Suggestions are selected based on attributes that will satisfy a subset of child rules (a lookahead) from the starting ruleset in the top stack frame and they are varied by randomly selecting instances in any lexical terms referred to by the rule attributes. For example, in our pedagogical domain, a conversational snippet might be (the underlined lexical term has been replaced between each suggestion):</p><p>templates abstract the underlying referential table schema (by a simple mapping), so queries are potentially reusable in other domains that have compatible table schema. Standard queries (such as a simple primary-key join) can be defined for cross-domain applicability by the system GUI.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1.">Rule-count reduction</head><p>Substantial rule-count reduction in the KB is a significant beneficial side-effect to the inclusion of post-inference queries; standard MCRDR tends to create larger decision trees compared to other inductive methods (due to over-generalisation and subsequent rule refinement by the domain expert for special cases as they arise <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">( Kang, 1995 )</ref>), and the complexity of the decision tree is increased as a consequence. In domains where considerable knowledge is already present in the form of in situ databases (as is the case for our target pedagogical domain), the potential rule-bloat can be drastically reduced by incorporating querying into the interim inference results.</p><p>The significant reduction in KB rule bloat is best demonstrated by an example. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> gives an example of a question's classification of regular polygons and instances of their colour prior to any optimisations. Here ten MCRDR rules are required to answer questions associated with the polygon's name and colour such as "what is the colour of polygon with 5 sides? ". Assuming the existence of a domain database <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">( Table 2 )</ref>, the KB can be reduced to two C-MCRDR rules in addition to the default rule <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">( Fig. 3 )</ref>. Here the literal C-MCRDR rule conclusions containing query references are shown -these are parsed by the system's output parser and the corresponding query XML code (not shown) is executed with the releThe developed system as detailed in the next section also includes a domain-specific feature to help overcome brittleness. If the system is unable to provide results to the client user's satisfaction, the client browser interface provides a button to request unit coordinator assistance if the client enters their personal email address. This triggers an automatic inference request for the lecturer details associated with the unit currently being discussed (e.g. what is the lecturer's email address? ), and the lecturer is then emailed a transcript of the entire conversation. The lecturer can then respond to the client's unfulfilled queries via email exchange.</p></div>

The KB was constructed by the primary author with an anticipatory coverage of the key items that students refer to in the documentation system, and during evaluation, no rules were added or refined (even though C-MCRDR KA could have easily facilitated misclassification corrections). Participants were asked to assess both the usability of the system and the appropriateness of each of the system's responses to their questions on a 5-point Likert scale via an integrated feedback system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Evaluation setup</head><p>A pilot C-MCRDR system was implemented, with a KB that was targeted against a suitable domain. Criteria used to determine a suitable domain included requiring the existence of an in situ database, a domain expert with suitable knowledge of the exisiting systems, suitability of a question and answer paradigm approach, and the availability of participants for a feasibility evaluation study. A web-based documentation generation and retrieval system for course data at the author's University matched the criteria. As the primary author of this manuscript was the original software developer for the existing documentation generation system, the author assumed the domain expert role. The documentation system is frequently accessed by undergraduate students (who are recruited as participant volunteers) and its database contains details about each unit taught by the ICT discipline, such as a unit's title, 6 character unit code, lecturing staff, teaching pattern, learning outcomes, assessment items and due dates etcetera.</p><p>One of the key features of C-MCRDR is the reduction in rule count due to post-inference querying and implicit reference to topical context. This is demonstrated by the results from the target domain: here the ICT Discipline delivered 34 distinct units that required generation of unit outline documents during the datagathering phase of this research, Semester 1 2017. Associated with these units were 140 individual assessment tasks (giving an average of 4 assessment items per unit), 20 coordinating lecturers and 23 distinct teaching teams (consisting of 1 or 2 people). Overall, in terms of database accesses, each individual unit outline document refers to 28 specific database fields, and each of the 4 associated assessment items refer to two database fields. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> shows the standard MCRDR approach's minimum number of rules needed to provide the same classification outcomes as C-MCRDR in this domain.</p><p>The totals shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> are the number of MCRDR rules required to provide complete coverage of equivalent responses for each distinct database data item. Without post-inference query referencing, the contents of the referential database would in effect need to be flattened and then directly encoded by rules in the KB. For a relatively simple domain, such a high rule count (1225) is excessive.</p><p>Overall the C-MCRDR KB defined 36 rules, which is a 97.06% rule count reduction compared to the equivalent MCRDR KB. For illustrative purposes, part of the KB from both approaches is partially visualised in Figs. 5 and 6 , with only 4 (of 36) attributes of the dialog considered. Here we observe a signification rule count reduction (C-MCRDR -5 rules, MCRDR -137 rules). Example con- <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> Comparison user dialog (1: C-MCRDR, 2: MCRDR).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2.">Question and response categorisation</head><p>Once the sessional data was obtained, we then manually examined the log files to categorise the system's responses to inference requests -was the participant's utterance valid, did the system capture the correct intent, etcetera. This lead to the definition of four categories (see <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> ), that were applied in the discussion of results that follow.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.3.">System performance</head><p>Inspection of the logged satisfied rule frequency results shows that 43% of inference requests (which result in Rule 0 responses, <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> Inference Result Categories (C). <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">C  Inference source and response   1  Valid question, valid system response  2  Valid question, misinterpreted system response  3</ref> Valid question, invalid (default) system response 4</p><p>Invalid question, default system response categories C3 and C4) did not produce a useful result for the user, while responses that satisfied Rules 1 -36 (categories C1 and C2) had a combined frequency of 57%. However, this does not consider when Rule 0 responses are appropriate, or when Rules 1 -36 responses are inappropriate, so we instead consider two overall categories -appropriate system responses and inappropriate system responses . In <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> , all inference requests ( N i ) are grouped into their C1 -C4 categories and expressed as a percentage of the total of all inference requests. We can then summarise the system's performance in terms of the appropriateness of system response: </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">[ NCat1 = 0 . 52 ¡Á N i ], R 2 = 0 . 93 , p &lt; 2 . 2 ¡Á 10 ?16 .</formula></div>

This result can be improved by reducing the category C2 and C3 rates -these types of responses can be corrected by the addition of new rules which in C-MCRDR terms is a refinement of the final classifications, however during evaluation this was not conducted; C2 responses indicates key terms in the utterance (the actual intent) have been ignored or misinterpreted, whereas C3 responses indicates the system is unable to respond to a valid (but out-of-scope) question. The category C4 rates, while still appropriate as responses to nonsensical input, are difficult to reduce without more intensive user training, further brittleness mitigation, or constraining input mechanisms to text-only (as the largest contributor to this category came from ASR errors -see Section 6.2.3 ). Further rule maintenance would improve the overall results and this will be considered in future work.</p><p>Analysing system performance by category C1 responses alone yields <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8</ref> . The Ideal response rate is shown, [ NCat1 = N i ] as is the Best fit linear regression model, [ NCat1 = 0 . 52 ¡Á N i ]. This model shows fundamentally, across all participation sessions, 52% of inference requests are valid and receive a non-default response. There are two obvious outliers -one at N i = 8 , NCat1 = 1 and another at N i = 14 , NCat1 = 1 . In both cases their primary input was via speech (75% and 78% of their requests respectively), and they failed to articulate a single unit code. <ref type="table">Table 8</ref> contains a summary of the linear regression model results for each category against the number of inference requests (scatter plots are not shown), which approximately agree with the results in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> . For categories C2, C3 and C4 there is considerable variability as indicated by the low R 2 values; there were several outliers in the data, for example, for the session with N i = 12, 5 out of 12 (42%) of requests were category 2 misinterpretations (the actual intents were out-of-scope). Examples of utterances in all categories can be found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 9</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.4.">Automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors</head><p>The speech input and output components of the system were not fully utilised or embraced in this domain. This is not surprising as most evaluation was conducted in noisy laboratory-based environments which made spoken questions and responses harder to correctly recognise and hear. There was a scarcity of data logged with only 11 sessions using speech; the summary is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 10</ref> . The ASR Error Rate is the mean percentage of ASR transcription errors that occurred across all session requests that used speech, and the ASR Duration is the average measure of when speech was used in a session, how many requests were actually conducted by speech.</p><p>The high standard deviations in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 10</ref> are indicative that particular (outlier) users had greater success with speech input. For example, a session at N i = 27 used ASR for 90% of their session, yet only suffered 11% ASR errors. In contrast, a session at N i = 14 used ASR for 79% of their session duration, and suffered 64% ASR errors. The majority of participation sessions immediately modified the input mechanism from speech to text, but for those sessions that started with speech, 72.7% persevered with it for an average of 75.91% of the session requests. We mitigate ASR transcription errors for common mistakes (for example, correcting unitcode utterances) via rule-based corrections. During evaluation however, no additional corrective rules were added beyond the initial set.</p></div>

Overall feedback was very positive -the highest frequency scores (on a 5-point Likert    (18.1%) of feedback was at the ambivalence level (3). Unsurprisingly the default rule (Rule 0) rates poorly. This is indicative of not receiving a useful response, although 3 sessions interestingly rated this rule as rank 5. Rule 0 achieved the lowest feedback score, but the highest number of feedback responses (38).</p><p>scale, 1 = I am very dissatisfied , 5 = I am very satisfied ) were ratings at levels 4 and 5 (28.57% and 33.33% respectively), and there was a combined (levels 1 and 2) negative rating of 14.28% -see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 9</ref> .

The associated, relatively high negative feedback rate of 18.09% possibly stems from the fact that users may not realise the system is providing an appropriate response (even if it is I don't understand ), which may lead to some frustration. When considering system misbehaviour, unsurprisingly the combined negative feedback scores are high (57.57%), however it is apparent that users are more reticent to leave feedback for system misbehaviour compared to appropriate behaviour, as this type of response only received about a third of feedback responses ( | N i | = 33 compared to | N i | = 94 ). <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 11</ref> summarises the overall counts of feedback provided for each individual category.

Consideration will also be given to expand the rulebased approach in correcting ASR transcription errors, especially when IPA devices are used -this includes determining regions in the decision tree where a more contextual correction mechanism can be adopted. Inter-domain applicability will addressed by providing further support for KB rule, query, dictionary and ASR correction rule reuse through suitable interface options, saving a domain expert considerable time when considering a new domain. The developed system will also be integrated as the primary user interface component in a wider study for the control of autonomous systems by natural language in order to achieve hierarchical task-based goals.</p><p>84.0% ( | N i | = 63 ) of those were positive feedback (Rank 4: 12%, | N i | = 9 , Rank 5: 72%, | N i | = 54 ).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
