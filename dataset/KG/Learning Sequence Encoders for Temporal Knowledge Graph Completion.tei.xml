<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Knowledge graphs (KGs) are used to organize, manage, and retrieve structured information. The incompleteness of most real-world KGs has stimulated research on predicting missing relations between entities. A KG is of the form G = (E, R), where E is a set of entities and, R is a set of relation types or predicates. One can represent G as a set of triples of the form (subject, predicate, object), denoted as (s, p, o). The link prediction problem seeks the most probable completion of a triple (s, p, ?) or (?, p, o) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Nickel et al., 2016)</ref>. We focus on temporal KGs where some triples are augmented with time information and the link prediction problem asks for the most probable completion given time information. More formally, a temporal KG G = (E, R, T ) is a KG where Most approaches to link prediction are characterized by a scoring function that operates on the entity and relation type embeddings of a triple ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bordes et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Yang et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Guu et al., 2015)</ref>. Learning representations that carry temporal information is challenging due to the sparsity and irregularities of time expressions. It is possible, however, to turn time expressions into sequences of tokens expressing said temporal information. Moreover, character-level architectures for language modeling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Zhang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kim et al., 2016</ref>) operate on characters as atomic units to derive word embeddings. Inspired by these models, we propose a method to incorporate time information into standard embedding approaches for link prediction. We learn time-aware representations by training a recursive neural network with sequences of tokens representing the time predicate and the digits of the timestamp, if they exist. The last hidden state of the recurrent network is combined with standard scoring functions from the KG completion literature. </p></div>

This facilitates the encoding of relation types with temporal tokens such as "since," "until," and the digits of timestamps. Moreover, the RNN encoding provides an inductive bias for parameter sharing among similar timestamps (e.g., those occurring in the same century). Finally, our method can be combined with all existing scoring functions. bornIn 1y 9y 8y 6y</p><p>Figure 1: Learning time-aware representations.</p><p>?

These scoring functions do not take temporal information into account. Given a temporal KG where some triples are augmented with temporal information, we can decompose a given (possibly incomplete) timestamp into a sequence consisting of some of the following temporal tokens</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">year 0 ﹞ 1 ﹞ 2 ﹞ 3 ﹞ 4 ﹞ 5 ﹞ 6 ﹞ 7 ﹞ 8 ﹞ 9 month 01 ﹞ 02 ﹞ 03 ﹞ 04 ﹞ 05 ﹞ 06 ﹞ 07 ﹞ 08 ﹞ 09 ﹞ 10 ﹞ 11 ﹞ 12 day 0 ﹞ 1 ﹞ 2 ﹞ 3 ﹞ 4 ﹞ 5 ﹞ 6 ﹞ 7 ﹞ 8 ﹞ 9</formula></div>

Popular examples of scoring functions are Hence, temporal tokens have a vocabulary size of 32. Moreover, for each triple we can extract a sequence of predicate tokens that always consists of the relation type token and, if available, a temporal modifier token such as "since" or "until." We refer to the concatenation of the predicate token sequence and (if available) the sequence of temporal tokens as the predicate sequence p seq . Now, a temporal KG can be represented as a collection of triples of the form (s, p seq , o), wherein the predicate sequence may include temporal information. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> lists some examples of such facts from a temporal KG and their corresponding predicate sequence. We use the suffix y, m and d to indicate whether the digit corresponds to year, month or day information.

These political events relate entities (e.g. countries, presidents...) to a number of other entities via logical predicates (e.g. 'Make a visit' or 'Express intent to meet or negotiate'). Additional information can be found at http://www.icews.com/. The repository is organized in dumps that contain the events that occurred each year from 1995 to 2015. We created two temporal KGs out of this repository, i) a short-range version that contains all events in 2014, and ii) a long-range version that contains all events occurring between 2005-2015. We refer to these two data sets as <ref type="bibr">ICEWS 2014 and</ref><ref type="bibr">ICEWS 2005-15</ref>, respectively. Due to the large number of entities we selected a subset of the most frequently occurring entities in the graph and all facts where both the subject and object are part of this subset of entities. We split the facts into training, validation and test in a proportion of 80%/10%/10%, respectively. The protocol for the creation of these data sets is identical to the onw followed in previous work <ref type="bibr">(Bor- des et al., 2013</ref>    ICEWS data sets, YAGO15K does contain temporal modifiers; namely, 'occursSince' and 'occursUntil'. Contrary to previous work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Leblay and Chekol, 2018)</ref>, all facts maintain time information in the same level of granularity as one can find in the original dumps these data sets come from. We also experimented with the temporal facts from the WIKIDATA data set 4 extracted in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Leblay and Chekol, 2018)</ref>. Only information regarding the year is available for these facts, since the authors discarded information of finer granularity. All facts are framed in a time interval (i.e. they contain the temporal modifiers 'occursSince' and 'occursUntil'). Facts annotated with a single point-in-time are associated with that time-point as start and end time. Due to the large number of entities of this data set, which hinders the computation of standard KG completion metrics, we selected a subset of the most frequent entities and kept all facts where both the subject and object are part of this subset of entities. This set of filtered facts was split into training, validation and test in the same proportion as before. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> lists some statistics of the temporal KGs.

We also report the filtered setting as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bordes et al., 2013)</ref>. The mean of all computed ranks is the Mean Rank (lower is better) and the fraction of correct entities ranked in the top n is called hits@n (higher is better). We also compute the Mean Reciprocal Rank (higher is better) which is less susceptible to outliers.</p><p>Recent work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Leblay and Chekol, 2018</ref>) evaluates different approaches for performing link prediction in temporal KGs. The approach that learns independent representations for each timestamp and use these representations as translation vectors, similarly to ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bordes et al., 2013)</ref>, leads to the best results. This approach is called VECTOR-BASED TTRANSE, though for the shake of simplicity in the paper we refer to it as TTRANSE. We compare our approaches TA-TRANSE and TA-DISTMULT against TTRANSE, and the standard embedding methods TRANSE and DISTMULT. For all approaches, we used ADAM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kingma and Ba, 2014</ref>) for parameter learning in a mini-batch setting with a learning rate of 0.001, the categorical cross-entropy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kadlec et al., 2017)</ref> as loss function and the number of epochs was set to 500. We validated every 20 epochs and stopped learning whenever the MRR values on the validation set decreased. The batch size was set to 512 and the number of negative samples to 500 for all experiments. The embedding size is d=100. We apply dropout ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Srivastava et al., 2014</ref>) for all embeddings. We validated the dropout from the values {0, 0.4} for all experiments. For TA-TRANSE and TA-DISTMULT, the activation gate 考 g is the sigmoid function; 考 c and 考 h were chosen to be linear activation functions. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> and 4 list the results for the KG completion tasks. TA-TRANSE and TA-DISTMULT systematically improve TRANSE and DISTMULT in MRR, hits@10 and hits@1 in almost all cases. Mean rank is a metric that is very susceptible to outliers and hence these improvements are not consistent. TTRANSE learns independent representations for each timestamp contained in the training set. At test time, timestamps unseen during training are represented by null vectors. This explains that TTRANSE is only competitive in YAGO15K, wherein the number of distinct timestamps is very small (see #Distinct TS in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2)</ref> and thus enough training examples exist to learn robust timestamp embeddings. TTRANSE's performance is similar to that of TA-TRANSE, our time-aware version of TRANSE, in WIKIDATA. Similarly, TTRANSE can learn robust timestamp representations because of the small number of distinct timestamps of this data set. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> shows a comparison of the training loss of TRANSE and TA-TRANSE for YAGO15K. Under the same set-up, TA-TRANSE's ability to learn from time information leads to a training loss lower than that of TRANSE. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows a t-SNE <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Maaten and Hinton, 2008</ref>) visualization of the embeddings learned for the predicate sequence p seq = [playsFor, occursSince, date], where date corresponds to the date token sequence. This illustrates that the learned relation type embeddings carry temporal information.</p></div>
