<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Information Extraction refers to the automatic extraction of structured information such as entities, relationships between entities, and attributes describing entities from unstructured sources. This enables much richer forms of queries on the abundant unstructured sources than possible with keyword searches alone. When structured and unstructured data co-exist, information extraction makes it possible to integrate the two types of sources and pose queries spanning them. The extraction of structure from noisy, unstructured sources is a challenging task, that has engaged a veritable community of researchers for over two decades now. With roots in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community, the topic of structure extraction now engages many different communities spanning machine learning, information retrieval, database, web, and document analysis. Early extraction tasks were concentrated around the identification of named entities, like people and company names and relationship among them from natural language text. The scope of this research was strongly influenced by two competitions, the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) <ref type="bibr">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">198]</ref> and Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">159]</ref> program. The advent of the Internet considerably increased the extent and diversity of applications depending on various forms of information extraction. Applications such as comparison shopping, and other automatic portal creation applications, lead to a frenzy of research and commercial activity on the topic. As society became more data oriented with easy online access to both structured and unstructured data, new applications of structure extraction came around.</p><p>To address the needs of these diverse applications, the techniques of structure extraction have evolved considerably over the last two decades. Early systems were rule-based with manually coded rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">127,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">181]</ref>. As manual coding of rules became tedious, algorithms for automatically learning rules from examples were developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">195]</ref>. As extraction systems were targeted on more noisy unstructured sources, rules were found to be too brittle. Then came the age of statistical learning, where in parallel two kinds of techniques were deployed: generative models based on Hidden Markov Models <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">189]</ref> and conditional models based on maximum entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">118,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">135,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">143,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">177]</ref>. Both were superseded by global conditional models, popularly called Conditional Random Fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[125]</ref>. As the scope of extraction systems widened to require a more holistic analysis of a document's structure, techniques from grammar construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[191,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">213]</ref> were developed. In spite of this journey of varied techniques, there is no clear winner. Rule-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">113,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">141,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">190]</ref> and statistical methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">146,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b220">220]</ref> continue to be used in parallel depending on the nature of the extraction task. There also exist hybrid models <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">89,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">140,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">173]</ref> that attempt to reap the benefits of both statistical and rule-based methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Applications</head><p>Structure extraction is useful in a diverse set of applications. We list a representative subset of these, categorized along whether the applications are enterprise, personal, scientific, or Web-oriented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.1">Enterprise Applications</head><p>News Tracking: A classical application of information extraction, which has spurred a lot of the early research in the NLP community, is automatically tracking specific event types from news sources.</p><p>The popular MUC <ref type="bibr">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">198]</ref> and ACE <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> competitions are based on the extraction of structured entities like people and company names, and relations such as "is-CEO-of" between them. Other popular tasks are: tracking disease outbreaks <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[99]</ref>, and terrorist events from news sources. Consequently there are several research publications <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b208">209]</ref> and many research prototypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">181]</ref> that target extraction of named entities and their relationship from news articles. Two recent applications of information extraction on news articles are: the automatic creation of multimedia news by integrating video and pictures of entities and events annotated in the news articles, 1 and hyperlinking news articles to background information on people, locations, and companies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Customer Care: Any customer-oriented enterprise collects many forms of unstructured data from customer interaction; for effective management these have to be closely integrated with the enterprise's own structured databases and business ontologies. This has given rise to many interesting extraction problems such as the identification of product names and product attributes from customer emails, linking of customer emails to a specific transaction in a sales database <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, the extraction of merchant name and addresses from sales invoices <ref type="bibr" target="#b226">[226]</ref>, the extraction of repair records from insurance claim forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[168]</ref>, the extraction of customer moods from phone conversation transcripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[112]</ref>, and the extraction of product attribute value pairs from textual product descriptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[97]</ref>.</p><p>Data Cleaning: An essential step in all data warehouse cleaning processes is converting addresses that are stored as flat strings into their structured forms such as road name, city, and state. Large customeroriented organizations like banks, telephone companies, and universities store millions of addresses. In the original form, these addresses have little explicit structure. Often for the same person, there are different address records stored in different databases. During warehouse construction, it is necessary to put all these addresses in a standard canonical format where all the different fields are identified and duplicates removed. An address record broken into its structured fields not only enables better querying, it also provides a more robust way of doing deduplication and householding -a process that identifies all addresses belonging to the same household <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">187]</ref>.</p><p>Classified Ads: Classified ads and other listings such as restaurant lists is another domain with implicit structure that when exposed can be invaluable for querying. Many researchers have specifically targeted such record-oriented data in their extraction research <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[150,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">156,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">157,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">195]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.2">Personal Information Management</head><p>Personal information management (PIM) systems seek to organize personal data like documents, emails, projects and people in a structured inter-linked format <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">74]</ref>. The success of such systems will depend on being able to automatically extract structure from existing predominantly file-based unstructured sources. Thus, for example we should be able to automatically extract from a PowerPoint file, the author of a talk and link the person to the presenter of a talk announced in an email. Emails, in particular, have served as testbeds for many extraction tasks such as locating mentions of people names and phone numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[113,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">152]</ref>, and inferring request types in service centers <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[63]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.3">Scientific Applications</head><p>The recent rise of the field of bio-informatics has broadened the scope of earlier extractions from named entities, to biological objects such as proteins and genes. A central problem is extracting from paper repositories such as Pubmed, protein names, and their interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">166]</ref>. Since the form of entities like Gene and Protein names is very different from classical named entities like people and companies, this task has helped to broaden the techniques used for extraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.4">Web Oriented Applications</head><p>Citation Databases: Many citation databases on the web have been created through elaborate structure extraction steps from sources ranging from conference web sites to individual home pages. Popular amongst these are Citeseer <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[126]</ref>, Google Scholar 3 and Cora <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[144]</ref>. The creation of such databases requires structure extraction at many different levels starting from navigating web sites for locating pages containing publication records, extracting individual publication records from a HTML page, extracting title, authors, and references from paper PDFs, and segmenting citation strings into individual authors, title, venue, and year fields. The resulting structured database provides significant value added in terms of allowing forward references, and aggregate statistics such as author-level citation counts.</p><p>Opinion Databases: There are innumerable web sites storing unmoderated opinions about a range of topics, including products, books, movies, people, and music. Many of the opinions are in free text form hidden behind Blogs, newsgroup posts, review sites, and so on. The value of these reviews can be greatly enhanced if organized along structured fields. For example, for products it might be useful to find out for each feature of the product, the prevalent polarity of opinion <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[131,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">167]</ref>. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[160]</ref> for a recent survey.</p><p>Community Websites: Another example of the creation of structured databases from web documents is community web sites such as DBLife <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[78]</ref> and Rexa 4 that tracks information about researchers, conferences, talks, projects, and events relevant to a specific community. The creation of such structured databases requires many extraction steps: locating talk announcements from department pages, extracting names of speakers and titles from them <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[189]</ref>, extracting structured records about a conference from a website <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[111]</ref>, and so on.</p><p>Comparison Shopping: There is much interest in creating comparison shopping web sites that automatically crawl merchant web sites to find products and their prices which can then be used for comparison shopping <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[87]</ref>. As web technologies evolved, most large merchant web sites started getting hidden behind forms and scripting languages. Consequently, the focus has shifted to crawling and extracting information from form-based web sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[104]</ref>. The extraction of information from form-based web sites is an active research area not covered in this survey.</p><p>Ad Placement on Webpages: Suppose a web site wants to place advertisements of a product next to the text that both mentions the product and expresses a positive opinion about it. Both of these subtasks: extracting mentions of products and the type of opinion expressed on the product are examples of information extraction tasks that can facilitate the burgeoning Internet ad placement industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Structured Web Searches: Finally, a grand challenge problem for information extraction is allowing structured search queries involving entities and their relationships on the World Wide Web. Keyword searches are adequate for getting information about entities, which are typically nouns or noun phrases. They fail on queries that are looking for relationships between entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. For example, if one wants to retrieve documents containing text of the form "Company X acquired Company Y", then keywords alone are extremely inadequate. The only obvious keyword is "acquired", and one has to work hard to introduce related words like "Corp" etc. to get the required documents. Research prototypes for answering such kinds of queries are only starting to appear <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b195">196,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">197</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Organization of the Survey</head><p>Given the broad scope of the topic, the diversity of communities involved and the long history, compiling an exhaustive survey on structure extraction is a daunting task. Fortunately, there are many short surveys on information extraction from different communities that can be used to supplement what is missed here <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">104,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">139,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">142,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">153,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">154,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">178,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b208">209,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">212]</ref>.</p><p>We provide a taxonomy of the field by categorizing along different dimensions and alongside scope out what is covered in this survey. We layout the field of information extraction along the following five dimensions. These are discussed in Sections 1.3 through 1.7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Types of Structure Extracted</head><p>We categorize the type of structure extracted from an unstructured source into four types: entities, relationships between entities, adjectives describing entities, and higher-order structures such as tables and lists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.1">Entities</head><p>Entities are typically noun phrases and comprise of one to a few tokens in the unstructured text. The most popular form of entities is named entities like names of persons, locations, and companies as popularized in the MUC <ref type="bibr">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">100]</ref>, ACE <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">159]</ref>, and CoNLL <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[206]</ref> competitions. Named entity recognition was first introduced in the sixth MUC <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[100]</ref> and consisted of three subtasks: proper names and acronyms of persons, locations, and organizations (ENAMEX), absolute temporal terms (TIMEX) and monetary and other numeric expressions (NUMEX). Now the term entities is expanded to also include generics like disease names, protein names, paper titles, and journal names.</p><p>The ACE competition for entity relationship extraction from natural language text lists more than 100 different entity types.   and location entities from news articles; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>.2 shows an example where entity extraction can be treated as a problem of segmenting a text record into structured entities. In this case an address string is segmented so as to identify six structured entities. More examples of segmentation of addresses coming from diverse geographical locations appear in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.1.</p><p>We cover techniques for entity extraction in Sections 2 and 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.2">Relationships</head><p>Relationships are defined over two or more entities related in a predefined way. Examples are "is employee of" relationship between a person and an organization, "is acquired by" relationship between pairs of companies, "location of outbreak" relationship between a disease and a location, and "is price of" relationship between a product name and a currency amount on a web-page. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>.1 shows instances of the extraction of two relationships from a news article. The extraction of relationships differs from the extraction of entities in one significant way. Whereas entities refer to a sequence of words in the source and can be expressed as annotations on the source, relationships are not annotations on a subset of words. Instead they express the associations between two separate text snippets representing the entities. The extraction of multi-way relationships is often referred to as record extraction. A popular subtype of record extraction is event extraction. For example, for an event such as a disease outbreak we extract a multi-way relationship involving the "disease name", "location of the outbreak", "number of people affected", "number of people killed", and "date of outbreak." Some record extraction tasks are trivial because the unstructured string implies a fixed set of relationships. For example, for addresses, the relation "is located in" is implied between an extracted street name and city name.</p><p>In Section 4, we cover techniques for relationship extraction concentrating mostly on binary relationships.</p><p>Another form of multi-way relationship popular in the natural language community is Semantic Role Labeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[124]</ref>, where given a predicate in a sentence, the goal is to identify various semantic arguments of the predicate. For example, given a predicate accept in the sentence "He accepted the manuscript from his dying father with trembling hands" the extraction task is to find the role-sets of the predicate consisting of the "acceptor", "thing accepted", and "accepted-from". We will not cover semantic role labeling in this survey, and refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[124]</ref> to know more about this topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.3">Adjectives Describing Entities</head><p>In many applications we need to associate a given entity with the value of an adjective describing the entity. The value of this adjective typically needs to be derived by combining soft clues spread over many different words around the entity. For example, given an entity type, say restaurants, or music bands, we need to extract parts of a Blog or web-page that presents a critique of entities of such type. Then, we would like to infer if the critique is positive or negative. This is also called opinion extraction and is now a topic of active research interest in many different communities. We will not cover this topic in this survey but instead refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[160]</ref> for a current and exhaustive survey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.4">Structures such as Lists, Tables, and Ontologies</head><p>The scope of extraction systems has now expanded to include the extraction of not such atomic entities and flat records but also richer structures such as tables, lists, and trees from various types of documents. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[109,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">134,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">164]</ref> addresses the identification of tables from documents, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">156]</ref> considers the extraction of elements of a list, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[130]</ref> considers the extraction of ontologies. We will not be able to cover this topic in the survey to contain its scope and volume. On the topic of table extraction there is an extensive research literature spanning many different communities, including the document analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">109,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">134,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b222">222]</ref>, information retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[164]</ref>, web <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">96]</ref>, database <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">165]</ref>, and machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[164,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b215">216]</ref> communities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Types of Unstructured Sources</head><p>We classify the type of unstructured source along two dimensions: the basic unit of granularity on which an extractor is run, and the heterogeneity in style and format across unstructured documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.1">Granularity of Extraction</head><p>Record or Sentences: The most popular form of extraction is from small text snippets that are either unstructured records like addresses, citations and classified ads <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">151,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">163,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">195]</ref> or sentences extracted from a natural language paragraph <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">159,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b205">206]</ref>. In the case of unstructured records, the data can be treated as a set of structured fields concatenated together, possibly with a limited reordering of the fields. Thus, each word is a part of such structured field and during extraction we just need to segment the text at the entity boundaries. In contrast, in sentences there are many words that do not form part of any entity of interest.</p><p>Paragraphs and Documents: Many other extraction tasks make it necessary to consider the context of multiple sentences or an entire document for meaningful extractions. Popular examples include extractions of events from news articles <ref type="bibr">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">100]</ref>, extraction of part number and problem description from emails in help centers, extraction of a structured resume from a word file, extraction of title, location and timing of a talk from talk announcements <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[189]</ref> and the extraction of paper headers and citations from a scientific publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[163]</ref>.</p><p>The techniques proposed in this survey mostly assume the first kind of source. Typically, for extracting information from longer units the main challenge is designing efficient techniques for filtering only the relevant portion of a long document. Currently, this is handled through hand-coded heuristics, so there is nothing specifically to cover in a survey on the handling of longer units.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.2">Heterogeneity of Unstructured Sources</head><p>An important concern that has a huge impact on the complexity and accuracy of an extractor is how much homogeneity is there in the format and style of the unstructured documents. We categorize them as:</p><p>Machine Generated Pages: On the easy end of the spectrum we have highly templatized machine generated pages. A popular source in this space is HTML documents dynamically generated via database backed sites. The extractors for such documents are popularly known as wrappers. These have been extensively studied in many communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b183">184,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">123,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">149,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">156]</ref>, where the main challenge is how to automatically figure out the layout of a page with little or no human input by exploiting mostly the regularity of HTML tags present in the page. In this survey we will not be able to do justice to the extensive literature on web wrapper development.</p><p>Partially Structured Domain Specific Sources: The most studied setting for information extraction is where the input source is from within a well-defined scope, say news articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">159,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b205">206]</ref>, or classified ads <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[151,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">195]</ref>, or citations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">163]</ref>, or resumes. In all these examples, there is an informal style that is roughly followed so that it is possible to develop a decent extraction model given enough labeled data, but there is lot more variety from one input to another than in machine generated pages. Most of the techniques in this survey are for such input sources.</p><p>Open Ended Sources: Recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b191">192]</ref>, there is interest in extracting instances of relationships and entities from open domains such as the web where there is little that can be expected in terms of homogeneity or consistency. In such situations, one important factor is to exploit the redundancy of the extracted information across many different sources. We discuss extractions from such sources in the context of relationship extraction in Section 4.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5">Input Resources for Extraction</head><p>The basic specification of an extraction task includes just the types of structures to be extracted and the unstructured sources from which it should be extracted. In practice, there are several additional input resources that are available to aid the extraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5.1">Structured Databases</head><p>Existing structured databases of known entities and relationships are a valuable resource to improve extraction accuracy. Typically, there are several such databases available during extraction. In many applications unstructured data needs to be integrated with structured databases on an ongoing basis so that at the time of extraction a large database is available. Consider the example of portals like DBLife, Citeseer, and Google Scholar. In addition to their own operational database of extracted publications, they can also exploit external databases such as the ACM digital library or DBLP. Other examples include the use of a sales transactions database and product database for extracting fields like customer id and product name in a customer email; the use of a contact database to extract authoring information from files in a personal information management system; the use of a postal database to identify entities in address records.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5.2">Labeled Unstructured Text</head><p>Many extraction systems are seeded via labeled unstructured text. The collection of labeled unstructured text requires tedious labeling effort. However, this effort is not totally avoidable because even when an extraction system is manually coded, a ground truth is necessary for evaluating its accuracy. A labeled unstructured source is significantly more valuable than a structured database because it provides contextual information about an entity and also because the form in which an entity appears in the unstructured data is often a very noisy form of its occurrence in the database.</p><p>We will discuss how labeled data is used for learning entity extraction models in Sections 2.3 and 3.4 and for relationship extraction in Section 4.1. In Section 4.2, we show how to learn a model using only a structured database and a large corpus of unlabeled corpus. We discuss how structured databases are used in conjunction with labeled data in Sections 2 and 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5.3">Preprocessing Libraries for Unstructured Text</head><p>Many extraction systems crucially depend on preprocessing libraries that enrich it with linguistic or layout information that serve as valuable anchors for structure recognition.</p><p>Natural Language Text: Natural language documents are often analyzed by a deep pipeline of preprocessing libraries, including,</p><p>? Sentence analyzer and tokenizer that identifies the boundaries of sentences in a document and decomposes each sentence into tokens. Tokens are obtained by splitting a sentence along a predefined set of delimiters like spaces, commas, and dots. A token is typically a word or a digit, or a punctuation.</p><p>? Part of speech tagger that assigns to each word a grammatical category coming from a fixed set. The set of tags includes the conventional part of speech such as noun, verb, adjective, adverb, article, conjunct, and pronoun; but is often considerably more detailed to capture many subtypes of the basic types. Examples of well-known tag sets are the Brown tag set which has 179 total tags, and the Penn treebank tag set that has 45 tags <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[137]</ref>. An example of POS tags attached to a sentence appears below:</p><p>The/DT University/NNP of/IN Helsinki/NNP hosts/VBZ ICML/NNP this/DT year/NN</p><p>? Parser that groups words in a sentence into prominent phrase types such as noun phrases, prepositional phrases, and verb phrases. A context free grammar is typically used to identify the structure of a sentence in terms of its constituent phrase types. The output of parsing is a parse tree that groups words into syntactic phrases. An example of a parse tree appears in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.1. Parse trees are useful in entity extraction because typically named entities are noun phrases. In relationship extraction they are useful because they provide valuable linkages between verbs and their arguments as we will see in Section 4.1.</p><p>? Dependency analyzer that identifies the words in a sentence that form arguments of other words in the sentence. For example, in the sentence "Apple is located in Cupertino", the word "Apple" and "Cupertino" are dependent on the word "located". In particular, they respectively form the subject and object argument of the word "located". The output of a dependency analyzer is a graph where the nodes are the words and the directed edges are used to connect a word to words that depend on it. An example of a dependency graph appears in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.2. The edges could be typed to indicate the type of dependency, but even untyped edges are useful for relationship extraction as we will see in Section 4.</p><p>Many of the above preprocessing steps are expensive. The shift is now for selective preprocessing of only parts of the text. Many shallow extractions are possible without subjecting a sentence to the full preprocessing pipeline. Also, some of these preprocessing steps, example parsing, are often erroneous. The extraction system needs to be robust to errors in the preprocessing steps to avoid cascading of errors. This problem is particularly severe on ill-formed sentences of the kind found in emails and speech transcripts. GATE <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref> and UIMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[91]</ref> are two examples of frameworks that provide support for such preprocessing pipelines. Many NLP libraries are also freely available for download such as IBM's Languageware, 5 libraries from the Stanford NLP group, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> and several others listed under the OpenNLP effort. 7</p><p>Formatted Text: For formatted text such as a pdf document and a web-page, there is often a need for understanding the overall structure and layout of the source before entity extraction. Two popular preprocessing steps on formatted documents are, extracting items in a list-like environment and creating hierarchies of rectangular regions comprising logical units of content. Much work exists in this area in the document analysis community <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[139]</ref> and elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">157,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">191]</ref>. We will not discuss these in this survey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.6">Methods of Extraction</head><p>We categorize the method used for information extraction along two dimensions: hand-coded or learning-based and rule-based or statistical.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.6.1">Hand-coded or Learning-based</head><p>A hand-coded system requires human experts to define rules or regular expressions or program snippets for performing the extraction. That person needs to be a domain expert and a programmer, and possess descent linguistic understanding to be able to develop robust extraction rules. In contrast, learning-based systems require manually labeled unstructured examples to train machine learning models of extraction. Even in the learning-based systems, domain expertise is needed in identifying and labeling examples that will be representative of the actual deployment setting. It is also necessary to possess an understanding of machine learning to be able to choose between various model alternatives and also to define features that will be robust on unseen data. The nature of the extraction task and the amount of noise in the unstructured data should be used to decide between a hand-coded and a learning-based system. An interesting commentary that quantitatively and qualitatively compares the two sides can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[127]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.6.2">Rule-based or Statistical</head><p>Rule-based extraction methods are driven by hard predicates, whereas statistical methods make decisions based on a weighted sum of predicate firings. Rule-based methods are easier to interpret and develop, whereas statistical methods are more robust to noise in the unstructured data. Therefore, rule-based systems are more useful in closed domains where human involvement is both essential and available. In open-ended domains like fact extraction from speech transcripts, or opinion extraction from Blogs, the soft logic of statistical methods is more appropriate. We will present both rule-based techniques for entity Full text available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1561/1500000003</p><p>1.7 Output of Extraction Systems 17 extraction in Section 2 and statistical techniques for entity and relationship extraction in Sections 3 and 4, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.7">Output of Extraction Systems</head><p>There are two primary modes in which an extraction system is deployed. First, where the goal is to identify all mentions of the structured information in the unstructured text. Second, where the goal is to populate a database of structured entities. In this case, the end user does not care about the unstructured text after the structured entities are extracted from it. The core extraction techniques remain the same irrespective of the form of the output. Therefore, in the rest of the survey we will assume the first form of output. Only for a few types of open ended extractions where redundancy is used to improve the reliability of extractions stored in a database is the distinction important. We briefly cover this scenario in Sections 4.2 and 5.4.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.8">Challenges</head><p>Large scale deployments of information extraction models raises many challenges of accuracy, performance, maintainability, and usability that we elaborate on next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.8.1">Accuracy</head><p>The foremost challenge facing the research community, in spite of more than two decades of research in the field, is designing models that achieve high accuracy of extraction. We list some of the factors that contribute to the difficulty of achieving high accuracy in extraction tasks.</p><p>Diversity of Clues: The inherent complexity of the recognition task makes it crucial to combine evidence from a diverse set of clues, each of which could individually be very weak. Even the simplest and the most well-explored of tasks, Named Entity recognition, depends on a myriad set of clues including orthographic property of the words, their part of speech, similarity with an existing database of entities, presence of specific signature words and so on. Optimally combining these different modalities of clues presents a nontrivial modeling challenge. This is evidenced by the huge research literature for this task alone over the past two decades. We will encounter many of these in the next three sections of the survey. However, the problem is far from solved for all the different types of extraction tasks that we mentioned in Section 1.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Difficulty of Detecting Missed Extractions:</head><p>The accuracy of extraction comprises of two components: precision, that measures the percent of extracted entries that are correct, and recall, that measures the percent of actual entities that were extracted correctly. In many cases, precision is high because it is easy to manually detect mistakes in extractions and then tune the models until those mistakes disappear. The bigger challenge is achieving high recall, because without extensive labeled data it is not even possible to detect what was missed in the large mass of unstructured information.</p><p>Increased Complexity of the Structures Extracted : New tasks requiring the extraction of increasingly complex kinds of entities keep getting defined. Of the recent additions, it is not entirely clear how to extract longer entities such as the parts within running text of a Blog where a restaurant is mentioned and critiqued. One of the challenges in such tasks is that the boundary of the entity is not clearly defined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.8.2">Running Time</head><p>Real-life deployment of extraction techniques in the context of an operational system raises many practical performance challenges. These arise at many different levels. First, we need mechanisms to efficiently filter the right subset of documents that are likely to contain the structured information of interest. Second, we need to find means of efficiently zooming into the (typically small) portion of the document that contains the relevant information. Finally, we need to worry about the many expensive processing steps that the selected portion might need to go through. For example, while existing database of structured entries are invaluable for information extraction, they also raise performance challenges. The order in which we search for parts of a compound entity or relationship can have a big influence on running time. These and other performance issues are discussed in Section 5.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.8.3">Other Systems Issues</head><p>Dynamically Changing Sources: Extraction models take time and effort to build and tune to specific unstructured sources. When these sources change, a challenge to any system that operates continuously on that source is detecting the change and adapting the model automatically to the change. We elaborate on this topic in Section 5.2.</p><p>Data Integration: Although in this survey we will concentrate primarily on information extraction, extraction goes hand in hand with the integration of the extracted information with pre-existing datasets and with information already extracted. Many researchers have also attempted to jointly solve the extraction and integration problem with the hope that it will provide higher accuracy than performing each of these steps directly. We elaborate further in Section 5.3.</p><p>Extraction Errors: It is impossible to guarantee perfect extraction accuracy in real-life deployment settings even with the latest extraction tools. The problem is more severe when the sources are extremely heterogeneous, making it impossible to hand tune any extraction tool to perfection. One method of surmounting the problem of extraction errors is to require that each extracted entity be attached with confidence scores that correlate with the probability that the extracted entities are correct. Normally, even this is a hard goal to achieve. Another challenging issue is how to represent such results in a database that captures the imprecision of extraction, while being easy to store and query. In Section 5.4, we review techniques for managing errors that arise in the extraction process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Section Layout</head><p>The rest of the survey is organized as follows. In Section 2, we cover rule-based techniques for entity extraction. In Section 3, we present an overview of statistical methods for entity extraction. In Section 4, we cover statistical and rule-based techniques for relationship extraction. In Section 5, we discuss work on handling various performance and systems issues associated with creating an operational extraction system.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Foundations and Trends R in Databases, 2007, Volume 1, 4 issues.
