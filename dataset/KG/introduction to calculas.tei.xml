				<p>The regular solids or regular polyhedra are solid geometric figures with the same identical regular polygon on each face. There are only five regular solids discovered by the ancient Greek mathematicians. These five solids are the following. the tetrahedron (4 faces) the cube or hexadron (6 faces) the octahedron (8 faces) the dodecahedron (12 faces) the icosahedron (20 faces) Each figure follows the Euler formula Number of faces + Number of vertices = Number of edges + 2</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preface</head><p>This is the first volume of an introductory calculus presentation intended for future scientists and engineers. Volume I contains five chapters emphasizing fundamental concepts from calculus and analytic geometry and the application of these concepts to selected areas of science and engineering. Chapter one is a review of fundamental background material needed for the development of differential and integral calculus together with an introduction to limits. Chapter two introduces the differential calculus and develops differentiation formulas and rules for finding the derivatives associated with a variety of basic functions. Chapter three introduces the integral calculus and develops indefinite and definite integrals. Rules for integration and the construction of integral tables are developed throughout the chapter. Chapter four is an investigation of sequences and numerical sums and how these quantities are related to the functions, derivatives and integrals of the previous chapters. Chapter five investigates many selected applications of the differential and integral calculus. The selected applications come mainly from the areas of economics, physics, biology, chemistry and engineering.</p><p>The main purpose of these two volumes is to (i) Provide an introduction to calculus in its many forms (ii) Give some presentations to illustrate how powerful calculus is as a mathematical tool for solving a variety of scientific problems, (iii) Present numerous examples to show how calculus can be extended to other mathematical areas, (iv) Provide material detailed enough so that two volumes of basic material can be used as reference books, (v) Introduce concepts from a variety of application areas, such as biology, chemistry, economics, physics and engineering, to demonstrate applications of calculus (vi) Emphasize that definitions are extremely important in the study of any mathematical subject (vii) Introduce proofs of important results as an aid to the development of analytical and critical reasoning skills (viii) Introduce mathematical terminology and symbols which can be used to help model physical systems and (ix) Illustrate multiple approaches to various calculus subjects.</p><p>If the main thrust of an introductory calculus course is the application of calculus to solve problems, then a student must quickly get to a point where he or she understands enough fundamentals so that calculus can be used as a tool for solving the problems of interest. If on the other hand a deeper understanding of calculus is required in order to develop the basics for more advanced mathematical iii efforts, then students need to be exposed to theorems and proofs. If the calculus course leans toward more applications, rather than theory, then the proofs presented throughout the text can be skimmed over. However, if the calculus course is for mathematics majors, then one would want to be sure to go into the proofs in greater detail, because these proofs are laying the groundwork and providing background material for the study of more advanced concepts.</p><p>If you are a beginner in calculus, then be sure that you have had the appropriate background material of algebra and trigonometry. If you don't understand something then don't be afraid to ask your instructor a question. Go to the library and check out some other calculus books to get a presentation of the subject from a different perspective. The internet is a place where one can find numerous help aids for calculus. Also on the internet one can find many illustrations of the applications of calculus. These additional study aids will show you that there are multiple approaches to various calculus subjects and should help you with the development of your analytical and reasoning skills. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sets, Functions, Graphs and Limits</head><p>The study of different types of functions, limits associated with these functions and how these functions change, together with the ability to graphically illustrate basic concepts associated with these functions, is fundamental to the understanding of calculus. These important issues are presented along with the development of some additional elementary concepts which will aid in our later studies of more advanced concepts. In this chapter and throughout this text be aware that definitions and their consequences are the keys to success for the understanding of calculus and its many applications and extensions. Note that appendix B contains a summary of fundamentals from algebra and trigonometry which is a prerequisite for the study of calculus. This first chapter is a preliminary to calculus and begins by introducing the concepts of a function, graph of a function and limits associated with functions. These concepts are introduced using some basic elements from the theory of sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elementary Set Theory</head><p>A set can be any collection of objects. A set of objects can be represented using the notation S = { x | statement about x} and is read,"S is the set of objects x which make the statement about x true ". Alternatively, a finite number of objects within S can be denoted by listing the objects and writing S = {S 1 , S 2 , . . . , S n } For example, the notation</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S = { x | x ? 4 &gt; 0}</formula><p>can be used to denote the set of points x which are greater than 4 and the notation T = {A, B, C, D, E} can be used to represent a set containing the first 5 letters of the alphabet.</p><p>A set with no elements is denoted by the symbol ? and is known as the empty set. The elements within a set are usually selected from some universal set U associated with the elements x belonging to the set. When dealing with real numbers the universal set U is understood to be the set of all real numbers. The universal set is usually defined beforehand or is implied within the context of how the set is being used. For example, the universal set associated with the set T above could be the set of all symbols if that is appropriate and within the context of how the set T is being used.</p><p>The symbol ¡Ê is read "belongs to " or "is a member of " and the symbol /</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4</head><p>The difference 1 between two sets A and B is written A ? B and defined</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A ? B = { x | x ¡Ê A and x / ¡Ê B }</formula><p>The equality of two sets is written A = B and defined A = B if and only if A ? B and B ? A That is, if A ? B and B ? A, then the sets A and B must have the same elements which implies equality. Conversely, if two sets are equal A = B, then A ? B and B ? A since every set is a subset of itself.  A cartesian or rectangular coordinate system is constructed by selecting two straight lines intersecting at right angles and labeling the point of intersection as the origin of the coordinate system and then labeling the horizontal line as the x-axis and the vertical line as the y-axis. On these axes some kind of a scale is constructed with positive numbers to the right on the horizontal axis and upward on the vertical axes. For example, by constructing lines at equally spaced distances along the axes one can create a grid of intersecting lines.</p><p>A point in the plane defined by the two axes can then be represented by a number pair <ref type="bibr">(x, y)</ref>. In rectangular coordinates a number pair <ref type="bibr">(x, y)</ref> is said to have the abscissa x and the ordinate y. The point <ref type="bibr">(x, y)</ref> is located a distance r = x 2 + y 2 from the origin with x representing distance of the point from the y-axis and y representing the distance of the point from the x-axis. The x axis or abscissa axis and the y axis or ordinate axis divides the plane into four quadrants labeled I, II, III and IV .</p><p>To construct a polar coordinate system one selects an origin for the polar coordinates and labels it 0. Next construct a half-line similar to the x-axis of the rectangular coordinates. This half-line is called the polar axis or initial ray and the origin is called the pole of the polar coordinate system. By placing another line on top of the polar axis and rotating this line about the pole through a positive angle ¦È, measured in radians, one can create a ray emanating from the origin at an angle ¦È as illustrated in the figure 1-3. In polar coordinates the rays are illustrated emanating from the origin at equally spaced angular distances around the origin and then concentric circles are constructed representing constant distances from the origin.</p><p>A point in polar coordinates is then denoted by the number pair <ref type="bibr">(r, ¦È)</ref> where ¦È is the angle of rotation associated with the ray and r is a distance outward from the origin along the ray. The polar origin or pole has the coordinates <ref type="bibr">(0, ¦È)</ref> for any angle ¦È. All points having the polar coordinates (¦Ñ, 0), with ¦Ñ ¡Ý 0, lie on the polar axis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1-3. Construction of polar axes</head><p>Here angle rotations are treated the same as in trigonometry with a counterclockwise rotation being in the positive direction and a clockwise rotation being in the negative direction. Note that the polar representation of a point is not unique since the angle ¦È can be increased or decreased by some multiple of 2¦Ð to arrive at the same point. That is, (r, ¦È) = (r, ¦È ¡À 2n¦Ð) where n is an integer.</p><p>Also note that a ray at angle ¦È can be extended to represent negative distances along the ray. Points (?r, ¦È) can also be represented by the number pair (r, ¦È + ¦Ð). Alternatively, one can think of a rectangular point <ref type="bibr">(x, y)</ref> and the corresponding polar point <ref type="bibr">(r, ¦È)</ref> as being related by the equations An example of a rectangular coordinate system and polar coordinate system are illustrated in the figure 1-2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distance Between Two Points in the Plane</head><p>If two points are given in polar coordinates as (r 1 , ¦È 1 ) and (r 2 , ¦È 2 ), as illustrated in the figure 1-4, then one can use the law of cosines to calculate the distance d between the points since   Alternatively, let (x 1 , y 1 ) and (x 2 , y 2 ) denote two points which are plotted on a cartesian set of axes as illustrated in the figure 1-5. The Greek letter ? (delta) is used to denote a change in a quantity. For example, in moving from the point (x 1 , y 1 ) to the point (x 2 , y 2 ) the change in x is denoted ?x = x 2 ? x 1 and the change in y is denoted ?y = y 2 ? y 1 . These changes can be thought of as the legs of a right-triangle as illustrated in the figure 1-5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1-5.</head><p>Using a right-triangle to calculate distance between two points in rectangular coordinates.</p><p>The figure 1-5 illustrates that by using the Pythagorean theorem the distance d between the two points can be determined from the equations </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graphs and Functions</head><p>Let X and Y denote sets which contain some subset of the real numbers with elements x ¡Ê X and y ¡Ê Y . If a rule or relation f is given such that for each x ¡Ê X there corresponds exactly one real number y ¡Ê Y , then y is said to be a real singlevalued function of x and the relation between y and x is denoted y = f (x) and read as "y is a function of x ". If for each x ¡Ê X, there is only one ordered pair <ref type="bibr">(x, y)</ref>, then a functional relation from X to Y is said to exist. The function is called singlevalued if no two different ordered pairs <ref type="bibr">(x, y)</ref> have the same first element. A way of representing the set of ordered pairs which define a function is to use one of the notations { (x, y) | y = f (x), x ¡Ê X } or { (x, f (x)) | x ¡Ê X } (1.  The set of values x ¡Ê X is called t ? he domain of definition of the function f (x). The set of values {y | y = f (x) , x ¡Ê X} is called the range of the function or the image of the set X under the mapping or transformation given by f. The set of ordered pairs C = { (x, y) | y = f (x), x ¡Ê X} is called the graph of the function and represents a curve in the x, y-plane giving a pictorial representation of the function. If y = f (x) for x ¡Ê X, the number x is called the independent variable or argument of the function and the image value y is called the dependent variable of the function. It is to be understood that the domain of definition of a function contains real values for x for which the relation f (x) is also real-valued. In many physical problems, the domain of definition X must be restricted in order that a given physical problem be well defined. For example, in order that ¡Ì x ? 1 be real-valued, x must be restricted to be greater than or equal to 1.</p><p>When representing many different functions the symbol f can be replaced by any of the letters from the alphabet. For example, one might have several different functions labeled as y = f (x), y = g(x), y = h(x), . . . , y = y(x), . . . , y = z(x) <ref type="bibr">(1.5)</ref> or one could add subscripts to the letter f to denote a set of n-different functions Let y = f (x) = x 2 + x for x ¡Ê R be a given rule defining a function which can be represented by a curve in the cartesian x, y-plane. The variable x is a dummy variable used to define the function rule. Substituting the value 3 in place of x in the function rule gives y = f (3) = 3 2 + 3 = 12 which represents the height of the curve at x = 3. In general, for any given value of x the quantity y = f (x) represents the height of the curve at the point x. By assigning a collection of ordered values to x and calculating the corresponding value y = f (x), using the given rule, one collects a set of <ref type="bibr">(x, y)</ref> pairs which can be interpreted as representing a set of points in the cartesian coordinate system. The set of all points corresponding to a given rule is called the locus of points satisfying the rule. The graph illustrated in the figure 1-6 is a pictorial representation of the given rule.  If f (x) represents the height of the curve at the point x, then f (x + h) represents the height of the curve at x + h.</p><p>(b) Let r = f (¦È) = 1 + ¦È for 0 ¡Ü ¦È ¡Ü 2¦Ð be a given rule defining a function which can be represented by a curve in polar coordinates <ref type="bibr">(r, ¦È)</ref>. One can select a set of ordered values for ¦È in the interval <ref type="bibr">[0, 2¦Ð]</ref> and calculate the corresponding values for r = f (¦È). The set of points (r, ¦È) created can then be plotted on polar graph paper to give a pictorial representation of the function rule. The graph illustrated in the figure 1-7 is a pictorial representation of the given function over the given domain. Note in dealing with polar coordinates a radial distance r and polar angle ¦È can have any of the representations <ref type="bibr">( (?1)</ref> n r, ¦È + n ¦Ð) and consequently a functional relation like r = f (¦È) can be represented by one of the alternative equations r = (?1) n f (¦È + n¦Ð) The absolute value function is defined</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">¦È</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">y = f (x) =| x |= x, x ¡Ý 0 ?x, x ¡Ü 0</formula><p>Substituting in a couple of specific values for x one can form a set of (x, y) number pairs and then sketch a graph of the function, which represents a pictorial image of the functional relationship between x and y.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(d) Functions defined in a piecewise fashion.</head><p>A function defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">1 + x, x ¡Ü ?1 f (x) = ? ? ? ? ? x ¡Ê R ? ? ? ? 1 ? x, ?1 ¡Ü x ¡Ü 0 x 2 , 0 ¡Ü x ¡Ü 2 2 + x, x &gt; 2</formula><p>is a collection of rules which defines the function in a piecewise fashion. One must examine values of the input x to determine which portion of the rule is to be used in evaluating the function. The above example illustrates a function having jump discontinuities at the points where x = ?1 and x = 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(e) Numerical data.</head><p>If one collects numerical data from an experiment such as recording temperature</p><p>T at different times t, then one obtains a set of data points called number pairs. If these number pairs are labeled (t i , T i ), for i = 1, 2, . . ., n, one obtains a table of values such as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Time t t 1 t 2 ¡¤ ¡¤ ¡¤ t n Temperature T T 1 T 2 ¡¤ ¡¤ ¡¤ T n</formula><p>It is then possible to plot a t, T -axes graph associated with these data points by plotting the points and then drawing a smooth curve through the points or by connecting the points with straight line segments. In doing this, one is assuming that the curve sketched is a graphical representation of an unknown functional relationship between the variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(e) Other representation of functions</head><p>Functions can be represented by different methods such as using equations, graphs, tables of values, a verbal rule, or by using a machine like a pocket calculator which is programmable to give some output for a given input. Functions can be continuous or they can have discontinuities. Continuous functions are recognized by their graphs which are smooth unbroken curves with continuously turning tangent lines at each point on the curve. Discontinuities usually occur when functional values or tangent lines are not well defined at a point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Increasing and Decreasing Functions</head><p>One aspect in the study of calculus is to examine how functions change over an interval. A function is said to be increasing over an interval <ref type="bibr">(a, b)</ref> if for every pair of points (x 0 , x 1 ) within the interval (a, b), satisfying x 0 &lt; x 1 , the height of the curve at x 0 is less than the height of the curve at x 1 or f (x 0 ) &lt; f (x 1 ). A function is called c 1 = c 2 = ¡¤ ¡¤ ¡¤ = c n = 0, then the set of functions {f 1 , f 2 , . . . , f n } is called a linearly independent set of functions. Note that if the set of functions are linearly dependent, then one of the functions can be made to become a linear combination of the other functions. For example, assume that c 1 = 0 in equation (1.9). One can then write</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f 1 (x) = ? c 2 c 1 f 2 (x) ? ¡¤ ¡¤ ¡¤ ? c n c 1 f n (x)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>14</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single-valued Functions</head><p>Consider plane curves represented in rectangular coordinates such as the curves illustrated in the figures 1-8. These curves can be considered as a set of ordered pairs <ref type="bibr">(x, y)</ref> where the x and y values satisfy some specified condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1-8. Selected curves sketched in rectangular coordinates</head><p>In terms of a set representation, these curves can be described using the set notation C = { (x, y) | relationship satisfied by x and y with x ¡Ê X } This represents a collection of points <ref type="bibr">(x, y)</ref>, where x is restricted to values from some set X and y is related to x in some fashion. A graph of the function results when the points of the set are plotted in rectangular coordinates. If for all values x 0 a vertical line x = x 0 cuts the graph of the function in only a single point, then the function is called single-valued. If the vertical line intersects the graph of the function in more than one point, then the function is called multiple-valued.</p><p>Similarly, in polar coordinates, a graph of the function is a curve which can be represented by a collection of ordered pairs <ref type="bibr">(r, ¦È)</ref>. For example, C = { (r, ¦È) | relationship satisfied by r and ¦È with ¦È ¡Ê ¦¨ } where ¦¨ is some specified domain of definition of the function. There are available many plotting programs for the computer which produce a variety of specialized graphs. Some computer programs produce not only cartesian plots and polar plots, but also many other specialized graph types needed for various science and engineering applications. These other graph types give an alternative way of representing functional relationships between variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 1-4. Rectangular and Polar Graphs</head><p>Plotting the same function in both rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates gives different shaped curves and so the graphs of these functions have different properties depending upon the coordinate system used to represent the function. For example, plot the function y = f (x) = x 2 for ?2 ¡Ü x ¡Ü 2 in rectangular coordinates and then plot the function r = g(¦È) = ¦È 2 for 0 ¡Ü ¦È ¡Ü 2¦Ð in polar coordinates. Show that one curve is a parabola and the other curve is a spiral. 3.0625 -1.50</p><p>2.2500 -1.25</p><p>1.5625 -1.00</p><p>1  Select some points x from the domain of the function and calculate the image points under the mapping y = f (x) = x 2 . For example, one can use a spread sheet and put values of x in one column and the image values y in an adjacent column to obtain a table of values for representing the function at a discrete set of selected points.</p><p>Similarly, select some points ¦È from the domain of the function to be plotted in polar coordinates and calculate the image points under the mapping r = g(¦È) = ¦È 2 . Use a spread sheet and put values of ¦È in one column and the image values r in an adjacent column to obtain a table for representing the function as a discrete set of selected points. Using an x spacing of 0.25 between points for the rectangular graph and a ¦È spacing of ¦Ð/4 for the polar graph, one can verify the table of values and graphs given in the figure 1-9.</p><p>Some well known cartesian curves are illustrated in the following figures. Some well known polar curves are illustrated in the following figures.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parametric Representation of Curve</head><p>Examine the graph in figure 1-8(b) and observe that it does not represent a single-valued function y = f (x). Also the circle in figure 1-8(c) does not define a single valued function. An alternative way of graphing a function is to represent it in a parametric form. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> In general, a graphical representation of a function or a section of a function, be it single-valued or multiple-valued, can be defined by a parametric representation C = {(x, y) | x = x(t), y = y(t), a ¡Ü t ¡Ü b} <ref type="bibr">(1.10)</ref> where both x(t) and y(t) are single-valued functions of the parameter t. The relationship between x and y is obtained by eliminating the parameter t from the representation x = x(t) and y = y(t). For example, the parametric representation x = x(t) = t and y = y(t) = t 2 , for t ¡Ê R, is one parametric representation of the parabola y = x 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Equation of a Circle</head><p>A circle of radius ¦Ñ and centered at the point <ref type="bibr">(h, k)</ref> is illustrated in the figure 1-14 and is defined as the set of all points <ref type="bibr">(x, y)</ref> whose distance from the point <ref type="bibr">(h, k)</ref> has the constant value of ¦Ñ. Using the distance formula (1.3), with (x 1 , y 1 ) replaced by <ref type="bibr">(h, k)</ref>, the point (x 2 , y 2 ) replaced by the variable point <ref type="bibr">(x, y)</ref> and replacing d by ¦Ñ, one can show the equation of the circle is given by one of the formulas  can be converted to the form of equation (1.11) by completing the square on the x and y terms. This is accomplished by taking 1/2 of the x-coefficient, squaring and adding the result to both sides of equation (1.12) and then taking 1/2 of the y-coefficient, squaring and adding the result to both sides of equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_206">(1.</ref>  This is called a parametric representation of the circle in terms of a parameter ¦È.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Equations of the form</head><p>The equation of a circle in polar form can be constructed as follows. Let (r, ¦È) denote a variable point which moves along the circumference of a circle of radius ¦Ñ which is centered at the point (r 1 , ¦È 1 ) as illustrated in the figure 1-15. Using the distances r, r 1 and ¦Ñ, one can employ the law of cosines to express the polar form of the equation of a circle as Functions can be represented in a variety of ways. Sometimes functions are represented in the implicit form G(x, y) = 0, because it is not always possible to solve for one variable explicitly in terms of another. In those cases where it is possible to solve for one variable in terms of another to obtain y = f (x) or x = g(y), the function is said to be represented in an explicit form.</p><p>For example, the circle of radius ¦Ñ can be represented by any of the relations G(x, y) = x 2 + y 2 ? ¦Ñ 2 = 0, </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">y</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Types of functions</head><p>One can define a functional relationships between the two variables x and y in different ways.</p><p>A polynomial function in the variable x has the form y = p n (x) = a 0 x n + a 1 x n?1 + a 2 x n?2 + ¡¤ ¡¤ ¡¤ + a n?1 x + a n ( <ref type="bibr">1.16)</ref> where a 0 , a 1 , . . . , a n represent constants with a 0 = 0 and n is a positive integer. The integer n is called the degree of the polynomial function. The fundamental theorem of algebra states that a polynomial of degree n has n-roots. That is, the polynomial equation p n (x) = 0 has n-solutions called the roots of the polynomial equation. If these roots are denoted by x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n , then the polynomial can also be represented in the form p n (x) = a 0 (x ? x 1 )(x ? x 2 ) ¡¤ ¡¤ ¡¤ (x ? x n )</p><p>If x i is a number, real or complex, which satisfies p n (x i ) = 0, then (x ? x i ) is a factor of the polynomial function p n (x). Complex roots of a polynomial function must always occur in conjugate pairs and one can say that if ¦Á + i ¦Â is a root of p n (x) = 0, then ¦Á ? i ¦Â is also a root. Real roots x i of a polynomial function give rise to linear factors (x ? x i ), while complex roots of a polynomial function give rise to quadratic factors of the form where both P (x) and Q(x) are polynomial functions in x and Q(x) = 0. If y = f (x) is a root of an equation of the form b 0 (x)y n + b 1 (x)y n?1 + b 2 (x)y n?2 + ¡¤ ¡¤ ¡¤ + b n?1 (x)y + b n (x) = 0 ( <ref type="bibr">1.18)</ref> where b 0 (x), b 1 (x), . . . , b n (x) are polynomial functions of x and n is a positive integer, then y = f (x) is called an algebraic function.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Symmetry of Functions</head><p>The expression y = f (x) is the representation of a function in an explicit form where one variable is expressed in terms of a second variable. The set of values given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">S = {(x, y) | y = f (x), x ¡Ê X}</formula><p>where X is the domain of the function, represents a graph of the function. The notation f (x), read "f of x ", has the physical interpretation of representing y which is the height of the curve at the point x. Given a function y = f (x), one can replace x by any other argument. For example, if f (x) is a periodic function with least period T , one can write f (x) = f (x + T ) for all values of x. One can interpret the equation f (x) = f (x + T ) for all values of x as stating that the height of the curve at any point x is the same as the height of the curve at the point x + T . As another example, if the notation y = f (x) represents the height of the curve at the point x, then y + ?y = f (x + ?x) would represent the height of the given curve at the point x + ?x and ?y = f (x + ?x) ? f (x) would represent the change in the height of the curve y in moving from the point x to the point x + ?x. If the argument x of the function is replaced by ?x, then one can compare the height of the curve at the points x and ?x. If f (x) = f (?x) for all values of x, then the height of the curve at x equals the height of the curve at ?x and when this happens the function f (x) is called an even function of x and one can state that f (x) is a symmetric function about the y-axis. If f (x) = ?f <ref type="bibr">(?x)</ref> for all values of x, then the height of the curve at x equals the negative of the height of the curve at ?x and in this case the function f (x) is called an odd function of x and one can state that the function f (x) is symmetric about the origin. By interchanging the roles of x and y and shifting or rotation of axes, other symmetries can be discovered. The figure 1-18 and 1-19 illustrates some examples of symmetric functions. Symmetry about a point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1-19. Examples of symmetric functions</head><p>In general, two points P 1 and P 2 are said to be symmetric to a line if the line is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining the two points. In a similar fashion a graph is said to symmetric to a line if all points of the graph can be grouped into pairs which are symmetric to the line and then the line is called the axis of symmetry of the graph. A point of symmetry occurs if all points on the graph can be grouped into pairs so that all the line segments joining the pairs are then bisected by the same point. See for example the figure 1-19. For example, one can say that a curve is symmetric with respect to the x-axis if for each point <ref type="bibr">(x, y)</ref> on the curve, the point <ref type="bibr">(x, ?y)</ref> is also on the curve. A curve is symmetric with respect to the y-axis if for each point <ref type="bibr">(x, y)</ref> on the curve, the point <ref type="bibr">(?x, y)</ref> is also on the curve. A curve is said to be symmetric about the origin if for each point <ref type="bibr">(x, y)</ref> on the curve, then the point <ref type="bibr">(?x, ?y)</ref> is also on the curve. Example 1-5. A polynomial function p n (x) = a 0 x n + a 1 x n?1 + ¡¤ ¡¤ ¡¤ + a n?1 x + a n of degree n has the following properties. (i) If only even powers of x occur in p n (x), then the polynomial curve is symmetric about the y-axis, because in this case p n (?x) = p n (x). (ii) If only odd powers of x occur in p n (x), then the polynomial curve is symmetric about the origin, because in this case p n (?x) = ?p n (x). (iii) If there are points x = a and x = c such that p n (a) and p n (c) have opposite signs, then there exists at least one point x = b satisfying a &lt; b &lt; c, such that p n (b) = 0. This is because polynomial functions are continuous functions and they must change continuously from the value p n (a) to the value p n (c) and so must pass, at least once, through the value zero.</p></div>

An arbitrary point (x, y), a distance r from the origin, has the coordinates (? x, ? y) when referenced to the (? x, ? y) coordinate system. Using basic trigonometry one can find the relationship between the rotated and unrotated axes. Examine the figure 1-22 and verify the following trigonometric relationships. The projection of r onto the ? x axis produces ? x = r cos ¦Õ and the projection of r onto the ? y axis produces ? y = r sin ¦Õ.

One-to-one functions are such that if x 1 = x 2 , then f (x 1 ) = f (x 2 ). One can test to determine if a function is a one-to-one function by using the horizontal line test which is as follows. If there exists a horizontal line y = a constant, which intersects the graph of y = f (x) in more than one point, then there will exist numbers x 1 and x 2 such that the height of the curve at x 1 is the same as the height of the curve at x 2 or f (x 1 ) = f (x 2 ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formal Definition of Limit</head><p>In the early development of mathematics the concept of a limit was very vague. The calculation of a limit was so fundamental to understanding certain aspects of calculus, that it required a precise definition. A more formal ?¦Ä (read epsilon-delta) definition of a limit was finally developed around the 1800's. This formalization resulted from the combined research into limits developed by the mathematicians Weierstrass,</p><p>3 Bolzano 4 and Cauchy.</p></div>

The real number ¦Ä which is selected to achieve the smallness specified by , is not a unique number. Once one value of ¦Ä is found, then any other value ¦Ä 1 &lt; ¦Ä would also satisfy the definition.

All curves which have the form of equation (1.64) can be obtained by cutting a right circular cone with a plane. The figure 1-36(a) illustrates a right circular cone obtained by constructing a circle in a horizontal plane and then moving perpendicular to the plane to a point V above or below the center of the circle. The point V is called the vertex of the cone. All the lines through the point V and points on the circumference of the circle are called generators of the cone. The set of all generators produces a right circular cone. The figure 1-36(b) illustrates a horizontal plane intersecting the cone in a circle. The <ref type="figure" target="#fig_72">figure 1</ref>-36(c) illustrates a nonhorizontal plane section which cuts two opposite generators. The resulting curve of intersection is called an ellipse. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_72">Figure 1</ref>-36(d) illustrates a plane parallel to a generator of the cone which also intersects the cone. The resulting curve of intersection is called a parabola. Any plane cutting both the upper and lower parts of a cone will intersect the cone in a curve called a hyperbola which is illustrated in the figure 1-36(e). Conic sections were studied by the early Greeks. Euclid 7 supposedly wrote four books on conic sections. The Greek geometer Appollonius 8 wrote eight books on conic sections which summarized Greek knowledge of conic sections and his work has survived the passage of time.</p><p>Conic sections can be defined as follows. In the xy-plane select a point f , called the focus, and a line D not through f . This line is called the directrix. The set of points P satisfying the condition that the distance from f to P , call it r = P f , is some multiple e times the distance d = P P , where d represents the perpendicular distance from the point P to the line D. The resulting equation for the conic section is obtained from the equation r = e d with the geometric interpretation of this equation illustrated in the figure 1-37.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differential Calculus</head><p>The history of mathematics presents the development of calculus as being accredited to Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) an English physicist, mathematician and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz (1646-1716) a German physicist, mathematician. Portraits of these famous individuals are given in the figure 2-1. The introduction of calculus created an explosion in the development of the physical sciences and other areas of science as calculus provided a way of describing natural and physical laws in a mathematical format which is easily understood. The development of calculus also opened new areas of mathematics and science as individuals sought out new ways to apply the techniques of calculus. Calculus is the study of things that change and finding ways to represent these changes in a mathematical way. The symbol ? will be used to represent change. For example, the notation ?y is to be read "The change in y ".</p></div>

One can construct a tangent line to any point P on the curve as follows. On the curve y = f (x) consider two neighboring points P and Q with coordinates <ref type="bibr">(x, f (x))</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(x + ?x, f (x + ?x)</ref>), as illustrated in the figure 2-2. In this figure ?x represents some small change in x and ?y = f (x + ?x) ? f (x) denotes the change in y in moving from point P to Q. In the figure 2-2, the near points P and Q on the curve define a straight line called a secant line of the curve. In the limit as the point Q approaches the point P the quantity ?x tends toward zero and the secant line approaches the tangent line. The quantity ?y also tends toward zero while the slope of the secant line m s approaches the slope of the tangent line m t to the curve at the point P .</p><p>The slope of the secant line m s is given by m s = ?y ?x and the slope of the tangent line m t at the point P with coordinates <ref type="bibr">(x, f (x)</ref>) is given by the derived function f if this limit exists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>87</head><p>The Derivative of y = f (x)</p><p>The secant line through the near points P and Q approaches the tangent line in the limit as ?x tends toward zero. The slope of the secant line represents the slope of the tangent line m t at the point P and is obtained from equation (2.1) as a limiting process. The derived function f (x) is called the derivative of y = f (x) with respect to x and represents the slope of the curve y = f (x) at the point (x, f (x)). It also represents the instantaneous rate of change of y = f (x) with respect to x at the point (x, f (x)) on the curve y = f (x). The derived function f (x) or derivative represents the slope m t of the tangent line constructed through the point <ref type="bibr">(x, f (x)</ref>) on the curve. The limit, defined by the equation (2.1), represents a process, called differentiation, for finding the derivative</p><formula xml:id="formula_155">dy dx = f (x).

Note also that there are times where the implicit functions F (x, y) = 0 cannot be converted into an explicit form.

Critical points must then be tested to see if they correspond to a local maximum, local minimum or neither, such as the point x 7 in figure 2-12. (4) Continuous curves which have abrupt changes in their derivative at a single point are said to have cusps at these points. For example, the points where x = x 1 and x = x 2 in the figure 2-12 are called cusps. At these cusps one finds that either f (x) = ¡À¡Þ or f (x) has a jump discontinuity. These points must be tested separately to determine if they correspond to local maximum or minimum values for y = f (x). is not zero everywhere, at least one maximum or one minimum value must exist. One can also say that between two maximum values there is at least one minimum value or between two minimum values there is at least one maximum value. (8) In the neighborhood of a local maximum value, as x increases the function increases, then stops changing and starts to decrease. Similarly, in the neighborhood of a local minimum value, as x increases the function decreases, then stops changing and starts to increase. In terms of a particle moving along the curve, one can say that the particle change becomes stationary at a local maximum or minimum value of the function. The terminology of finding stationary values of a function is often used when referring to maximum and minimum problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First Derivative Test</head><p>The first derivative test for extreme values of a function tests the slope of the curve at near points on either side of a critical point. That is, to test a given function y = f (x) for maximum and minimum values, one first calculates the derivative function f (x) and then solves the equation f (x) = 0 to find the critical points. If x 0 is a root of the equation f (x) = 0, then f (x 0 ) = 0 and then one must examine how f (x) changes as x moves from left to right across the point x 0 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Slope Changes in Neighborhood of Critical Point</head><p>If the slope f (x) changes from (i) + to 0 to ?, then a local maximum occurs at the critical point.</p><p>(ii) ? to 0 to +, then a local minimum occurs at the critical point. (iii) + to 0 to +, then a point of inflection is said to exist at the critical point. (iv) ? to 0 to ?, then a point of inflection is said to exist at the critical point. Given a curve y = f (x) for x ¡Ê <ref type="bibr">[a, b]</ref>, the values of f (x) at the end points where x = a and x = b must be tested separately to determine if they represents relative or absolute extreme values for the function. Also points where the slope of the curve changes abruptly, such as the point where x = x 1 in figure 2-12, must also be tested separately for local extreme values of the function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Second Derivative Test</head><p>The second derivative test for extreme values of a function y = f (x) assumes that the second derivative f (x) is continuous in the neighborhood of a critical point. One can then say in the neighborhood of a local minimum value the curve will be concave upward and in the neighborhood of a local maximum value the concavity of the curve will be downward. This gives the following second derivative test for local maximum and minimum values.</p><p>(i) If f (x 0 ) = 0 and f (x 0 ) &gt; 0, then f has relative minimum value at x 0 .</p><p>(ii) If f (x 0 ) = 0 and f (x 0 ) &lt; 0, then f has a relative maximum value at x 0 .</p><p>If f (x 0 ) = 0, then the second derivative test fails and one must use the first derivative test. The second derivative test is often used because it is convenient. The second derivative test is not as general as the first derivative test.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Solution</head><p>Let x denote the base of the rectangle and y the height of the rectangle, then the area of the rectangle to be maximized is given by A = xy. This expresses the area as a function of two variables. If y can be related to x, then the area can be expressed in terms of a single variable and the area can be differentiated. In this way one can apply the previous max-min methods for analyzing this problem. To begin, observe that the triangles ABC and ADE are similar triangles so one can write</p><formula xml:id="formula_306">h ? y h = x b or x = b h ? y h or y = h ? h b x</formula><p>This gives a relationship between the values of x and y. Note that as y varies from y = 0 to the value y = h, the area A = xy will vary from 0 to a maximum value and then back to 0. The area of the rectangle can now be expressed as either a function of x or as a function of y. For example, if A = xy, then one can write either</p><formula xml:id="formula_307">A =x h ? h b x = hx ? h b x 2 , 0 ¡Ü x ¡Ü b or A =b h ? y h y = b h (hy ? y 2 ), 0 ¡Ü y ¡Ü h</formula><p>These representation for the area can be differentiated to determine maximum and minimum values for the area A. Differentiating with respect to x one finds</p><formula xml:id="formula_308">dA dx = h ? 2 h b x</formula><p>and a critical value occurs when and a critical value occurs when dA dy = 0, or when y = h/2 which then gives x = b/2. In both cases one find the maximum area as A = hb/4. Note that there is only one critical point as y varies from 0 to h, since the area is zero at the end points where y = 0 and y = h, the Rolle's theorem implies there must be a maximum value somewhere between. That is, if the area is a continuous function of y and A increases as y increases from 0, then the only way for A to return to zero is for it to reach a maximum value, stop and then return to zero.</p></div>

The set of points C = { (x, y) | x = cos(t), y = sin(t), 0 &lt; t &lt; 2¦Ð } defines a circle of unit radius centered at the origin as illustrated in the figure 2-17. The parameter t has the physical significance of representing an angle of rotation.

If the point (x, y) = ( cosh (t), sinh (t)) on the hyperbola is connected to the origin by a straight line, then an area between the line, the x-axis and the hyperbola is formed having an area a. The physical significance of the parameter t in this representation is that t = 2a. This representation gives rise to the terminology of calling the functions in equations (2.78) and (2.79) the hyperbolic functions. Graphs of the hyperbolic functions, defined by the equations (2.79), are illustrated in the figures 2-18 and 2-19. which shows that the functions cosh (x) and sech (x) are even function of x symmetric about the y-axis and the functions sinh (x), tanh (x), csch (x) and coth (x) are odd functions of x being symmetric about the origin.</p></div>

The Euler formula can be employed to make a connection between the trigonometric functions and the hyperbolic functions.</p><p>In order to prove the Euler formula given by equation (2.89) the following result is needed.</p><p>If a function f (x) has a derivative f (x) which is everywhere zero within an interval, then the function f (x) must be a constant for all values of x within the interval.</p><p>The above result can be proven using the mean-value theorem considered earlier. If f (c) = 0 for all values c in an interval and x 1 = x 2 are arbitrary points within the interval, then the mean-value theorem requires that</p><formula xml:id="formula_388">f (c) = f (x 2 ) ? f (x 1 ) x 2 ? x 1 = 0</formula><p>This result implies that f (x 1 ) = f (x 2 ) for all values x 1 = x 2 in the interval and hence</p><p>f (x) must be a constant throughout the interval.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integral Calculus</head><p>The integral calculus is closely related to the differential calculus presented in the previous chapter. One of the fundamental uses for the integral calculus is the construction of methods for finding areas, arc lengths, surface areas and volumes associated with plane curves and solid figures. Many of the applications of the differential and integral calculus are also to be found in selected areas of engineering, physics, business, chemistry and the health sciences.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summations</head><p>The mathematical symbol is used to denote the summation of the terms f (j) as j varies from 1 to m. Here j = 1 is called the starting index for the sum and the m above the sigma sign is used to denote the ending index for the sum. The quantity j is called the dummy summation index because the letter j does not occur in the answer and j can be replaced by some other index if one desires to do so. The following are some examples illustrating how the summation notation is employed. (a) If m, n are integers satisfying 1 &lt; m &lt; n, then a summation from 1 to n of the f (j) terms can be broken up and written as a sum of m terms followed by a summation of (n ? m) terms by writing  substitution k = j ? 1 and noting that when j = 1, then k = 0 and when j = n, then k = n ? 1, so that the sum S can also be expressed S = n?1</p><formula xml:id="formula_488">k 2 . k=0 n</formula><p>As another example, the sum f (j) can be expressed in the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_489">n?m f (m+k). j=m+1 k=1</formula><p>This is called shifting the summation index. This result is obtained by making the substitution j = m + k and then finding the summation range for the index k. For example, when j = m + 1, then k = 1 and when j = n, then k = n ? m giving the above result.  is known as an arithmetic series with a called the first term, d called the common difference between successive terms, = a + (n ? 1)d is the last term and n is the number of terms.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sequences, Summations and Products</head><p>There are many different types of functions that arise in the application of mathematics to real world problems. In chapter two many of the basic functions used in mathematics were investigated and derivatives of these functions were calculated. In chapter three integration was investigated and it was demonstrated that definite integrals can be used to define and represent functions. Many of the functions previously introduced can be represented in a variety of ways. An infinite series is just one of the ways that can be used to represent functions. Some of the functions previously introduced are easy to represent as a series while others functions are very difficult to represent. In this chapter we investigate selected methods for representing functions. We begin by examining summation methods and multiplication methods to represent functions because these methods are easy to understand. In order to investigate summation and product methods to represent functions, one must know about sequences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sequences</head><p>A sequence is defined as a one-to-one correspondence between the set of positive integers n = 1, 2, 3, . . . and a set of real or complex quantities u 1 , u 2 , u 3 , . . ., which are given or defined in some specific way. Such a sequence of terms is often expressed as {u n }, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . or alternatively by {u n } ¡Þ n=1 or for short just by {u n }. The set of real or complex quantities {u n }, for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . is called an infinite sequence. The indexing or numbering for the terms in the sequence can be selected to begin with any convenient number. For example, there may be times when it is convenient to examine sequences such as {u n }, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .</p><formula xml:id="formula_818">or {u n }, n = ¦Í, ¦Í + 1, ¦Í + 2, . . .</formula><p>where ¦Í is some convenient starting index.</p><p>A sequence of real numbers can be represented as a function or mapping from the set of integers to the set of real numbers f : N ¡ú R and is sometimes represented as f (1), f (2), . . . or f 1 , f 2 , . . .. Similarly, a sequence of complex numbers can be represented as a function or mapping from the set of integers to the set of complex numbers</p><formula xml:id="formula_819">f : N ¡ú C.</formula><p>Example 4-1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limit of a Sequence</head><p>The limit of a sequence, if it exists, is the problem of determining the value of the sequence {u n } as the index n increases without bound. A sequence such as  This limit statement means that for n sufficiently large the values u n are as close as desired to the value 3.</p><p>Some sequences {u n } do not have a limit as the index n increases without bound. For example, the sequence u n = (?1) n for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . oscillates between the values +1 and ?1 and does not have a limit. Another example of a sequence which does not have a limit is the sequence {v n } where v n = 3 n for n = 1, 2, 3, . . .. Here the values v n increase without bound as n increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Convergence of a sequence</head><p>A sequence {u n }, n = 1, 2, 3, . . ., where u n can be a real or complex number, is said to converge to a number or have a limit , if to each small positive number If the sequence does not converge it is said to diverge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Divergence of a sequence</head><p>A sequence {u n } is said to diverge in the positive direction if for every number M &gt; 0, there exists a number N &gt; 0, such that u n &gt; M for all integers n &gt; N . This is sometimes expressed lim n¡ú¡Þ u n = ¡Þ. Similarly, a sequence {v n } is said to diverge in the negative direction if there exists numbers M &gt; 0 and N &gt; 0 such that v n &lt; ?M for all integers n &gt; N . This is sometimes expressed lim n¡ú¡Þ v n = ?¡Þ. When the sequence converges, the elements u n of the sequence tend to concentrate themselves around the point for large values of the index n. The terms u n do not have to approach at any specified rate nor do they have to approach from a particular direction. However, there may be times where u n approaches only from the left and there may be other times when u n approaches only from the right. These are just special cases associated with the more general definition of a limit given above. There are two geometric interpretations associated with the above limit statement. The first whenever u n = x n + i y n is a set of complex numbers and the second geometric interpretation arises whenever u n = x n represents a sequence of real numbers. These geometric interpretations are illustrated in the figure 4-1. In the case the sequence {u n } is a sequence of complex numbers, the quantity |z ? | &lt; represents an open disk centered at the point = 1 + i 2 and the statement lim n¡ú¡Þ u n = can be interpreted to mean that there exists an integer N , such that for all integers m &gt; N , the terms u m are trapped inside the circular disk of radius centered at . In the case where the terms u n = x n , n = 1, 2, 3, . . . are real quantities, the interpretation of convergence is that for all integers m &gt; N , the terms u m are trapped inside the interval ( ? + ). These regions of entrapment can be made arbitrarily small by making the quantity &gt; 0 small. In either case, there results an infinite number of terms inside the disk or interval illustrated in the figure 4-1. A sequence which is not convergent is called divergent or non-convergent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relation between Sequences and Functions</head><p>There is a definite relation associated with limits of sequences and limits of functions. For example, if {u n } is a sequence and f = f (x) is a continuous function defined for all x ¡Ý 1 with the property that u n = f (n) for all integers n ¡Ý 1, then if exists, the following limit statements are equivalent  </p><formula xml:id="formula_821">x ¡Ì x = lim x¡ú¡Þ 1/x 1/2 ¡Ì x = lim x¡ú¡Þ 2 ¡Ì x = 0</formula><p>The limit properties for functions also apply to sequences.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Establish Bounds for Sequences</head><p>A real sequence {u n }, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . is said to be bounded if there exists numbers m and M such that m ¡Ü u n ¡Ü M for all integers n.

If lim n¡ú¡Þ u n = , then there exists neighborhoods N given by (i) A circular neighborhood about given by |z ? | &lt; This occurs when the values u n are complex numbers and there are an infinite number of values u n from the sequence inside the circle and a finite number of points u n outside the circle.</p><p>(ii) An interval neighborhood given by ? &lt; u n &lt; + . Here the values u n are real numbers where there is an infinite number of points u n inside the interval and only a finite number of points outside the interval. These neighborhoods N represent bounded sets. By increasing the radius of the bounded sets N to encompass the finite number of points outside N , a new set can be constructed which will still be bounded and contain all the terms of the sequence.</p><p>If the real sequence {x j }, j = 1, 2, 3, . . . is a convergent sequence, then (i) The sequence must be bounded and (ii) The limit of the sequence is unique. Make note that it is sometimes convenient to replace the small quantity used in the definition of convergence by some other small quantity such as</p><formula xml:id="formula_826">2 , 2</formula><p>, or M , (M &gt; 0 constant). The small quantity used is usually selected so that when many applications of the inequality (4.1) are made, the final results add up to some convenient number.</p><p>To show the sequence must be bounded, use the definition of convergence of a sequence with a fixed value for . If the limit of the sequence is , then there exists an integer N such that for integers n satisfying n &gt; N</p><formula xml:id="formula_827">|x n | = |x n ? + | ¡Ü |x n ? | + || &lt; + || = M 1 for n &gt; N</formula><p>That is, if the sequence has a limit, then there exists a value N such that each term of the sequence x N+1 , x N+2 , . . . are less then M 1 in absolute value. Let us now examine the terms x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x N . Let M 2 = max {|x 1 |, |x 2 |, . . . , |x N |}. By selecting M = max{M 1 , M 2 }, it follows that |x j | &lt; M for all values of j and so the sequence is bounded. If the sequence is not bounded, then it diverges.</p><p>To show the limit of the sequence is unique, assume that there are two limits, say and . Now use the method of reductio ad absurdum to show this assumption is false. The assumption of convergence of the sequence insures that for every &gt; 0, there exists a value N 1 such that for all integers n &gt; N 1 there results |x n ? | &lt; 2 .

A finite oscillatory sequence {x n }, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . is a sequence of real numbers which bounce around between finite limits and does not converge. An example of a finite oscillatory sequence are the numbers {?1, 0, 1, ?1, 0, 1, ?1, 0, 1, . . .} with the pattern repeating forever.

A sequence {u j }, j = 1, 2, 3, . . ., is said to be Cauchy convergent or to satisfy the Cauchy convergence criteria if for every small quantity &gt; 0, there exists an integer N &gt; 0, such that if one selects any two terms from the sequence, say u m and u n , where n &gt; N and m &gt; n &gt; N , then |u m ? u n | &lt; The Cauchy criteria is another way of saying that for large values of m and n the terms of the sequence will always stay close together. Also observe that in using the Cauchy criteria it is not necessary to know the exact limit in order to demonstrate convergence.</p><p>There are alternative ways for expressing the Cauchy convergence condition. Some of these representations are the following. (i) A sequence of points u 1 = (x 1 , y 1 ), u 2 = (x 2 , y 2 ), . . . , u m = (x m , y m ), . . . , u n = (x n , y n ) tends to a limit point if and only if, for every &gt; 0 there exists an integer N = N () such that (x m ? x n ) 2 + (y m ? y n ) 2 &lt; whenever m &gt; N and n &gt; N .

If the limit of the sequence {u n } is , then for every &gt; 0 one can find an integer N such that for integers n and m both greater than N one will have |u n ? | &lt; 2 and |u m ? | &lt; 2 and consequently one can add and subtract to obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_830">|u n ? u m | = |(u n ? ) + ( ? u m )| ¡Ü |u n ? | + |u m ? | &lt; 2 + 2 =</formula><p>In more advanced mathematics courses one can show that the Cauchy convergence condition is both a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a limit for the sequence {u n }.</p><p>Example 4-4.

Note that if L is the least upper bound, then every number K &gt; L is also an upper bound to the set S L . If &gt; 0 is a small positive number, then one can state that L ? is not an upper bound of S L , but L + is an upper bound of the set S L . Let N denote an integer such that L ? &lt; u N . Such an integer N exists since the infinite set {u n } is monotone increasing. Once N is found, one can write that for all integers n &gt; N one must have L ? &lt; u N &lt; u n &lt; L + , which can also be written as the statement for all integers n &gt; N the inequality |u n ?

One finds that in general power series converge for some values of x and diverge for other values of x. If the power series converges for |x| &lt; R, then R is called the radius of convergence of the power series.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Properties of the Fourier trigonometric series</head><p>Conditions for the existence of a Fourier series are: (i) f (x) must be single-valued and piecewise continuous over the interval (?L, L).

One usually plots the approximating function S N (x) when representing the Fourier series?fseries? series?f (x) graphically. Whenever the function f (x) being approximated has a point where a jump discontinuity occurs, then the approximating function S N (x) has oscillations in the neighborhood of the jump discontinuity as well as an "overshoot" of the jump in the function. These effects are known as the Gibb's 17 phenomenon. The Gibb's phenomenon always occurs whenever one attempts to use a series of continuous functions to represent a discontinuous function. The Gibb's phenomenon is illustrated in the figure 4-7. These effects are not eliminated by increasing the value of N in the partial sum.</p></div>

Using a computer this number, to 50 decimal places, has the numerical value e = 2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369996 . . .</p><p>The number e is referred to as the base of the natural logarithm and the function f (x) = e x is called the exponential function.</p><p>Inequalities can be defined in terms of addition or subtraction. For example, one can define In dealing with inequalities be sure to observe the following properties associated with real numbers a, b, c, . . . 1. A constant can be added to both sides of an inequality without changing the inequality sign. since equals can be added to both sides of an inequality without changing the inequality sign. Using the fact that both sides of an inequality can be multiplied by a positive number without changing the inequality sign, one can write Another way to show a negative times a negative is a positive is as follows. Think of a number line with the number 0 separating the positive numbers and negative numbers. By agreement, if a number on this number line is multiplied by -1, then the number is to be rotated counterclockwise 180 degrees. If the positive number x is multiplied by -1, then it is rotated counterclockwise 180 degrees to produce the number ?x. If the number ?x is multiplied by -1, then it is to be rotated 180 degrees counterclockwise to produce the positive number x. If a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0, then the product a(?b) scales the number ?b to produce the negative number ?ab. If the number ?ab is multiplied by ?1, which is equivalent to the product (?a)(?b), one obtains by rotation the number +ab.</p></div>

In general, a derivative, such as dy dx = f (x), is a measure of the instantaneous rate of change of y = f (x) with respect to a change in x. The notation dy dx for the derivative was introduced by Gottfried Leibnitz. The prime notation f (x) for the derivative of a function f (x) was introduced by Joseph-Louis Lagrange 2 .

To prove this inequality observe that |x| satisfies ?|x| ¡Ü x ¡Ü |x| and also ?|y| ¡Ü y ¡Ü |y|, so that by adding these results one obtains ?(|x| + |y|) ¡Ü x + y ¡Ü |x| + |y| or |x + y| ¡Ü |x| + |y| (1.2) Related to the inequality (1.2) is the reverse triangle inequality |x ? y| ¡Ý |x| ? |y| (1.3)</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Representation of Functions</head><p>There are many areas of mathematics where functions f (x) are represented in the form of an infinite generalized continued fraction having the form f (x) = a 0 (x) + b 1 (x) (4.97)</p><p>a 3 (x) + ¡¤ ¡¤ ¡¤ + b n (x) a n (x) + r n+1 <ref type="bibr">(x)</ref> 338 where r n+1 (x) = b n+1 (x) a n+1 (x) + r n+2 <ref type="bibr">(x)</ref> . This continued fraction is often expressed in the more compact form <ref type="bibr">(4.98)</ref> in order to conserve space in typesetting. It is customary to select the functions a 0 (x), a i (x) and b i (x), i = 1, 2, 3, . . . as simple functions such as some linear function of x or a constant, but this is not a requirement for representing a function. If one selects the functions b i (x) and a i (x), for i = 1, 2, 3, . . . as polynomials, then whenever the continued fraction is truncated, the resulting function f n (x) becomes a rational function of x. The converse of this statement is that if f (x) is a rational function of x, then it is always possible to construct an equivalent continued fraction.</p><p>Observe also that the reciprocal function is given by  r i (x) = 0 so it is possible to calculate the coefficients a i , i = 1, 2, 3, . . . and show (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , a 4 , a 5 , . . . , a n , . . .) = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, . . ., 2n + 1, . . .)</p><p>Evaluating the arctangent function at x = 1 gives the continued fraction given in the previous example 4-29.</p></div>

The norm squared is defined</p><p>with norm given by f = (f, f ). If the inner product of two functions f and g with respect to a weight function r is zero, then the functions f and g are said to be orthogonal functions.</p></div>

Now expand f and g in Taylor series expansions about the point (x 0 , y 0 ). These expansions can be written f (x 0 + h, y 0 + k) = f (x 0 , y <ref type="bibr">0</ref>  Usually the initial guess (x 0 , y 0 ) is such that f (x 0 , y 0 ) and g(x 0 , y 0 ) are not zero. It is desired to find values h and k such that the equations f (x 0 + h, y 0 + k) = 0 and g(x 0 + h, y 0 + k) = 0 are satisfied simultaneously. Now assume that the values h and k to be selected are small corrections to x 0 and y 0 so that second-order terms h 2 , hk, k 2 , and higher order product terms are small and can consequently be neglected in the above Taylor series expansion. These assumptions produce the linear system of equations which can then be solved to determine the correction terms h and k. (a) Show by letting h = x 1 ? x 0 and k = y 1 ? y 0 that an improved estimate for the solution to the simultaneous equations f (x, y) = 0 and g(x, y) = 0, is given by Hint: Nonlinear equations may have multiple solutions, a unique solution, or no solutions at all.

Problems which involve rates of change of two or more time dependent variables are referred to as " related rate problems ". The general procedure for solving related rate problems is something like the following.</p><p>1. If necessary, define the variables of the problem and make note of the units of measurement being used. For example, one could write <ref type="bibr">[Q]</ref> = cubic centimeters which is read 1 "The dimension of Q is cubic centimeters". 2.

How fast is the water level rising when the water level, as measured from the vertex of the cone, is 4 feet?

Remember, that when dealing with functions of more than one variable, you are going to be holding one of the variables constant during a partial differentiation or partial integration.
