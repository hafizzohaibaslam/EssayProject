			<abstract>
				<p>Microgrids have recently emerged as a building block for smart grids combining distributed renewable energy sources (RESs), energy storage devices, and load management methodologies. The intermittent nature of RESs brings several challenges to the smart microgrids, such as reliability, power quality, and balance between supply and demand. Thus, forecasting power generation from RESs, such as wind turbines and solar panels, is becoming essential for the efficient and perpetual operations of the power grid and it also helps in attaining optimal utilization of RESs. Energy demand forecasting is also an integral part of smart microgrids that helps in planning the power generation and energy trading with commercial grid. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based models are promising solutions for predicting consumers&apos; demands and energy generations from RESs. In this context, this manuscript provides a comprehensive survey of the existing DL-based approaches, which are developed for power forecasting of wind turbines and solar panels as well as electric power load forecasting. It also discusses the datasets used to train and test the different DL-based prediction models, enabling future researchers to identify appropriate datasets to use in their work. Even though there are a few related surveys regarding energy management in smart grid applications, they are focused on a specific production application such as either solar or wind. Moreover, none of the surveys review the forecasting schemes for production and load side simultaneously. Finally, previous surveys do not consider the datasets used for forecasting despite their significance in DL-based forecasting approaches. Hence, our survey work is intrinsically different due to its data-centered view, along with presenting DL-based applications for load and energy generation forecasting in both residential and commercial sectors. The comparison of different DL approaches discussed in this manuscript reveals that the efficiency of such forecasting methods is highly dependent on the amount of the historical data and thus a large number of data storage devices and high processing power devices are required to deal with big data. Finally, this study raises several open research problems and opportunities in the area of renewable energy forecasting for smart microgrids.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The power sector is moving towards renewable energy sources (RESs) because of their low price and massive contributions in reduction of carbon emissions. RESs consist of a number of resources, which include bioenergy, wind energy, hydropower, photovoltaic (PV) energy, etc. Usually, these RESs are operated in islanded and grid-connected modes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Solar and wind energies are generated by installing PV panels and wind turbines (WTs), respectively, and these are handy in most places around the globe. Besides, RESs play an important role in minimizing carbon emissions among various electricity sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. Moreover, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> indicates the yearly proportion of renewable power contribution to the whole electricity generation of some leading countries of the world. Brazil generates a huge amount of power from renewable sources (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>) in order to meet the consumers' power demand. Solar panels convert direct sunlight to electrical energy, while WTs generate electric power from wind. The key characteristics of these energy sources are limited controllability, limited predictability, and power output variability as the power produced from RESs completely relies upon environmental factors like solar irradiance, temperature, humidity, and wind speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. For example, PV panels produce higher energy in case of high solar radiation (clear sky) and they generate minimum energy (may be 0) during cloudy weather or at night times. On the contrary, WTs generate minimum energy (may be zero) in case of lower and higher wind speed than cut-in and cut-out speed, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Thus, large fluctuations in power generation from PV plants and WTs introduce several challenges, including voltage irregulations as well as reserve power flow problems and power distribution issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. To make matters worse, energy consumers also exhibit intermittent behavior in power consumption because of various factors, like environmental changes, user preferences, etc.</p><p>As mentioned above, the integration of RESs complicate the power grid operations and microgrids introduce difficulties in maintaining balance between energy generation and consumption (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> for microgrid architecture). Therefore, accurate forecasting of energy generation from RESs (i.e., PV panels and WTs) along with electric load forecasting is an exigent need of the current smart grid era. Accurate load/demand forecasting allows the utility companies to control demand-driven supply effectively and produce surplus power from other resources (traditional power generation portfolios) when RESs are unable to meet consumers' demand.</p><p>Reliable prediction of wind and solar power generation form WTs and solar panels, respectively, is a challenging task, as it relies entirely on weather patterns (e.g., humidity, temperature, irradiance, etc.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12]</ref>. Forecasting can be performed using several methods, including physical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>, machine learning (ML) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15]</ref>, and (more recently) deep learning (DL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17]</ref>. In the last decade, ML and DL approaches have been applied in several domains of computational intelligence and forecasting, where they demonstrated promising efficacy. For example, they are employed for energy optimization and forecasting in smart microgrids <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18]</ref>, energy prediction in wheat production <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>, health services improvements <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>, performance improvement in wireless networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>, flood management <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>, and hydrogen production forecasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>. However, all the forecasting methods have their own pros and cons. For instance, physical methods are effective in predicting the dynamics of the atmosphere, but they need significant computational resources since a huge amount of data is required to calibrate the dynamics of the atmosphere. Further issues arise when physical approaches find unexpected estimation errors, while they are also not suitable for short-term forecasting horizons. Similarly, most of the current renewable energy prediction statistical models are designed as linear models, which limits their ability to solve more complex forecasting issues with longer forecasting time horizons.</p><p>Contrary to physical models, ML-based forecasting approaches usually offer more accurate results than statistical and physical models due to their advanced data mining and feature extraction capabilities. However, as a general rule, ML-based forecasting approaches use some "shallow" models as their central learning concepts. Typical shallow patterns are trees, regressors, or neural networks with zero or one hidden layer. It is well known that the training of such shallow models requires a great deal of experience and skill. Moreover, the theoretical study of shallow structures is often challenging. Thus, in practical applications, shallow models have significant drawbacks. However, it has been recently established that DL-based energy generation and power  load forecasting approaches outperform the aforementioned methods since, unlike ML-based approaches, DL-based approaches do not suffer from hand-engineered feature selection, sample complexity, and weak generalization efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Even though the forecasting of load demand and energy from RESs is a new research area, it has already gained significant attention from the research community. Lately, a lot of research studies have proposed DLbased approaches for such forecasting, while several survey/review works have been conducted <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>, where they attempted to survey DL methods for energy or load forecasting from various perspectives and scopes. For instance, some recent survey papers present an overview of microgrid and RESs, such as solar power, wind energy, geothermal energy, hydro energy, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32]</ref>. The work presented in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref> reviews ten major ML models that were frequently employed in energy systems. A brief review of the load monitoring (LM) strategies is discussed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>. Surveys of building energy consumption prediction and overview of ML methods are given in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37]</ref>. A review study presented in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref> discusses DL-based methods for solar irradiance prediction, while the papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref> disclose recent studies on both solar and wind energy forecasting using DL/ML methods. A more detailed discussion about state-of-the-art survey works is presented in Section 2 and <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. List of abbreviations is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> of this manuscript.</p><p>However, the existing studies only review either some particular topics or consider a specific issue. There is no survey/review study that considers a broad involvement of DL methods in smart microgrids in simultaneous ways, e.g., load forecasting and energy generation prediction from photovoltaic and wind turbines. In addition, none of the existing surveys review datasets that were employed for load and energy forecasting. The above motivate us to deliver this study with a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art DL-based approaches developed to forecast the power generation from WTs and solar panels, along with the forecasting of load demand of consumers. Various datasets reported in the literature for the prediction of wind speed/energy and solar irradiance/ energy are also presented in this study. Our comprehensive review and analysis makes this manuscript useful for beginners as well as experts working in this domain. This study further helps the reader in tracking datasets used by researchers and developing real-world forecasting applications. Finally, this study can serve as a technical reference for comparison and selection of effective and efficient forecasting strategies.</p><p>The rest of the manuscript is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses past surveys in the area of energy management systems (EMSs) and highlights our contributions. Section 3 outlines the methodology of this survey. Section 4 offers a summary of the main DL techniques, while Section 5 describes the use of DL in EMSs and various forecasting models. This section also reviews the datasets that are used to train and test the reviewed DL-based forecasting models. Section 6 investigates the potential issues of the existing DL-based approaches. Finally, the last section concludes the survey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work, motivation, and contributions</head><p>There are a lot of research works published regarding energy management in smart grid/microgrids that present problems and solutions along with future opportunities in the area of smart energy management <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>. Nowadays, researchers are working to explore ML, DL, and artificial intelligence technologies to tackle smart grid challenges. Such techniques provide powerful tools for the planning, modeling, monitoring, fault diagnostics, and fault-tolerant operation of advanced smart grids and renewable energy systems. In order to organize and summarize the current status of DL-based approaches for energy and load forecasting, several review/survey articles have been presented by the research community. In this section, an overview of these articles is disclosed. At the end, this section also highlights how our manuscript differs from past surveys.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>, authors present an overview of RESs, such as solar power, wind energy, geothermal energy, hydro energy, etc. Furthermore, the significant role of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the performance of renewable energy is uncovered in various aspects, including decision, control, optimization, and simulations. At the end, they conclude that the performance of the smart grid and microgrid can be enhanced by employing AI-based techniques. The study at <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref> presents a brief review of the load monitoring (LM) strategies in energy management systems (EMSs). This work categorizes the energy management in two broad types: (i) intrusive LM that refer to distributed sensing, and (ii) non-intrusive LM that belong to single-point sensing. They also analyze intrusive and non-intrusive based LM schemes for energy management in the smart grid. In addition, this study presents an analysis of current literature as well as future prospects in LM for energy management. Some of the future problems regarding LM raised in their work include accurate disaggregation/recognition, non-intrusive LM application in EMS, non-traditional signatures usage to improve the accuracy of non-intrusive LM, and smart meter usage in EMS.</p><p>Amasyali et al. covered data-driven prediction studies for building energy consumption (BEC) in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>, where they review the prediction steps in detail (i.e., data gathering, data preprocessing, model training, and testing of the trained model). Furthermore, they present ML-based algorithms along with their performance in terms of building energy predictions. Performance evaluation criteria of different studies are also disclosed in this work. Finally, gaps are uncovered in the existing research and future directions are provided to the research community in the field of data-driven BEC prediction.</p><p>Another review work on data-driven based strategies is presented at <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>. Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>, the research presented at <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref> considers data-driven approaches for prediction as well as for the classification of BEC. Their review work demonstrates that a large amount of building energy applications are addressed by data-driven strategies. These applications include load forecasting/prediction, benchmarking for building stocks, guideline making, and power pattern profiling. At the end, this work paves an opportunity for the researchers to explore the potential in small-scale energy minimization via considering consumers' demands.</p><p>Voyant et al. presented a review in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>, which unfolds the ML-based methodologies to predict the solar irradiance. It is important to note that solar irradiance must be predicted in order to forecast energy generation from the solar panel. This survey presents ML-based prediction models in terms of classification, data preparation, learning (supervised and unsupervised), and accuracy evaluation. Additionally, a comparative analysis is presented to determine the accuracy of various prediction models.</p><p>Research work at <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> presents a critical review of smart microgrid energy management methods, problems, and their solutions. As electricity generation in microgrids is intermittent in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>, summarizes the methods/strategies to tackle the volatile and intermittent behavior of the microgrid. A variety of EMSs are discussed in detail, which are developed through different approaches, e.g., classical methods, linear programming, heuristics schemes, evolutionary approaches, swarm optimization, fuzzy logic, neural network, etc. Moreover, communication technologies used in the microgrid are disclosed and comparative analysis among them is performed. Real-time applications of microgrids and future challenges conclude this study.</p><p>Authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref> have summarized the studies on solar and wind energy forecasting using DL-based prediction techniques. This study states that robustness, reliability, generalization ability, accuracy, sustainability, and precision are the prominent issues when using DL-based algorithms for energy prediction of renewable energy sources. The performance of DL-based algorithms is much better than other computationally intensive prediction techniques when dealing with big datasets; however, the performance is low in case of small datasets. The authors have broadly categorized the DL-based forecasting algorithms into single and hybrid forecasting methods and concluded that hybrid DL techniques provide better forecasting results compared to single DL techniques.</p><p>The research contributions presented at <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">35]</ref> survey wind energy and solar power prediction approaches, respectively. In addition, the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref> also discuss applications of ANN in WT system design and fault detection. Fallah et al. presented a review work in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>, which explores and summarizes the efforts of researchers in developing load forecasting algorithms. Another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref> reviews load forecasting methods, while the authors classify the forecasting algorithms in several types based on short-term, very short-term, medium-term, and long-term load forecasting.</p><p>Contributions. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> summarizes the closely related surveys/reviews on smart microgrids and reveals our survey's novelty.

Furthermore, none of the presented works focused on the datasets used for forecasting. Our survey work is therefore intrinsically different due to its data-centered view, along with DL-based application for load and energy <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> Comparative analysis of our work and existing review/survey studies.

Considering for review: All articles selected in steps 2 and 3 were reviewed to disclose their objectives of forecasting, employed/proposed DL/ML methods, forecasting type (long-term, short-term), data source and type, modeling performance, and compared approaches. 5. Analyzing review results In the last step, review results were analyzed in order to find superior approaches for load or energy forecasting. Research gaps and future opportunities were also found in this phase.</p><p>The primary objective of the research methodology is to identify, classify, and review the DL approaches that are employed for load demand or energy forecasting (for solar and wind energy). The main focus during paper selection was on works that were conducted from the period 2015 to 2020. In our comprehensive review, the methodology consisted of five primary steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Evaluation criteria</head><p>1. Keyword-based search: As a first step, we performed a keywordbased search of research studies using Google Scholar. Since Google Scholar ranks articles based on various factors, i.e., authors, publishers, number of citations, and published year, it was selected for searching high-quality articles. Examples of our keywords include data-driven load forecasting, building energy consumption forecasting, load forecasting, wind energy forecasting, wind speed forecasting, solar energy forecasting, solar irradiance forecasting, as well as machine and deep learning for energy management in smart grids. 2. Screening of papers: Next, we performed screening of the retrieved research papers that were found through the previous step. The criteria of screening were that the study focuses on power load or energy prediction and employs single DL, single ML, or hybrid DL/ ML approaches. 3. Identifying extra articles: In this step, we found some extra articles based on the papers that were identified in step 2. Specifically, articles that were cited in the selected papers and articles citing the Since the prediction accuracy is a critical factor in selecting any forecasting model, the performance of DL algorithms in this survey paper is compared on the basis of the potential of the proposed approaches to establish the most accurate predictions. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) are selected as the three basic evaluation metrics, since they are the most popular metrics used in the reviewed papers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Artificial neural network</head><p>An artificial neural network (ANN) is constructed based on the working principle of the human nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>. The ANN is entirely based on a set of neurons, which are the fundamental parts of a neural network (NN) in which communications happen. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>, a basic ANN architecture is depicted. An input is received and output is generated by neurons based on their internal activation functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">44]</ref>. The weights and parameters determining the activation functions are modified by a mechanism known as learning. For ANNs, the key parameters that control learning are the learning rate parameter, the number of hidden layers, and the maximum number of iterations. The input, hidden, and output layers may contain a different number of neurons. Different activation functions, like Sigmoid, Rectified Linear Unit, and Softmax, are used for computation within the ANNs. The advantages of ANN include: information is stored on the entire network so loss of any piece of information does not affect the performance of ANN, fault tolerance, and it has a parallel processing capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>. On the contrary, the disadvantages of ANN include: hardware dependency as it requires processors with parallel processing power, lack of interpretability of the network, and the duration of network is unknown <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">46]</ref>. layers, FC layers, flatten layers, dropout layers, and normalization layers. An activation function hides the input and the output of the hidden layer. In CNN, the linear unit rectifier (Relu) is the most commonly adopted activation function and it includes a back-propagation method to generate more reliable weights.</p><p>CNN's convolutional layer is employed to detect patterns and features from the input file. At this layer, filters are applied to the input file and activation maps are generated. The following equation is used to generate the dimension of the activation map <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N + 2P ?

An ANN with two or more hidden layers is called DNN. To generate the output, the DNN investigates the input data using mathematical manipulation. The NN is trained by exploiting the training set resulting typically in the probability calculation for each output. DNNs have similar advantages and disadvantages with ANNs, but since DNNs comprises more layers than ANNs, they often require more training data to attain better results compared to ANN.</p><p>In the ablove equation, N represents the dimension of input data, P is the padding, S is the stride, and F represents the dimensions of the filter. After the convolutional layer, the spooling layer downscales the data such that processing is simpler, although the actual data remain the same. Through dimensionality reduction, this layer reduces the scale of the input data and minimizes the computational complexity required to process the data. It also extracts the dominant features that help in efficient training of the model. There exist two types of pooling layers: 1) average-pooling layer and 2) max-pooling layer. The average-pooling layer calculates the average values of the data using the kernel and the max-pooling layer uses the maximum values covered by the kernel in the data. Max pooling is commonly used in a CNN. The following equation is used to compute the output file <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref>.</p></div>

It is a revised form of a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The MLP is a fullyconnected (FC) layered network, where each neuron is FC with all other neurons of another layer. The completely connected property leads to the problem of over-fitting. Hence, the CNN utilizes different methods for regularization of the results in order to avoid the over-fitting issue.

In this layer, every neuron of each layer is connected with each neuron of other layer, like MLP. In the FC layer, most of the parameters are occupied, which lead to the over-fitting problem. This problem is resolved by the dropout layer. Using a threshold value starting at 0.5, some of the inputs are removed. The value is often reduced to 0.01 because the increase in dropout leads to losing effective information. The actual weights are then added after training the data at the initial stage. After dropout layer, the data is passed to the flatten layer. It converts the data to a column vector form. The feed-forward NN and the back-propagation methods are then applied at every training step. After the flatten layer, the model is trained enough to distinguish between the dominant features and the low-level features. Finally, the softmax activation function is applied for classification purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref>.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">考(Z) i = e ﹉ K j=1 e zj .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>In this equation, Z represents the input vector of K real numbers. z is an element of input vector Z, such that Z = {z 1 , z 2 , z 3 , ＃, z K } and i = deal with sequential data efficiently, and it provides acceptable accuracy while predicting based on time-series data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Deep belief network</head><p>RNNs were developed to process sequential data and are able to establish a temporal correlation of current circumstances with previous information. For instance, RNNs make decisions at time step t on the bases of t ? 1 and t. This type of RNN characteristics makes it able to efficiently solve the load forecasting and energy generation prediction of solar/wind energy sources. Moreover, RNNs are trained by backpropagation through time <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[62]</ref>. However, long-range learning is difficult with RNNs because of exploding or gradient vanishing problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">60]</ref>.</p><p>To solve the aforementioned problems in RNNs, Hochreiter et al. introduced long short term memory (LSTM) by including a memory cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[63]</ref>, which was further enhanced by adding an extra forget gate <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[64]</ref>. LSTM is considered to be one of the most efficient NN architectures for time-series forecasting and modeling. Conventional NNs learn the correspondence among input and output from a static perspective. However, information is lost when time-series data is independently trained as input and output of NNs. The RNN makes a link between each pair of A deep belief network (DBN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[55]</ref> contains multiple restricted boltzmann machines (RBMs) that are considered primary elements of the DBN <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[56]</ref>. The RBM is an updated form of a boltzmann machine <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref> by adding node connections. The RBM contains two key layers, namely visible and hidden layers. Moreover, DBN uses both supervised and unsupervised learning. In particular, unsupervised learning is used in the pre-training phase, whereas supervised learning is exploited in the fine-tuning phase. Selection of appropriate initial parameters, weights, and bias is performed by unsupervised learning using independent variables. In this way, the pre-training stage rebuilds training samples by tuning variables to enhance likelihood estimation. Supervised learning further tunes the weights and bias on the basis of initial parameters that are given by the pre-training stage. Overall, DBN networks train differently compared to DNNs and ANNs as they use energy-based training functions to propagate data throughout the unsupervised training mode. Based on a past critical analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>, DBN is highly capable to deal with similar image data; however, it has high computational complexity. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 6</ref> presents a DBN model with L number of layers, where the input and output layers are presented on the left and right sides, respectively.</p><p>"input-output", as presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 8</ref>, where x denotes input data, y shows output data, and h presents the hidden states. The terms W hx , W yh , and W hh denote the matrices of weights, which show the relationship between h and x, y and h, and h and h, respectively. Furthermore, unlike simple RNN, the LSTM has two hidden states h t and c t to capture the long-term dependencies. Hidden states h t and c t are designed to keep the short-term and long-term information, respectively. The hidden state c has an additional mechanism that helps LSTM to strategically forget unnecessary information. LSTM has introduced three control gates to keep the information for the long-term, as presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 9</ref>. The LSTM is capable to solve vanishing gradient problems and make shorter the pre-processing of data <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>. The main drawbacks of LSTMs are: they need huge amount of resources to deal with big data, training process is very difficult, and they need high memory-bandwidth because of the linear layers present in each cell, which makes them inefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[64]</ref>.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 9</ref>, LSTM has three gates: forget gate (denoted by f t ), input gate (denoted by i t ), and output gate (denoted by o t ). The forget gate determines which information is kept from the last state and utilizes a sigmoid activation function. The forget gate can be formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">f t = 考 ( W f .[h t? 1 , X t ] + b f ) (5)</formula><p>where, f t and 考 show forget gate vector at interval t and sigmoid</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Recurrent neural network</head><p>For the processing of sequential data, a special form of NN, proposed by the research community, is known as recurrent neural network (RNN). The CNNs typically provide training independently to each sample; however, this form of independent training is not enough, particularly for sound, text, image, and time-related data. RNN solves this problem and it takes input sequentially. It includes feedback connections in the hidden layer units, as opposed to other feed-forward NNs. RNN will, therefore, undergo temporal processing and learn sequentially. In addition, the RNN exploits a hidden layer as a memory in order to store sequential information, unlike other NNs. In addition, the RNN employes the same parameters (U, V, W) for each layer, as opposed to conventional DNNs that use different parameters for each layer (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 7</ref>). This figure unfolds RNN into a full network. Moreover, in RNN calculations, x t shows input at time t, while s t and o t represent the hidden and output state at time t, respectively. The key advantages of RNN are that it remembers complete information based on time, it can  activation function, respectively. W f presents the weight matrix of forget gate and X t denotes inputs.

Furthermore, an optimal utilization of RESs can be achieved by implementing an efficient energy management strategy, for instance, by shifting all the load and ESS charging to solar energy in day time instead purchasing from utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Wind energy forecasting</head><p>In the last decade, noticeable attention has been given to wind energy owing to a cleaner source of energy. WTs are considered the lowest carbon emitters <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[56]</ref>. However, the uncertainty and fluctuations (due to weather conditions) of wind energy generation bring severe issues that hinder the economic operations of the power system <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. Hence, accurate forecasting of wind energy is of vital importance for the efficient operations of Energy Management Systems (EMSs) in the residential sector. Without accurate and reliable prediction of wind energy, maximum benefit from EMS cannot be achieved. Therefore, research community has spent much effort on developing wind energy forecasting methods, which are elaborated in detail in this section. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> describes various datasets used in wind speed and energy forecasting, whereas <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> summarizes the efforts of the research community regarding forecasting of wind energy and speed. The majority of the wind speed datasets are collected in Asia, span two to three years, and contain fine-grained data (recording step ranges from 5 min to 1 h) of wind speed, wind direction, temperature, humidity, and pressure among others. Similarly, the developed methods focus on forecasting wind speed and wind power generation with a time horizon ranging from 5 min to 1 h. The key difference among the forecasting methods are in using different variations or combinations of the DL models discussed in Section 4, leading to different forecast accuracy results as listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>.</p><p>The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[56]</ref> propose a wind speed forecasting method for efficient energy management, where they exploit DL, namely deep belief network (DBN) along with a genetic algorithm (GA). GA is used for determining the DBN's parameters. They use real-time weather data from various regions of Taiwan. Both multivariate regression and time series datasets are exploited to forecast wind speed. They performed simulations to validate the effectiveness of their developed DBN and GA based forecasting model. Results demonstrate the productiveness of their developed model over counterparts. Cheng et al. also developed a wind energy forecasting model in a residential area <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[70]</ref>. The developed model consists of an RNN, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and wavelet threshold denoising (WTD). WTD is used to smooth the wind speed series to capture variation trends and RNN is trained on datasets that are provided by the WTD layer. Eventually, ANFIS is considered the top layer of the ensemble model and it performs final wind speed prediction, which in turn can be used for predicting wind power generation. The developed method is then evaluated on 1-h-ahead wind speed prediction and results affirm its superiority over counterparts.</p><p>The research presented at <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[73]</ref> has proposed a wind speed prediction model under cost-oriented loss functions, where a cost-oriented boosted regression tree (BRT) method is developed to formulate the efficient forecasting of wind speed. Various case studies with real-time datasets are presented to verify the productivity of the presented method and a comparison with conventional unbiased forecasting methods is performed. Comparative results are evident of the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Another study proposed a direct quantile regression (DQR) method for wind power prediction that combines the quantile regression and extreme learning machine <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[75]</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Ref. [87]</ref>, wind energy shows higher volatility in intra-hour resolution (i.e., 10-min, 15-min, etc.) as compared to hourly wind power. Therefore, the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[75]</ref> considers multi-step probabilistic prediction of 10-min wind energy. A comparative study is also presented in this work, where various well-known methods of wind energy forecasting, such as RBFNN, Smart Persistence, BELM-Normal, and BELM-Beta, are compared against the performance of newly developed forecasting method. Results show the efficacy of the newly developed 10-min wind power forecasting method.</p><p>The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[76]</ref> proposed a data-driven probabilistic wind energy ramp forecasting (p-WPRF) technique that is based on a huge amount of simulated scenarios. A publicly available dataset from Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[88]</ref> (containing data for a location near Dallas, Texas, USA) is exploited to affirm the effectiveness of the proposed ramp forecasting model. The authors performed simulation studies to show the efficacy of p-WPRF model and results affirm the productiveness of this work with higher accuracy and reliability.</p><p>Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[78]</ref> proposed a hybrid approach known as EWT-LSTM-Elman for wind speed prediction that is the combination of empirical wavelet transformation (EWT) and two types of RNNs. The EWT is exploited to decompose the raw wind speed data into multiple sub-layers and the LSTM neural network is adopted to forecast the low-frequency wind speed sub-layers. At the end, an Elman neural network (ENN) is utilized to predict the high-frequency sub-layers. Furthermore, to measure the performance of the newly proposed EWT-LSTM-Elman forecasting algorithm, eleven different forecasting algorithms are considered as benchmarks. Experimental results validate the developed algorithm in terms of high precision wind speed forecasting.</p><p>Another study at <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[80]</ref> presents a hybrid method for time-series wind energy forecasting, which combines the non-linear learning ensemble of DL, support vector regression machine (SVRM), LSTM, and external optimization (EO) technique. The newly developed algorithm is named as EnsemLSTM. First, unlike a single DL approach, a cluster of LSTMs is adopted to exploit and explore time-series data of wind speed. Then, non-linear regression is exploited to aggregate the forecasting of LSTMs. The top-layer of the proposed model contains SVRM. EO and final ensemble forecasting of wind speed is given by fine-tuning of the  top-layer. The datasets are used from the wind farms of Inner Mongolia to perform experiments to affirm the performance of the newly developed hybrid method. In addition, the work [80] considers two case studies: forecasting of wind speed considering (i) hourly time intervals and (ii) 10-min time intervals. A comparative study also has been taken into account, where five forecasting algorithms are employed as benchmarks, i.e., GBRT, KNN, ANN, SVR, and ARIMA. It is observed from simulations that developed EnsemLSTM has higher performance than the compared algorithms.</p><p>The work presented in Ref.</p><p>[81] also tackles the wind forecasting problem and proposed a DL-based ensemble approach, where an advance point prediction model is developed based on the wavelet transform (WT) and CNN. WT decomposes wind speed data into various frequencies, while non-linear features of various frequencies, learned by CNN, are employed to enhance the forecast accuracy. To check the performance of the newly developed DL-based ensemble-based method, real-time datasets containing uncertainties are used from China. Further, the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[81]</ref> also implemented their proposed method for wind energy forecasting during the four seasons, i.e., summer, winter, spring, and autumn. Results from simulations demonstrated that the proposed method efficiently tackles the uncertainties and provides satisfactory performance.</p><p>Ruiguo et al. developed an LSTM-enhanced forget-gate (LSTM-EFG) network for wind energy forecasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[82]</ref>. The developed method replaces the tanh activation function with the softsign activation function, excludes the input-gate of traditional LSTM, and subtracts the output of the forget-gate in the way of the all-1 matrix. It utilizes the results as the input of the data update. In this way, the convergence speed is enhanced by the newly developed model LSTM-EFG. In addition, this model also exploits the feature extraction method that is hybridized with cluster methods in order to select the data having similar characteristics. Extensive experiments have been performed in the study and results show that the LSTM-EFG achieves minimum MSE value compared to well-established methods such as LSTM, SVR, and KNN.</p><p>The study presented in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[84]</ref> proposes a hybrid algorithm to forecast the big multi-step wind speed. ENN, wavelet packet decomposition (WPD), wavelet packet filter (WPF), and boosting algorithms are exploited to enhance the forecast accuracy. Furthermore, this study utilizes four time-series datasets to affirm the performance of the newly proposed WPD-Boost-ENN-WPF algorithm. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed forecasting algorithm over counterparts in terms of big multi-step wind speed prediction.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[86]</ref>, Hu et al. present a hybrid algorithm, namely LSTMDE-HELM, for long-term wind speed forecasting, where they perform hybridization by combining the best features of hysteretic extreme learning machine (HELM), LSTM, non-linear combined mechanism, and differential evolution (DE) algorithm. The working of the developed hybrid method is as follows: firstly, a biological neural system property named hysteresis in the activation function of ELM is used to enhance its efficiency. Afterward, DE is adopted to optimize the number of hidden layers in the LSTM to maintain a balance between learning performance and complexity of the LSTM (as there is no clear mechanism in order to set the hidden layers of LSTM). Finally, the prediction results of each predictor in the developed hybrid algorithm are aggregated by the non-linear combined mechanism, which is the combination of LSTM and DE. Furthermore, extensive experiments are performed to affirm the effectiveness of the newly developed hybrid forecasting method. For this purpose, the authors have exploited real-time wind speed data of Inner Mongolia and China. A comparative study has been performed to show the efficacy of the LSTMDE-HELM model. Results indicate the higher performance over the compared algorithms, namely, LSTM, ELM, SVR, ANN, and ARIMA, in terms of forecast accuracy.</p><p>Another work <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[85]</ref> presents a hybrid algorithm, termed SSA-EMD-CNNSVM, which combines the best features of EMD, singular spectrum analysis (SSA), and CNNSVM for multi-step wind speed forecasting. In the newly developed hybrid algorithm, the SSA is employed to mitigate the noise and it extracts trends in the actual wind speed data. The EMD is employed to explore the fluctuation features from wind data and decompose time-series wind speed to multiple sub-layers. CNNSVM is utilized to forecast the wind speed sub-layers. Furthermore, to examine the forecasting efficiency of the newly developed hybrid algorithm, several benchmarks are taken into account and experiments are performed. According to experimental results, the proposed SSA-EMD-CNNSVM forecasting method has satisfactory performance over counterparts for 1-step-3-step wind speed forecasting with the MAPE = 42.85%, MAE = 39.21%, and RMSE = 39.25% average performance promotion.</p><p>The use of DNNs appears to be one of the most commonly used wind energy prediction techniques.

The study presented in Ref.</p><p>[107] developed a DL-based hybrid algorithm for short-term solar irradiance prediction. The hybrid method combines GRU network with an attention mechanism, where an Inception NN (INN) is developed for feature extraction from original data. The proposed inception-based hybrid GRU approach is tested on the dataset taken from Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[108]</ref>, and results show higher performance over single LSTM and GRU in terms of forecast accuracy. Each prediction model has its own pros and cons in predicting solar irradiance and PV power generation; thus, it is difficult to determine which is the best among all the models. However, the following findings are suggested from the studies examined in this paper. For a single model, many studies demonstrate that LSTM has higher efficiency over RNN under all circumstances because the LSTM has intrinsic memory to resolve vanishing gradient issues arising in the RNN. In addition, multiple studies examined reveal that the hybrid models perform better than the standalone ones in the prediction of solar irradiance. This is evident in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figs. 13 and 14</ref>, which compare existing approaches using the same datasets, as reported in the original papers. However, in terms of computational or training time, GRU exhibits more efficiency compared to LSTM. Overall, taking into account training time and estimation accuracy, the GRU model yields a satisfactory result for the forecasting of PV power and solar irradiance.</p></div>

An accurate load/demand forecasting for energy consumers is a challenging task because of their stochastic behavior regarding electricity consumption. However, a lot of research studies have focused to tackle this issue and this section critically analyses these studies along with their benefits and drawbacks. <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 7</ref> describes various datasets used for forecasting electric load and consumption, whereas various studies on the forecasting of electricity load and electricity consumption are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 8</ref>. The majority of datasets contain hourly load data spanning several months along with time information (e.g., month, day of week) and temperature, which are considered strong predictors of electric load for both commercial and residential consumers. Based on this data, the surveyed approaches employ a wide range of DL algorithms to make hourly forecasts for the next few hours to few days, and offer different degrees of forecasting performance as listed in  <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[116]</ref> also exploits a DBN model for power load forecasting on the basis of historical data. It considers real-time time-series historical load data of South Africa for demand forecasting. In addition, weather parameters, like wind speed, temperature, etc. are also taken into account to check their impacts and to improve the forecast accuracy of the proposed model. Simulations have been performed to validate the model, while the temperature impact on forecast error is also analyzed. Results show the effectiveness of the developed model.</p><p>Robinson et al.</p><p>[117] developed a power demand forecasting model for commercial consumers using ML techniques. They developed a gradient boosting regression (GBR) based model to forecast the power demands of commercial buildings. In addition, they perform experiments on various datasets that are obtained from different locations of the United States. First, they exploit the data of New York city and the same forecasting model is implemented on the data of Atlanta city. Results validate the performance of the newly developed model. Another paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[118]</ref> considers a load forecasting problem in residential areas as well as in commercial buildings. A deep RNN is employed for medium to long term energy consumption forecasting. The datasets from commercial buildings of Salt Lake city, USA are exploited to perform simulations and a 3-layer MLP forecasting model is implemented to examine the efficiency of the developed forecasting model. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed deep RNN based model over MLP for load demand prediction of commercial buildings. However, 3-layer MLP shows efficacy in the forecasting of the residential load.</p><p>The research work presented in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[119]</ref> tackles the load forecasting problem of residential areas. Usually, volatility and uncertainty in household demand forecasting are considered the key issues. Traditional techniques are used to solve these issues in various ways such as customer classification, load aggregation, and spectral analysis. However, this paper adopts a mechanism to learn directly from uncertainties and develops a new forecasting algorithm, termed pooling-based deep RNN (PDRNN). It utilizes the load profiles of several consumers as a pool of inputs, enabling the model to address the over-fitting problem. Furthermore, it is claimed that it is the first attempt to develop a DL application for residential consumers. Extensive simulations have been performed and data of 920 smart-metered consumers from Ireland are exploited. Additionally, to check the performance of the newly developed model, authors have performed a comparison with other benchmarks, i.e., ARIMA, SVR, and classical deep-RNN. A comparative study shows the efficacy of the PDRNN forecasting model. Another research work <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[120]</ref> also adapts DL based methods for load forecasting. Specifically, a hybrid forecasting method is developed by combining the best features of CNN and K-means clustering. They used a large dataset obtained from the power grid, which is clustered into subsets using the K-means algorithm, and the obtained subsets are used to train the CNN. The authors also performed simulations for both seasons (summer and winter) to validate the productiveness of the proposed hybrid model and a comparative study is also taken into account, where several forecasting algorithms employing linear regression, linear regression + L-means, SVR, and CNN are considered. Results affirm the effectiveness of their hybrid CNN-K-means forecasting algorithm in terms of higher accuracy.</p><p>Xueheng et al. proposed a hybrid power demand forecasting algorithm that combines EMD and DBN <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[121]</ref>. To forecast the power demand, first, the historical load demand series are decomposed into multiple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and then a DBN containing two RBMs is opted to model each IMF. Eventually, the prediction results of all IMFs are combined by either weighted or unbiased summation to attain an aggregated output for power demand. Furthermore, they performed experiments to show the legitimacy of their proposed forecasting method by employing the datasets from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[122]</ref>. They utilized nine other forecasting methods as benchmarks for comparative purpose, i.e., persistence, SVR, ANN, DBN, random forest, EDBN, EMD-SVR, EMD-ANN, and EMD-RF.</p><p>The study presented in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[123]</ref> proposes a load and price forecasting method to balance electricity load demand and supply. For this purpose, a hybrid algorithm is developed on the bases of a multi-stage forecast engine (MFE) and dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DCWT). First, the signals enter the wavelet transform and then are filtered by a novel feature selection. Subsequently, the signals are forecasted by MSFE in 3 steps and then an intelligent algorithm is opted to enhance the forecast accuracy. Eventually, an improved fusion algorithm collects the outputs of MSFE. To check the effectiveness of their proposed forecasting method, extensive simulations have been performed using the datasets from the energy department of Australia and England. Various forecasting methods, like ARIMA, SVR, RBFNN, WT + RBFNN are also employed for comparative study.</p><p>Gabriel et al. also tackled the load forecasting problem in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[124]</ref> and proposed a load forecasting framework that built a wavenet ensemble for short term power demand forecasting. Firstly, data are transformed and normalized to remove trends, then an optimal time window is constructed and a subset of features is selected. Subsequently, the bootstrapping, cross-validation, simple mean, and median algorithms are employed for the ensemble aggregation of the wavenet learners. Finally, forecasted values are realized via a one-step-ahead strategy. The authors have considered different forecasting methods, such as MLP, single wavenet, and regression tree, for experiments and compared them with the proposed algorithm. In addition, they used real-time datasets from Global Energy Forecasting Competition, Italy to perform experiments.</p><p>Another energy demand forecasting problem for the residential community is taken into account by <ref type="bibr">Mujeeb et al. in Ref. [125]</ref>. They proposed a hybrid forecasting algorithm, namely deep LSTM (DLSTM) that combines the best qualities of LSTM and DNN. The proposed DLSTM uses the automatic feature learning mechanism from DNN and all other forecasting steps are performed by LSTM. To evaluate the newly proposed algorithm, they perform experiments by using the datasets of New York city. They forecast day-ahead and week-ahead power demand. Furthermore, MAPE and RMSE are computed to check the performance of proposed and benchmark algorithms.</p><p>The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[126]</ref> also consider the load forecasting problem and propose a solution for residential areas. An adaptive circular conditional expectation (ACCE) technique is developed based on circular analysis to define the sub-residuals operation schedules. Next, an adaptive linear model (LM) is opted to forecast the residual component demand by exploiting the results of the ACCE process at each time step. Finally, the forecast performance is evaluated as the normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) and a comparison is performed with auto-regressive model (AR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[127]</ref> and auto-regressive with exogenous input (ARX) <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[128]</ref> forecasting model to validate the ACCE method.</p><p>The Inception Time forecasting model, an ensemble of deep CNN, can be used for time-series forecasting. The fundamental building block of the inception model is known as an inception module, which comprises of bottleneck, convolutional, max pooling, and depth concatenation layers. The concept of inception module is adopted from image processing in which network architectures like AlexNet, GoogleNet, etc., are used for image classification or recognition. Recurrent Inspection CNN (RICNN) model is proposed for short-term electricity load forecasting in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[66]</ref>. In RICNN model, RNN is combined with 1-dimensional CNN network to learn the spatial and temporal representations of electricity load. The RNN learns the long-term and short-term temporal dependencies present in the electricity load time-series data. Then, the CNN learns the low-level (spatially adjacent local) and high-level (valleys and peaks) features of the electricity load time-series. The electricity consumption dataset of 3 large electricity distribution complexes of Korea electric power corporation (KEPCO) is utilized for building the RICNN model. This model outperforms the benchmark model MLP in terms of MAPE.</p><p>Ahmad et al. proposes a short-term load forecasting (STLF) method for industrial areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[129]</ref>. The primary objective of this work is to enhance forecast accuracy along with high convergence speed. For this purpose, the authors proposed a hybrid ANN that employees the mutual information (MI) for features selection, while enhanced differential evolution (DE) is exploited for error minimization. Consequently, execution time was reduced by 52.38% and 95.5% accuracy was recorded in simulation results, as compared to bi-level forecast strategy.</p><p>Many of these deep learning-based forecasting algorithms have successfully addressed the forecasting analysis and have outperformed the forecasting challenges of ML and NNs. There are a variety of issues related to the forecast study of the form of load, period, temperature, seasons, customer behavior, and holidays.

The quantity and quality of historical data have significant importance during training of large and complex architectures, as DL models have numerous parameters to be learned and configured. This challenge still remains open in EMSs, because unfortunately, unlike other research domains like image processing, natural language processing, and computer vision, good-quality labeled datasets are still lacking for energy management along with load/energy forecasting applications. The key reason behind this is that utility companies and service providers keep real-time and historical data confidential due to various security and privacy concerns. Since the data is usually gathered through sensors, several over issues also exist, such as duplication, mislabeling, and temporary loss of data streams. Hence, there is exigent need of integrated technologies for building intelligent systems in smart microgrids such as combining DL and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for data collection as well as a streamlining platform for data processing. Blockchain-enabled IoT technologies can also help with advanced DL applications in smart grid area. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 13</ref>.

Spatiotemporal prediction approaches are considered more accurate and feasible for future smart microgrid than the single-location techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[139]</ref>.

It is to be noted that owing to the mobile nature of above-mentioned technologies, prediction of demands or loads is becoming more challenging.

In order to comprehend the DL working, it is necessary to first understand uncertainty quantification. For instance, the DL methodology starts with the collection of more appropriate datasets, selection of an appropriate DL model based on performance goals, training the model by employing a labeled dataset, and optimization of various learning parameters that will help in achieving satisfactory performance. There exist multiple uncertainties involved in the DL steps, which need to be quantified.

However, there exist several sources of renewable energy other than solar and wind, for instance, hydro energy, geothermal energy, ocean energy, and bio energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>. Although ML-and DL-based methods can be applied in these energy sources, their applications for energy prediction are scarce. For example, ML and DL approaches have been employed for geothermal map generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[149]</ref>, site location modeling for geo thermal <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[150]</ref>, scheduling of hydropower plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[151]</ref>, sea-level variation forecasting for ocean energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[152]</ref>, output voltage forecasting in geothermal energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[153]</ref>, and density prediction in bio energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[154]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources leads to unreliable energy generation from renewable energy sources, which ultimately necessitate research regarding renewable energy forecasting. Reliable forecasting of solar and wind power can help in improving the quality of service and efficient power management. ML-and DL-based forecasting techniques are considered effective and efficient methodologies for energy forecasting that utilize historical data. In this survey, we performed comprehensive state-of-the-art literature review regarding energy and load forecasting using DL-based techniques. The scope of a set of forecasting models is reviewed in terms of energy types (i.e., wind energy and solar energy), building types (i.e., commercial and noncommercial buildings), and temporal granularities of forecasting (i.e., 5-min, 10-min, 15-min, 30-min, and hourly). Furthermore, the properties of the datasets that are used for training and testing forecasting models are also investigated, including data types (i.e., benchmark data, real-time data, and simulation data), dataset features (i.e., data origin, features related to indoor environmental conditions and outdoor weather conditions), dataset recording step (i.e., 10-min, 15-min, 30-min, and hourly), and dataset sizes (i.e., total time duration).

Each DL-based forecasting model has its own advantages and disadvantages in predicting wind energy, solar energy, and load forecasting; thus, it is difficult to determine which is the best among all the models. However, our findings suggest that for all the forecasting applications under consideration, hybrid DL algorithms achieve a high level of performance in terms of prediction accuracy. Moreover, hybrid DL schemes exhibit more tolerance to data incompleteness as compared to pure DNN-based DL. Despite the many advances in DL-based forecasting, a large set of challenges remain unresolved that motivate interesting future research directions, including DL with huge amount of data, lowering computational cost and complexity, spatiotemporal forecasting, mobility due to emerging applications, uncertainty quantification, and use of pruned DL models in smart microgrids.</p></div>
