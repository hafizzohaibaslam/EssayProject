			<abstract>
				<p>Time series forecasting has become a very intensive field of research, which is even increasing in recent years. Deep neural networks have proved to be powerful and are achieving high accuracy in many application fields. For these reasons, they are one of the most widely used methods of machine learning to solve problems dealing with big data nowadays. In this work, the time series forecasting problem is initially formulated along with its mathematical fundamentals. Then, the most common deep learning architectures that are currently being successfully applied to predict time series are described, highlighting their advantages and limitations. Particular attention is given to feed forward networks, recurrent neural networks (including Elman, long-short term memory, gated recurrent units, and bidirectional networks), and convolutional neural networks. Practical aspects, such as the setting of values for hyper-parameters and the choice of the most suitable frameworks, for the successful application of deep learning to time series are also provided and discussed. Several fruitful research fields in which the architectures analyzed have obtained a good performance are reviewed. As a result, research gaps have been identified in the literature for several domains of application, thus expecting to inspire new and better forms of knowledge.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Problem Definition</head><p>This section provides the time series definition (Time Series Definition section), along with a description of the main time series components (Time Series Components section). The mathematical formulation for the time series forecasting problem is introduced in the Mathematical Formulation section. Final remarks about the length of the time series can be found in Shortand Long-Time Series Forecasting section.</p><p>Time series definition A time series is defined as a sequence of values, chronologically ordered, and observed over time.

Methods based on robust statistics must be chosen to remove these values or, simply, to incorporate them into the model.</p><p>The rest of the article is structured as follows. The forecasting problem and mathematical formulation for time series can be found in the Problem Definition section. Deep-Learning Architectures section introduces the deep-learning architectures typically used in the context of time series forecasting. Practical Aspects section provides information about several practical aspects (including implementation, hyper-parameter tuning, or hardware resources) that must be considered when apSome of these issues can be handled natively by the used model, but if the data are collected irregularly, this should be accounted for in the model. In this survey, the time series preprocessing is out of scope, but please refer to this work for detailed information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>19</head><p>Time series components Time series are usually characterized by three components: trend, seasonality, and irregular components, also known as residuals.</p><p>20 Such components are described later:</p><p>1. Trend. It is the general movement that the time series exhibits during the observation period, without considering seasonality and irregularities. In some texts, this component is also known as long-term variation. Although there are different kinds of trends in time series, the most popular are linear, exponential, or parabolic ones. 2. Seasonality. This component identifies variations that occur at specific regular intervals and may provide useful information when time periods exhibit similar patterns. It integrates the effects reasonably stable along with the time, magnitude, and direction. Seasonality can be caused by several factors such as climate or economical cycles, or even festivities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Residuals. Once the trend and cyclic oscillations</head><p>have been calculated and removed, some residual values remain. These values can be, sometimes, high enough to mask the trend and the seasonality. In this case, the term outlier is used to refer these residuals, and robust statistics are usually applied to cope with them. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> These fluctuations can be of diverse origin, which makes the prediction almost impossible. However, if by any chance, this origin can be detected or modeled, they can be thought of precursors in trend changes.</p><p>Time series can be graphically represented. In particular, the x-axis identifies the time, whereas the y-axis identifies the values recorded at punctual time stamps (x t ). This representation allows the visual detection of the most highlighting features of a series, such as oscillations amplitude, existing seasons, and cycles or the existence of anomalous data or outliers. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> depicts an time series, x t , using an additive model with linear seasonality with constant frequency and amplitude over time, represented by the function sin(x); linear trend where changes over time are consistently made by the same amount, represented by the function 0:0213x; and residuals, represented by random numbers in the interval [0, 0:1].</p><p>A time series is an aggregate of these three components. Real-world time series present a meaningful irregular component and are not stationary (mean and variance are not constant over time), turning this component into the most challenging one to model. For this reason, to make accurate predictions for them is extremely difficult, and many forecasting classical methods try to decompose the target time series into these three components and make predictions for all of them separately.</p><p>The effectiveness of one technique or another is assessed according to its capability of forecasting this</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mathematical formulation</head><p>Time series models can be either univariate (one timedependent variable) or multivariate (more than one time-dependent variables). Although models may dramatically differ between a univariate and a multivariate system, the majority of the deep-learning models can handle indistinctly with both of them.</p><p>On the one hand, let y = y(t ?

The forecasting process consists of estimating the value of y(t ? 1), denoted by ^ y(t ? 1), with the aim of minimizing the error, which is typically represented as a function of y(t ? 1) ? ^ y(t ? 1). This prediction can be made also when the horizon of prediction, h, is greater than one, that is, when the objective is to predict the h next values after y(t), that is, y(t ? i), with i = 1, . . . , h.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Short-and long time series forecasting</head><p>Another key issue is the length of the time series. Depending on the number of samples, long-or short time series can be defined. It is well known that the Box-Jenkins' models do not work well for long time series mainly due to the time-consuming process of parameters optimization and to the inclusion of information, which is no longer useful to model the current samples.</p><p>been published in recent years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> These models make use of clusters of machines or GPUs to overcome the limitations described in the previous paragraphs.</p><p>Deep-learning models can deal with time series in a scalable way and provide accurate forecasts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> Ensemble learning can also be useful to forecast big data time series <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> or even methods based on well-established methods such as nearest neighbours <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> or pattern sequence similarity. How to deal with these issues is highly related to the purpose of the model. Flexible nonparametric models could be used, but this still assumes that the model structure will work over the whole period of the data, which is not always true. A better approach consists of allowing the model to vary over time. This can be done by either adjusting a parametric model with time-varying parameters or adjusting a nonparametric model with a time-based kernel. But if the goal is only to forecast a few observations, it is simpler to fit a model with the most recent samples and transforming the long time series into a short one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deep-Learning Architectures</head><p>This section provides a theoretical tour of deep learning for time series prediction in big data environments. First, a description of the most used architectures in the literature to predict time series is made. Then, a state-of-the-art analysis is carried out, where the deep-learning works and frameworks to deal with big data are described.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21</head><p>Although a preliminary approach to use a distributed ARIMA model has been recently published, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> it remains challenging to deal with such time series with classical forecasting methods. However, a number of machine-learning algorithms adapted to deal with ultra-long time series, or big data time series, have Deep feed forward neural network Deep feed forward neural networks (DFFNN), also called multi-layer perceptron, arose due to the inability of single-layer neural networks to learn certain functions. The architecture of a DFFNN is composed of an input layer, an output layer, and different hidden layers, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. In addition, each hidden layer has a certain number of neurons to be determined.</p><p>The relationships between the neurons of two consecutive layers are modeled by weights, which are calculated during the training phase of the network. In  TORRES ET AL particular, the weights are computed by minimizing a cost function by means of gradient descent optimization methods. Then, the back-propagation algorithm is used to calculate the gradient of the cost function. Once the weights are computed, the values of the output neurons of the network are obtained by using a feed-forward process defined by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">a l = g(W l l a a l ? 1 ? b a ),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where <ref type="formula">a</ref>   In time series forecasting, the rectified linear unit function is commonly used as activation function for all layers, except for the output layer to obtain the predicted values, which generally uses the hyperbolic tangent function (tanh).</p><p>For all network architectures, the values of some hyper-parameters have to be chosen in advance. These hyper-parameters, such as the number of layers and the number of neurons, define the network architecture, and other hyper-parameters, such as the learning rate, the momentum, and number of iterations or minibatch size, among others, have a great influence on the convergence of the gradient descend methods. The optimal choice of these hyper-parameters is important, as these values greatly influence the prediction results obtained by the network. The hyper-parameters will be discussed in more detail in the Hyper-Parameter Optimization section. and one output), and many to many (many inputs and outputs). The most common RNNs are many to one for classification problems or many to many for machine translation or time series forecasting for instance. In addition, for the case of a time series, the length of the input data sequence is usually different from the size of the output data sequence that usually is the number of samples to be predicted. A basic RNN architecture to address the forecasting of time series is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. x i and ^ x i are the actual and predicted values of the time series at time i, and h is the number of samples to be predicted, called prediction horizon.</p><p>The most widely used RNNs for time series forecasting are briefly described later.</p><p>Downloaded by Auckland University of from www.liebertpub.com at 04/27/21.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recurrent neural network</head><p>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are specifically designed to deal with sequential data such as sequences of words in problems related to machine translation, audio data in speech recognition, or time series in forecasting problems. All these problems present a common characteristic, which is that the data have a temporal dependency between them. Traditional feed-forward neural networks cannot take into account these dependencies, and RNNs arise precisely to address this problem.</p><p>Elman RNN. The Elman network (ENN) was the first RNN and it incorporated the t state of a hidden unit to make predictions in data sequences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> The ENN consists of a classical one-layer feed-forward network but the hidden layer is connected to a new layer, called context layer, using fixed weights equal to one, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref>. The main function of the neurons of this <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> Therefore, the input data in the architecture of a RNN are both past and current data. There are different types of architectures, depending on the number of data inputs and outputs in the network, such as one to one (one input and one output), one to many (one input and many outputs), many to one (many inputs context layer is to save a copy of the values of activation of the neurons of the hidden layer.

The ， and + operators mean an element-wise vectors multiplication and sum.</p><p>Long short-term memory. Standard basic RNNs suffer the vanishing gradient problem, which consists of the gradient decreasing as the number of layers increases. Indeed, for deep RNNs with a high number of layers, the gradient practically becomes null, preventing the learning of the network. For this reason, these networks have a short-term memory and do not obtain good results when dealing with long sequences that require memorizing all the information contained in the complete sequence. Long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent networks emerge to solve the vanishing gradient problem. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> For this purpose, LSTM uses three gates to keep longstanding relevant information and discard irrelevant information. These gates are G f forget gate, G u update gate, and G o output gate. G f decides what information should be thrown away or saved. A value close to 0 means that the past information is forgotten whereas a value close to 1 means that it remains. G u decides what new information ~ c t to use to update the c t memory state. Thus, c t is updated by using both G Gated recurrent units. Recurrent networks with gated recurrent units (GRU) are long-term memory networks such as LSTMs but they emerged in 2014 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> f and G u . Finally, G o decides which is the output value that will be the input of the next hidden unit.</p><p>The information of the a t ? 1 previous hidden unit and the information of the x t current input is passed through the r sigmoid activation function to compute all the gate values and through the tanh activation function to compute the ~ c t new information, which will be used to update. The equations defining an LSTM unit are:</p><p>as a simplification of LSTMs due to the high computational cost of the LSTM networks. GRU is one of the most commonly used versions that researchers have converged on and found to be robust and useful for many different problems. The use of gates in RNNs has made it possible to improve capturing of very long-range dependencies, making RNNs much more effective. The LSTM is more powerful and more effective since it has three gates instead of two, but the GRU is a simpler model and it is computationally faster as it only has two gates, G u update gate and G r relevance gate as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>. The G u gate will decide whether the c t memory state is or is not updated by using the ~ c t memory state candidate. The G r gate determines how relevant c t ? 1 is to compute the next candidate for c t , that is, ~ c t .

Bidirectional RNN. There are some problems, in the field of natural language processing (NLP) for instance, where to predict a value of a data sequence in a given instant of time, information from the sequence both before and after that instant is needed. Bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNNs) address this issue to solve this kind of problems. The main disadvantage of the BRNNs is that the entire data sequence is needed before the prediction can be made.</p><p>Standard networks compute the activation values for hidden units by using a unidirectional feed-forward process. However, in a BRNN, the prediction uses information from the past as well as information from the present and the future as input, using both forward and backward processing.</p><p>Thus, the prediction at time t, ^ x t , is obtained by using a g activation function applied to the corresponding weights with both the forward and backward activation at time t. That is:</p><p>Deep recurrent neural network. A deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) can be considered as an RNN with more than one layer, also called stacked RNN. The hidden units can be standard RNN, GRU or LSTM units, and it can be unidirectional or bidirectional as described in previous sections. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 8</ref> illustrates the architecture of a DRNN with three layers.</p><p>In general, a DRNN works quite well for time series forecasting, but its performance deteriorates when using very long data sequences as input. To address this issue, attention mechanisms can be incorporated into the model, being one of the most powerful ideas in deep learning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> An attention model allows a neural </p><formula xml:id="formula_17">^ x t = g(W x [a f t , a b t ] ? b x ),<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where W x and b x are the weights and bias and a   network to pay attention to only part of an input data sequence while it is generating the output. This attention is modeled by using weights, which are computed by a single-layer feed-forward neural network. Convolutional neural networks Convolutional neural networks (CNN) were presented in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> by Fukushima and are one of the most common architectures in image processing and computer vision. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> The CNNs have three kinds of layers: convolution, pooling, and fully connected. The main task of the convolution layers is the learning of the features from data input. For that, filters of a predefined size are applied to the data by using the convolution operation between matrices. The convolution is the sum of all element-wise products. The pooling reduces the size of input, speeding up the computing and preventing overfitting. The most popular pooling methods are average and max pooling, which summarize the values by using the mean or maximum value, respectively. Once the features have been extracted by the convolutional layers, the forecasting is carried out by using fully connected layers, also called dense layers, as in DFFNN. The input data for these last fully connected layers are the flattened features resulting of the convolutional and pooling layers. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> depicts the overall architecture of a CNN.</p><p>Recently, a variant of CNN, called temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> has emerged for data sequence, competing directly with DRNNs in terms of execution times and memory requirements.</p><p>The TCNs have the same architecture as a DFFNN but the values of activations for each layer are computed by using earlier values from the previous layer.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical aspects Implementation</head><p>The implementation of a multilayer perceptron is relatively simple. However, deep-learning models are more complex, and their implementation requires a high level of technical expertise and a considerable time investment to implement. For this reason, the profile of the deep-learning expert has become one of the most demanded nowadays. To make easier implementations and reduce the time needed to design and train a model, some companies have focused their work on developing frameworks that allow for the implementation, training and use of deep learning models.</p><p>The main idea of the deep-learning frameworks is to provide an interface that allows for the implementation of models without having to pay too much attention to the mathematical complexity behind them. There are several frameworks available in the literature. The choice of one or another will depend on several important factors, such as the type of architecture that can be implemented, support for distributed programming environments, or whether it can run on GPUs. In this sense, <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes the most widely used frameworks in the literature, where the term all includes the DFFNN, CNN, TCN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, or BRNN architectures, and CPU is a central processing unit. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows that the predominant programming language for developing deep-learning models is Python. In addition, most of the frameworks support distributed execution and the use of GPU's. Although the described frameworks facilitate the development of the models, some of them require too many lines of code to obtain a complete implementation. For this reason, high-level libraries based on the core of the frameworks have been developed, making programming even easier. Some examples of high-level libraries can be Keras, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> Sonnet, 51 Swift, or Gluon, 52 among others. The main advantage of using a highlevel-library is that the syntax can be reused for another base framework, in addition to facilitating its implementation. However, the lack of flexibility is the main disadvantage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hyper-parameter optimization</head><p>The combination of frameworks and high-levellibraries greatly facilitates the implementation of models. However, there is an important study gap: the model optimization. This optimization will determine the quality of the model, and it must be performed based on the adjustment of its hyper-parameters. In deep learning, there are two types of hyper-parameters: model parameters and optimization parameters. The model parameters must be adjusted in the model definition to obtain optimal performance. The optimization parameters are adjusted during the training phase of the model by using the dataset. Some of the most relevant hyper-parameters are described and categorized by network architecture in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. The number of hyper-parameters will depend on the network architecture to be used. In addition, the value of each one will be influenced by the characteristics of  the problem and the data. This makes the task of optimizing a model a challenge for the research community. Moreover, and taking into account the parameters described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>, an immense number of possible combinations can be deduced. For this reason, various metaheuristics and optimization strategies are used. According to the literature, there are several strategies to optimize a set of hyper-parameters for deep-learning models, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>. Thus, the hyper-parameter optimization methods can be classified into four major blocks:</p><p>1. Trial-error: This optimization method is based on varying each of the hyper-parameters manually. Therefore, this method implies a high time investment, having a relatively low computational cost and a low search space, because it requires the action of a user to modify the values manually each time a run is finished. Since in deep learning there are a large number of hyper-parameters and the values they can set are infinite, it is not advisable to use this optimization method. 2. Grid: The grid method explores the different possible combinations for a set of established hyperparameters. This method covers a high search space, although it has a high computational cost associated with it, which makes this method unviable to apply in deep learning, let alone in big data environments. 3. Random: Random search allows to cover a high search space, because infinite combinations of hyper-parameters can be generated. Within this group we can differentiate between totally random or guided search strategies, such as those based on metaheuristics. Examples of this type of searches are the genetic algorithms, 68,69 particle swarm optimization, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">70</ref> or neuroevolution of augmenting topologies 71 algorithms, among others. The wide search range, added to the medium cost involved in this search strategy, makes it one of the best methods for optimizing deep-learning models. In addition, new hyper-parameters optimization metaheuristics are being published, such as the bioinspired model in the propagation of COVID-19 presented by the authors in Ref.    few are designed specifically for the optimization of deep-learning model hyper-parameters, being also compatible with the frameworks and high-level libraries described in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> summarizes a set of libraries for the optimization of hyper-parameters in deeplearning models, classifying them by search strategies, support to distributed computing, programming language, and compatible framework from Table 1. Note that it is not known whether HPOLib supports distributed computing or in which frameworks it works.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hardware performance</head><p>One of the most important decisions a researcher must make is to determine the physical resources needed to ensure that deep-learning algorithms will find accurate models. Hence, this section overviews different hardware infrastructures typically used for deep-learning contexts, given its increasing demand for better and more sophisticated hardware. Although a CPU can be used to execute deep-learning algorithms, the intensive computational requirements usually make the CPU physical resources insufficient (scalar architecture). For this reason, three different hardware architectures are typically used for mining information with deep-learning frameworks: GPU, tensor processing unit (TPU), and intelligence processing unit (IPU).</p><p>A GPU is a co-processor allocated in a CPU that is specifically designed to handle graphics in computing environments. The GPUs can have hundreds or even thousands of more cores than a CPU, but running at lower speeds. The GPUs achieve high data parallelism with single instructions, multiple data architecture and play an important role in the current artificial intelligence domain, with a wide variety of applications.</p><p>The first generation of TPUs was introduced in 2016, at the Google I/O Conference and they were specifically designed to run already trained neural networks. The TPUs are custom application-specific integrated circuits built specifically for machine learning. Compared with GPUs (frequently used for the same tasks since 2016), TPUs are implicitly designed for a larger volume of reduced precision calculation (e.g., from 8 bits of precision) and lack of hardware for rasterization/ texture mapping. The term was coined for a specific chip designed for Google's TensorFlow framework. Generally speaking, TPUs have less accuracy compared with the computations performed on a normal CPU or GPU, but it is sufficient for the calculations they have to perform (an individual TPU can process more than 100 millions of pictures per day). Moreover, TPUs are highly optimized for large batches and CNNs and have the highest training throughput.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>79</head><p>The IPU is completely different from today's CPU and GPU processors. It is a highly flexible, easy-to-use, parallel processor that has been designed from the ground up to deliver state-of-the-art performance on current machinelearning models. But more importantly, the IPU has been designed to allow new and emerging machine intelligence workloads to be realized. The IPU delivers much better arithmetic efficiency on small batch sizes for both training and inference, which results in faster model convergence in training, models that generalize better, the ability to parallelize over many more IPU processors to reduce training time for a given batch size, and also delivers much higher throughput at lower latencies for inference. Another interesting feature is its lower power consumption compared with GPUs or TPUs (up to 20% less). <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref> summarizes the properties of the processing units explored in this section. Note that the performance is measured in flops and the cost in USD.</p><p>Downloaded by Auckland University of from www.liebertpub.com at 04/27/21. For personal use only. Note that for TPUs cloud services are available for a price starting at 4.50 USD per hour (retrieved in March 2020).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applications</head><p>To motivate the relevance of the time series prediction problem, an analysis of the state of the art has been carried out by classifying the deep-learning research works by application domain (such as energy and fuels, image and video, finance, environment, industry, or health) and the most widespread network architectures used (ENN, LSTM, GRU, BRNN, DFFNN, CNN, or TCN). A summary on the works reviewed can be found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 6</ref>. An overview of the items for each application domain is made in the following paragraphs, to highlight the goals reached for each method and field: tion of LSTM to forecast oil production. Hybrid architectures have been also used in this research field, for example, to forecast the price of carbon, <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">102</ref> the price of energy in electricity markets, 101 energy consumption, <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">103</ref> or solar power generation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">105</ref> 1. Energy and fuels: With the increasing use of renewable energies, accurate estimates are needed to improve power system planning and operating. Many techniques have been used to make predictions, including deep learning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">195</ref> Reviewing the literature in the past few years, it can be concluded that the vast majority of deep-learning architectures are suitable to this application area.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="16">TORRES ET AL</head><p>3. Financial: Financial analysis has been a challenging issue for decades. Therefore, there are many research works related to this application area, as described in <ref type="bibr">Ref. 198</ref> In addition, various architectures such as CNN, <ref type="bibr">124-126 DNN, 123 GRU, 122</ref> or LSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">118,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">119</ref> have been used.

Environmental: Environmental data analysis is one of the most popular areas for the scientific community. Many of these works are also based on the application of deep-learning techniques to forecast time series. The authors in Ref. 150 applied CNN and LSTM to forecast wind speed or temperature by using meteorological data from Beijing, China. Other authors focused on a single specific variable. For instance, the authors used TCN, GRU, ENN, BRNN, and LSTM architectures to forecast information related to wind in. <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">134,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">136,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">137,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">146,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">147,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">149,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">155</ref> Water quality and demand were also predicted by using <ref type="bibr">TCN and ENN in Refs. 140,153</ref> An application of LSTMbased neural networks for correlated time series prediction was also proposed by <ref type="bibr">Wan et al. 143</ref> Further, carbon dioxide emissions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">139</ref> flood, 143 conducted a comprehensive study of time series prediction models in health care diagnosis and prognosis with a focus on cardiovascular disease. Instead, it is usual to apply convolution-based architectures or implement hybrid models. For example, the authors used CNN to accelerate the computation for magnetic resonance fingerprinting in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">175</ref> CNN was also used to monitoring the sleep stage in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">176</ref> for detecting premature problems as ventricular contractions <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">174</ref> or to forecast the Sepsis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">180</ref> In Ref. 179 the authors used a backpropagation network to forecast the incidence rate of pneumonia.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Deep learning has proven to be one of the most powerful machine-learning techniques for solving complex problems dealing with big data. Most of the data mainly generated through smart devices are time series nowadays, and their prediction is one of the most frequent and current problems in almost all research areas. Thus, these two topics have been jointly analyzed in this survey to provide an overview of deep-learning techniques applied to time series forecasting. First, the most used deep-learning architectures for time series data in the past years have been described, with special emphasis on important practical aspects that can have a great influence on the reported results. In particular, it has placed focus on the search for hyper-parameters, the frameworks for deployment of the different architectures, and the existing hardware to lighten the hard training of the proposed network architectures. Second, a study of the deep neural networks used to predict time series in different application domains has been carried out in this survey, with the aim of providing a good comparative framework to be used in future works and to show which architectures have not been sufficiently tested in some applications.</p></div>
