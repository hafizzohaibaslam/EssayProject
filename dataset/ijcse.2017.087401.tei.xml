			<abstract>
				<p>The new generation of social networks contains billions of nodes and edges. Managing and mining this data is a new academic and industrial challenge. Influence maximization is the problem of finding a set of nodes in a social network that result in the highest amount of influence diffusion. Many research works have been developed, which focus exclusively on the efficiency of algorithms, but overlook some features of social network data such as time sensitivity and the practicality in a large scale. Furthermore, the new era of &apos;big data&apos; is changing dramatically right before our eyes-the increase of big data growth gives all researchers many challenges as well as opportunities. This paper proposes two new models TIC and TLT and considers the time constraint during the influence spreading process in practice. Empirical studies on different synthetic and real large scale social networks demonstrate that our models together with solutions on both Hadoop and Spark platforms are more practical as well as providing a regulatory mechanism for enhancing influence maximization. Not only that but also outperforming most existing alternative algorithms.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>As the internet develops, the increasing popularity of many online social network sites <ref type="bibr">(Facebook, Google+ and Twitter, etc.</ref>) enables us to investigate large-scale social networks in a close view. However, we are facing challenges at all levels ranging from infrastructures to programming models for managing and mining large graphs.</p><p>Motivated by applications such as personalised recommendations, online advertising and microblog marketing, the study of influence diffusion and maximization attracts more and more attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Han et al., 2016a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Han et al., , 2016b</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Domingos and Richardson (2001)</ref> introduced the problem of identifying influential customs in the marketing campaign as a learning problem first. After that, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kempe et al. (2003)</ref> studied the influence maximization problem and proposed two primary information diffusion models, namely the independent cascade (IC) model and the linear threshold (IT) model.</p><p>In both of the models, the input is a network with nodes and weighted edges. Each node is either active or inactive. The possibility of one node becoming active increases monotonically with the number of its active neighbours. If one node becomes active, it will never be inactive again. This assumption is coming from real life observation. If we consider the influence diffusion process, let us look at the following example. One customer Mary just bought the latest iPhone 6S and posted one status on her Facebook page as 'iPhone 6S is great, get one, you will never regret!'. When her friend Mike on Facebook got this message and trusted her, then he could directly purchase one of his own. We naturally consider this process as Mary influencing Mike, as well as Mike is influenced (activated), his status will keep active (he has already purchased the device) and might continue to influence others through social media.</p><p>Different users could have different levels of susceptibility; this characteristic was modelled as the probability of each edge between different users in the network in our model. In the IC model, the beginning moment is denoted as time t 0 , nodes with active status perform as 'seeds' in the network. These nodes are considered contagious. A node u has one chance of influencing its inactive neighbour v with probability p u,v , which represents the ability of the influence spreading from u to v. If u succeeds in this attempt, node v becomes active at time t 1 , otherwise, u will not try to influence node v anymore. This process will continue until no new node becomes active in the network. There is also the same set of seed nodes in the LT model as there is in the IC model. Whether a node v will be influenced is determined by the sum of the weight of</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ) , 1 , i N v u v p ¡Æ such</formula><p>that the sum of all the incoming weights to v is less than or equal to 1. {u 1 , u 2 , ¡­, u i } ¡Ê N(v), where {u 1 , u 2 , ¡­, u i } are v's neighbours, and N(v) is v's neighbour set. In each time stamp, node v selects a random threshold ¦È v uniformly from <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>. If the sum of weight from all the active neighbours of an inactive node v is more than ¦È v , v becomes active at the next time stamp, otherwise, keep inactive. This process also repeats as well as IC to the end until no new node becomes active anymore. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kempe et al. (2003)</ref> first formulated influence maximization as a discrete optimisation problem. Considering a social network as a graph G = (V, E, p), where V and E is the set of vertices and edges with size |V| and |E|, and p: E ¡ú (0, 1] is the function assigning each edge e ¡Ê E a probability p(e). Choose an influence diffusion model <ref type="bibr">(IC or LT)</ref> and an initial active seed set S ? V, the expectation of the active node's number at the end of the process is the expected diffusion spread of S, denoted as ¦Ä m (S). Then the influence maximization problem is defined as follows: A directed social graph G = (V, E, p), find the best seed set S to maximise the ¦Ä m (S).</p><p>However, in both the IC and IT models, the evolution and influence are diffused in unlimited time. The only termination condition is no new active node appears, but this assumption is not completely supported by the facts in real social networks. Information always depends on timeliness, such as the advertisement of some products is limited to just in a period of time, and the news is only meaningful during a particular period, influence diffusion in general is stopped before the original stop condition in IC and LT. Based on observations above, we employ a time constraint ¦Ó to strengthen the classical models, then propose 'time constraint IC model (TIC)' and 'time constraint LT model (TLT)', which restrict the output and let the algorithm aim at maximising the influence within the threshold ¦Ó time.</p><p>On the other hand, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al. (2010b)</ref>, the influence diffusion processing itself in IC and LT are '#P-Hard' problems, and both IC and LT in their original paper are proved to be 'NP-Hard' problems. These facts told us that developing an exact algorithm to solve this problem is impossible if NP ¡Ù P. And the simulation processing of the model itself is also very time consuming. Even though several heuristic algorithms have been developed recently, it is hard to give a theoretical guarantee. As a result, the existing works cannot handle the real large-scale network as efficiently as we illustrated.</p><p>Additionally, 'big data' is hinting at a future in which we could compute in a relatively transparent environment (such as a cluster) but local-machine-computation is not the only new buzzword after Web 2.0. As probably the most notable big data frameworks Hadoop and Spark provide us a potential solutions for large-scale networks to solve the influence maximization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fazio et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lam et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Liao et al., 2013)</ref>. Hadoop is an Apache project providing a distributed file system and a framework for the analysis and transformation of very large datasets using the MapReduce ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jeffrey and Ghemawat, 2008)</ref> paradigm. Hadoop is available via the Apache open source license, which provided us an opportunity to develop a big data environment based on Hadoop for our influence maximization problem. As well as Hadoop, Spark is another open source Apache project. Different from the traditional map reduce, Spark approaches data processing mainly in memory instead of a hard drive space.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, the input of our problem is a social network with a huge number of nodes and edges between nodes. Each edge has a probability (weight) representing the influence between the nodes pair, by processing the influence maximization on both Hadoop and Spark environments, the process outputs a seed set S with size k, which can maximise influence when followed by our influence model.</p><p>In this paper, we have the contribution below:</p><p>? First, we introduce two new influence maximization models with time-constraint properties. We give the formal definition of the new models and analyse their complexity.</p><p>? Then, we propose the theoretical proof result of the proper monotonicity and submodularity which give us the possibility of using an efficient greedy algorithm. We will also give the theoretical analysis of the approximation ratio of our algorithm.</p><p>? Thirdly, based on the new model and efficient algorithm we proposed, the Hadoop-based cloud computing environment is used to deploy our experimental dataset and algorithm. Considering the specific problem, we also suggest new strategies to optimise the Hadoop-based algorithm.</p><p>? Last but not the least, by using both large-scale simulation data and real social networks data, we implement the algorithm in a Hadoop-based cloud environment and evaluate the large-scale data by several efficient distributed strategies.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the related works. Section 3 presents the preliminaries and problem definition. Section 4 illustrates the algorithm and theoretical analysis. Evaluation results based on real and synthetic datasets are shown in Section 5. Section 6 concludes our paper. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> Influence maximization processing in cloud environment (see online version for colours)</p><p>In 2003, Kempe et al. initially proposed several influence diffusion models and provided the greedy approximation algorithm. Many researchers studied efficient optimisations and scalable heuristics for the influence maximization problem in different perspectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kimura et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Li et al., 2011</ref>). Under both the IC and LT influence diffusion models which were proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kempe et al. (2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kempe et al. et al. (2003)</ref> showed that finding the maximization problem is NP-Hard which cannot be solved in polynomial time. They also showed that the function ¦Ä m (S) is monotone and submodular. Monotonicity means that as the set of activated nodes grows, the chance of a node getting activated would not decrease ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Han et al., 2010)</ref>. Submodularity says that the probability of an active node to activate some other inactive node does not increase if more nodes have already attempted to activate this node. According to these two properties, the influence maximization problem can be approximated by a simple greedy Algorithm 1, and this algorithm has a theoretical guarantee of the approximate ratio (1 -1 / e). Based on this important result, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Leskovec et al. (2007)</ref> proposed a 700 times faster greedy algorithm which is based on a 'lazy-forward' optimisation when selecting new seeds. Although Leskovec's algorithm is much better than Algorithm 1, their method also faces serious scalability problems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chen et al. (2009)</ref> improved the efficiency of the greedy algorithm and proposed a new degree-based heuristic to solve this problem. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chen et al. (2010a)</ref> also proposed scalable heuristics to estimate the influence diffusion maximization problem under the IC model and the LT model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al., 2010b</ref>). Besides the basic IC and LT models, the topic-aware influence propagation models can also be considered as an important complement which studies the social influence from a topic modelling perspective ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Nicola et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jie et al., 2009)</ref>. After many works appeared to solve the influence maximization problem, one very important previous problem resurfaced, which is how to evaluate the probability between each pair of nodes in the real network ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wu and Shen, 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Han et al. (2014)</ref> proposed one method to model the uncertainty of the network which considers the weight on each edge with all the 'possible world' and calculate the result by sampling techniques. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kimura et al. (2010)</ref> first proposed a learning-based method for extracting influential nodes on a social network. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Goyal et al. (2010)</ref> also considered this problem and proposed their algorithm to learn probability in the social networks. Then, they presented a data-based approximate algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Goyal et al., 2011</ref>) which kept the same approximate ratio guarantee ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Long and Hu, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Li et al. (2015)</ref> addressed the problem of finding densely connected subgraphs that satisfy the query conditions considering the influence of a community in a network. However, their method is based on the concept of k-core, which is not an influence diffusion expectation model but a network structure model. This kind of model could not provide influence expectation measures which means it does not completely follow the information diffusion process ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Saito et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Teng et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Li et al., 2016)</ref>. This has been proven and verified in other experiments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cha et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rossi et al., 2013</ref>) to some extent. On the other hand, blocking maximization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">He et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">He et al., 2015</ref>) in social networks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zhang et al., 2016)</ref> can also be considered in several different models. This perspective can support a lot of important applications such as protecting rumours, reducing terrorist information attacks et al., or the influence can also have a totally opposite effect on the social network. We still, however, have not seen any results concerning both the influence spread with a time constraint and an influence decaying process. Furthermore, only single machine implementation struggles to satisfy the request from the big data era. Different from previous related works, we proposed a time constraining model with influence decay to catch the main feature of influence in real life. And we also deploy our models and algorithms to the up-to-date platform for further work reference.</p></div>

Otherwise, u i will not try to influence v anymore. The objective is to maximise the influence function ¦Ä(S * ) which is the expected number of influenced nodes at the end of the propagation.

Apache Spark's GraphX version 1.5.2 in Python and Apache Hadoop's Giraph version 2.0 in Java are implemented to deploy in the cluster. (Detail of nodes in cluster could be found in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). ? Small-world graphs: the small-world network model is a classical model following the small-world features according to 'small-world' ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Watts and Strogatz, 1998)</ref>. This model is referred to as Syn-SmallWord. ? Kronecker graphs: this model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Leskovec et al. (2005)</ref> generates a network in a natural way. The networks grow from five initial nodes and then Kronecker's idea is repeatedly applied to expand the network. This model is referred to as Syn-Kronecker. Based on the initial networks generated from the above models, we dynamically change each network based on the idea proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barab¨¢si and Albert (1999)</ref>. Since we have multiple synthetic networks in the experiments, the average summary of ten networks' statistic features has been used instead. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, we generate two scales [small (S) and large (L)] of networks for both models with a time stamp length of 50 and 100, respectively.

By default, we test the two greedy algorithms GA and TGA corresponding to model IC and TIC. As show in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref>, we test the change by the size of network under Kronecker model (the small world model presents a similar result), when the network size increase, the different between our TIC model and IC model became larger. This trend is resulting from TIC model consider the time constraint and influence decay during the propagation. Also, when the network size was increased, the propagation scope increased, but limited by the time and influence damping, the number of influenced nodes was also decreased.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref> Comparison between IC and TIC with network size increase (see online version for colours) <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> Influenced nodes comparison on small size synthetic data (see online version for colours) <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> Comparison between IC and TIC in Amazon co-purchase data (see online version for colours) <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> Influenced nodes comparison on large size synthetic data (see online version for colours) <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> Comparison between IC and TIC in other real social networks (see online version for colours) <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> Running time comparison between IC and TIC (see online version for colours) <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> Running time comparison between IC and TIC on large size synthetic data (see online version for colours) <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> Running time comparison between single machine and cluster under small-world (see online version for colours) since the IC and LT are the ideal assumed models, our models do describe the influence process in a more practical way than the classical ones.</p><p>Since the result of IC and LT present a very similar result, limited by space, we mainly just show IC's result.</p><p>The first advantage of our model is that it captures the real life attributes of influence and models them. The second advantage is our model could end the influence process limited by time. The time constraint and influence decay could end the iteration in advance, which is also speeding up the algorithm running. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, the other model, TIC, could apparently save more time to find out the most influential nodes in the two scales networks.</p><p>All experiments above show the features and advantages of our model. But if one considers the running time for either networks or either model, although our model TIC could outperform the classical IC with the greedy algorithm, the running time is hard to be satisfied and if the size of data increases further, it is very hard to finish in a reasonable time.</p><p>Next, we implement model IC and TIC in the cluster (Hadoop) under both small-world and Kronecker with greedy algorithms. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 11</ref>, apparently that cluster could achieve much better performance. Later in this section, we will show more results and comparisons between Hadoop and Spark. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 12</ref> is the comparison of number of influenced nodes between the two algorithms in single machine and cluster under Kronecker. Actually, the only difference between one algorithm on both single machine and cluster is the performance. Implementation of the same algorithm with different platforms does not affect the quality of the result. Thus, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 12</ref>, there is no difference between single machine and cluster in terms of number of influence nodes. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, we can get that the algorithm of IC can influence more nodes than our new model TIC because our new model considers the time constraint and the probability decay process. Even though, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 13</ref> Comparison among of algorithm GA(IC), TGA(TIC), and TDDA(TIC) (see online version for colours)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Real world data experiment</head><p>Figure 4 and <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> show the two real social networks match the analysis of our theory. But different networks have different distributions and topologies, in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, different networks show different changing trends. To compare the performance of different big data frameworks, we implement algorithm GA, TGA, and TDDA to our largest real world network Amazon(A3) with 410,236 nodes and 3356,824 edges on both Hadoop and Spark, we set the size of seed set k as 50. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 13</ref>, the performance on Spark is much better than Hadoop. This result is based on the different mechanism of Hadoop and Spark. Spark basically is a memory-based framework for massive computation. Even though, performance of Hadoop is still much better than single machine. The reason our algorithm TDDA in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 13</ref> performs better than the other two greedy algorithms is because TDDA is a heuristic algorithm with quite lower computation complexity.</p><p>Overall, the experiment shows that our model and algorithm match the theoretical result we proposed and we have tested the performance of different big data platforms on both synthetic data and real world data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>This paper presents two new models TIC and TLT which extend the practicality of the classical IC and LT models for influence maximization. The theoretical analysis shows that the two new models we propose both follow monotonicity and submodularity which can help us to design simple greedy algorithms with a guaranteed approximate ratio of (1 -1 / e). Both the simulation and real social network data implementations on a Hadoop-based environment show that our new algorithm can solve the problem efficiently and effectively.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, i u v p on each neighbour u i , such that the weight of any of the incoming weights from u i to v is less or equal to 1.
