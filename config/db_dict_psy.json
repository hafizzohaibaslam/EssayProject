            "details": "n. behavior aimed at harming others physically or psychologically. It can be distinguished from anger in that anger is oriented at overcoming the target but not necessarily through harm or destruction. When such behavior is purposively performed with the primary goal of intentional injury or destruction, it is termed hostile aggression. Other types of aggression are less deliberately damaging and may be instrumentally motivated (proactive) or affectively motivated (reactive). Instrumental aggression involves an action carried out principally to achieve another goal, such as acquiring a desired resource. Affective aggression involves an emotional response that tends to be targeted toward the perceived source of the distress but may be displaced onto other people or objects if the disturbing agent cannot be attacked (see displaced aggression). In the classical psychoanalytic theory of Sigmund Freud, the aggressive impulse is innate and derived from the death instinct, but many non-Freudian psychoanalysts and most nonpsychoanalytically oriented psychologists view it as socially learned or as a reaction to frustration (see frustration–aggression hypothesis). See also pathological aggression. Aggression among nonhuman animals also exists, involving direct physical attack by one on another or the threat of such attack. Over the years, different researchers have identified different types of animal aggression based on such considerations as the members involved (e.g., intraspecific or interspecific), the apparent intent (e.g., offensive or defensive), or the stimuli eliciting them. One of the most influential classification schemes has been that proposed in 1968 by U.S. physiological psychologist Kenneth Evan Moyer (1919–2006). It describes predatory aggression to obtain food and the converse antipredatory aggression, territorial aggression to repel intruders from an area, intermale aggression against a competitor, fear-induced aggression, irritable aggression in response to pain or deprivation of an item required for survival, sexual aggression to secure mates, maternal aggression to protect young offspring, and instrumental aggression.

It is actually more pronoradrenergic than serotonergic, and it also has significant antihistamine, anticholinergic, and adrenoreceptor-blocking activity (producing adverse side effects). It is an effective antidepressant, but its side effects and toxicity in overdose have led to a decline in its use in favor of the SSRIs and other agents. Although still used as an antidepressant, amitriptyline is no longer considered first-line medication and is more likely to be employed in low doses for chronic pain management or the prevention of migraine.

It was occasionally used to conduct interviews (Amytal interviews) designed to elicit unconscious material from patients, as well as information that was consciously withheld. Such interviews were also used in attempting to distinguish between patients who were malingering and those who had a bona fide conversion disorder.

The effect is a prolonged state of arousal and relief from feelings of fatigue (see CNS stimulant). Amphetamines were introduced in 1932 for a variety of clinical uses. During World War II, they were widely dispensed to combat soldiers to enable them to remain alert for periods of up to 60 hours. Tolerance develops progressively with continued use until the individual reaches a point of exhaustion and sleeps continuously for several days. Amphetamine abuse can result in dependence and a well-defined state of psychosis (see amphetamine dependence; amphetamine-induced psychotic disorder). Although widely used in the past for weight loss, relief of depression, and other indications, modern use of amphetamines is more circumscribed because of their adverse effects. They are now used mainly in short- and long-acting preparations to manage symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and to treat certain cases of severe depression or narcolepsy, and they still maintain a military use in the management of fatigue. Amphetamines include amphetamine itself (the prototype), dextroamphetamine, and methamphetamine. Related drugs, with a similar mode of action but different molecular structure, include methylphenidate. In addition, some forms and derivatives (including DOM, MDA, and MDMA) have been manufactured as recreational hallucinogenic drugs."

            "details": "n. any drug administered in the treatment of depression. Most antidepressants work by increasing the availability of monoamine neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, serotonin, or dopamine, although they do so by different routes. The monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) work by inhibiting monoamine oxidase, one of the principal enzymes that metabolize these neurotransmitters. Most of the other antidepressants, including the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (see SSRI), inhibit the reuptake of serotonin or norepinephrine (and to a much lesser degree dopamine) into the presynaptic neuron. Either process leaves more of the neurotransmitter free to bind with postsynaptic receptors, initiating a series of events in the postsynaptic neuron that is thought to produce the actual therapeutic effect. In 2007, a boxed warning was added to the labeling of all antidepressants, stating that the risk of suicidal thinking and actual suicide increased in children, adolescents, and young adults taking antidepressants versus those taking placebo in short-term studies of major depressive disorder and that, since depression itself is associated with an increased suicide risk, all patients newly on antidepressant medications should be monitored appropriately."

Antipsychiatrists contested the scientific and practical validity of psychiatry and radically opposed what they understood as a hospital-centered medical specialty legally empowered to treat and institutionalize individuals with mental disorders. Indeed, many antipsychiatrists argued against the very existence of mental disorders themselves, advancing the notion that they are not illnesses at all but rather alternative ways of behaving that alarm people.

Common causes of damage include stroke, brain tumors, and cortical degenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease). Traditionally, a distinction has been made between expressive and receptive forms of aphasia, whereby individuals with the former primarily have difficulty producing spoken and written language and those with the latter primarily have difficulty comprehending spoken and written language. A more contemporary distinction, however, is commonly made between fluent aphasias, characterized by plentiful verbal output consisting of well-articulated, easily produced, but inappropriate or meaningless utterances of relatively normal length and prosody (rhythm and intonation), and nonfluent aphasias, characterized by sparse, effortful utterances of short phrase length and disrupted prosody. Fluent aphasias are associated with posterior lesions that spare cortical regions critical for motor control of speech, whereas nonfluent aphasias are associated with anterior lesions that compromise motor and premotor cortical regions involved in speech production. Numerous types of aphasia exist, with eight classically identified: anomic aphasia, Broca’s aphasia, conduction aphasia, global aphasia, mixed transcortical aphasia, transcortical motor aphasia, transcortical sensory aphasia, and Wernicke’s aphasia. Also (but much less preferably) called dysphasia. —aphasic adj."

Although Aristotle cited some of these laws (similarity, difference, contiguity in time or space, etc.), the theory was first stated systematically by Thomas Hobbes, who held that all knowledge is compounded from relatively simple sense impressions. The laws and applications of association were later developed by John Locke and other members of the British empiricist school (see empiricism), notably George Berkeley, David Hume, David Hartley, James Mill, and John Stuart Mill. Although the approach taken by such thinkers was relatively static and nonexperimental, there are echoes of associationism in much historical and contemporary psychology. Most importantly, associationism has been invoked to explain the pairing of stimuli and responses. As such, it is a fundamental assumption of modern learning theory and all behaviorist approaches (see behaviorism). Also called British associationism."

Because it has been presumed that human beings do not have an infinite capacity to attend to everything—focusing on certain items at the expense of others—much of the research in this field has been devoted to discerning which factors influence attention and to understanding the neural mechanisms that are involved in the selective processing of information. For example, past experience affects perceptual experience (we notice things that have meaning for us), and some activities (e.g., reading) require conscious participation (i.e., voluntary attention). However, attention can also be captured (i.e., directed involuntarily) by qualities of stimuli in the environment, such as intensity, movement, repetition, contrast, and novelty.

Barbiturates are commonly categorized according to their rates of action (including onset of effect, absorption, and excretion) as long acting, intermediate acting, short acting, or ultrashort acting. Their use became common in the 1930s, but they were rapidly supplanted in the 1970s by the benzodiazepines, which lack the lethality associated with overdose of the barbiturates. The group includes amobarbital, butabarbital, pentobarbital, phenobarbital, primidone, and thiopental, among others. See sedative, hypnotic, and anxiolytic drug. The prototype of the group, barbital, was introduced into medical practice in 1903."

Watson, based on the study of objective, observable facts rather than subjective, qualitative processes, such as feelings, motives, and consciousness. To make psychology a naturalistic science, Watson proposed to limit it to quantitative events, such as stimulus–response relationships, effects of conditioning, physiological processes, and a study of human and animal behavior, all of which can best be investigated through laboratory experiments that yield objective measures under controlled conditions. Historically, behaviorists held that mind was not a proper topic for scientific study since mental events are subjective and not independently verifiable. With its emphasis on activity as an adaptive function, behaviorism is seen as an outgrowth of functionalism.

The term is roughly synonymous with Dasein, the term used by German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889–1976). The word being is meant to emphasize that human existence is an activity more than a state or condition. Similarly, world is meant to convey a much richer and more meaningful ground for human life than would be conveyed by a more sterile term, such as environment. Being-in-the-world is by its very nature oriented toward meaning and growth; while it characterizes the type of being of all humans, it is also unique for every person and can be seen to be offering an explanation of what in other psychological traditions might be called identity or self.

In 1984, U.S. biologist Edward O. Wilson (1929– ) elaborated on the concept to develop the biophilia hypothesis, stating that humans have genetically based, evolutionarily determined attractions to specific landscapes and natural elements that create a propensity to affiliate with other living organisms. The hypothesis also holds that this enmeshment with nature plays an essential role in human cognitive, social, and emotional processes.

Precise effects vary with the amount ingested and the tolerance of the individual. Moderate doses produce an improved flow of thought and clearness of ideas, together with increased respiratory and vasomotor activity; large doses may cause caffeine intoxication and substance-induced anxiety disorder. Because of its stimulant effects, caffeine is used in wake-promoting agents and in certain analgesics and cold remedies containing ingredients that usually cause drowsiness.

The principal psychoactive agent in these plants, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), is concentrated in the resin, most of which is in the plants’ flowering tops. When smoked, THC is rapidly absorbed into the blood and almost immediately distributed to the brain, causing the rapid onset of subjective effects that last 2 to 3 hours. These effects include a sense of euphoria or well-being, easy laughter, perceptual distortions, impairment of concentration and short-term memory, and craving for food. Adverse effects of anxiety or panic are not uncommon, and hallucinations may occur with high doses (see also cannabis-induced psychotic disorder; cannabis intoxication). Tolerance to the effects of THC develops with repeated use, and a withdrawal syndrome has been identified. The most potent marijuana preparation is hashish, which consists of pure resin. A less potent preparation is sinsemilla, also called ganja; it is made from the plants’ flowering tops. The weakest preparation is bhang. Also called hemp."

Many ideas and assumptions influential in psychology can be traced back to Descartes, including the notion of a rational self capable of knowing truth, the contention that the most trustworthy knowledge is of the contents of one’s own mind, and the idea that the deductive methods that have been successful in producing certainty in mathematics can be applied to produce equally valid knowledge in other fields of human endeavor. Of particular importance to the development of psychology are Descartes’ understanding of the ego (see Cartesian self) and his attempt to explain the relation of the mind to the body (see Cartesian dualism).

Once established, the stimulus for that response becomes a conditioned reinforcer that is used to reinforce the next-to-last response in the chain; this stimulus is then used to reinforce another response. The chain is thus taught backward, one response at a time. In forward chaining, the chain is taught by reinforcing the first step in the sequence, then the second, and so on until the entire sequence is learned. Also called behavior chaining."

Developed in 1957 and in clinical use in the early 1960s, it became one of the most heavily prescribed medications ever developed. It is characterized by extensive metabolism in the liver and possesses a number of metabolic products, giving it a lengthy half-life and a consequent long-acting anxiolytic effect. Its use in the management of anxiety and insomnia has been largely supplanted by benzodiazepines with less complicated metabolism and more predictable half-lives, but it remains in common use to protect against the effects of alcohol withdrawal. It is available in oral and injectable form. Because of erratic absorption, intramuscular administration is not advised. U.S. trade name: Librium."

As a result of this recoding, one item in memory (e.g., a keyword or key idea) can stand for multiple other items (e.g., a short list of associated points). The capacity of short-term memory is believed to be constant for the number of individual units it can store (see seven plus or minus two), but the units themselves can range from simple chunks (e.g., individual letters or numbers) to complex chunks (e.g., words or phrases). The exact number of chunks remembered depends on the size of each chunk or the subunits contained within each chunk. 2. the associated principle that effective communication between humans depends on sorting information into units that do not exceed the mind’s capacity to chunk them (the chunking limit). This has implications for the content and layout of written documents, diagrams and visual aids, websites, and so on. For example, any list of more than nine bullet points should normally be subdivided into two or more shorter lists. [coined by George Armitage Miller in 1956]"

            "details": "n. a linguistic unit smaller than a sentence but larger than a phrase; in traditional grammar, a clause is defined as having both a subject and a finite verb (i.e., one that agrees with the subject in number and person). Clauses are usually divided into two principal types: main clauses, which make sense by themselves and can constitute a sentence in their own right, and subordinate clauses, which are dependent on a main clause in both these respects. In I smiled at Jane, who waved back, for example, the words before the comma constitute a main clause and those after the comma are a subordinate clause. In psycholinguistics, clauses are considered to be an important unit of sentence processing. Sentences that are complex from a syntactic point of view, in that they contain one or more subordinate clauses, are also considered psychologically more complex. See complex sentence; coordination. —clausal adj."

This may be referred to as overcompensation when the substitute behavior exceeds what might actually be necessary in terms of level of compensation for the deficiency. Compensation may be a conscious or unconscious process. In his classical psychoanalytic theory, Sigmund Freud described compensation as a defense mechanism that protects the individual against the conscious realization of such deficiencies. The idea of compensation is central to Alfred Adler’s theory of personality, which sees all human striving as a response to feelings of inferiority (see also inferiority complex). However, many psychologists emphasize the positive aspects of compensation in mitigating the effects of a weakness or deficiency (see compensatory mechanism). For example, it can be regarded as an important component of successful aging because it reduces the negative effects of cognitive and physical decline associated with the aging process. See selective optimization with compensation. 2. in neuroscience, the recruitment of brain areas to substitute for the loss, due to injury or disease, of neural activity in other areas. See also brain reserve. 3. in Piagetian theory, a mental process—a form of reversibility—in which one realizes that for any operation there exists another operation that compensates for the effects of the first; that is, a change in one dimension can compensate for changes in another.

Affirming, strengthening, or achieving a client’s competence is often a basic goal in psychotherapy. 2. one’s developed repertoire of skills, especially as it is applied to a task or set of tasks. A distinction is sometimes made between competence and performance, which is the extent to which competence is realized in one’s actual work on a problem or set of problems. 3. in linguistics and psycholinguistics, the nonconscious knowledge of the underlying rules of a language that enables individuals to speak and understand it. In this sense, competence is a rationalist concept that must be kept distinct from the actual linguistic performance of any particular speaker, which may be constrained by such nonlinguistic factors as memory, attention, or fatigue. Both terms were introduced by Noam Chomsky, who proposed the study of linguistic competence as the true task of linguistics; in doing so, he effectively declared linguistics to be a branch of cognitive psychology.

Beyond these succinct, in some cases everyday, senses of the term, there are intricate philosophical and research controversies over the concept of consciousness and multiple perspectives about its meaning. Broadly, these interpretations divide along two (although not always mutually exclusive) major lines: (a) those proposed by scholars on the basis of function or behavior (i.e., consciousness viewed “from the outside”—the observable organism); and (b) those proposed by scholars on the basis of experience or subjectivity (i.e., consciousness viewed “from the inside”—the mind). The former generally represents the reductionist or materialist perspective (see materialism), whereas the latter generally represents the immaterialist perspective (see immaterialism). For example, functional or behavioral interpretations tend to define consciousness in terms of physical, neurobiological, and cognitive processes, such as the ability to discriminate stimuli, to monitor internal states, to control behavior, and to respond to the environment. According particularly to this view, the contents of consciousness are assessed through their ability to be reported accurately and verifiably (see reportability), although recent brain imaging research suggests that brain indices of conscious contents may become available. Experiential or subjective interpretations, however, tend to define consciousness in terms of mental imagery; intuition; subjective experience as related to sensations, perceptions, emotions, moods, and dreams; self-awareness; awareness of awareness itself and of the unity between the self and others and the physical world; stream of consciousness; and other aspects of private experience. According to this view, the contents of consciousness can be assessed to some extent by their reportability but must also, given their phenomenological nature, rely on introspection.

Traditionally, this process was presumed to be involved in conversion disorder, but current diagnostic criteria for the disorder do not make such an implication. 2. actual change in an individual’s beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors that occurs as a result of social influence. Unlike compliance, which is outward and temporary, conversion occurs when the targeted individual is personally convinced by a persuasive message or internalizes and accepts as his or her own the beliefs expressed by other group members. Also called private acceptance. See also conformity. 3. the movement of all members of a group to a single, mutually shared position, as when individuals who initially offer diverse opinions on a subject eventually come to share the same position. See group polarization. 4. the process by which a person comes to embrace a new religious faith (or, sometimes, a more intense version of his or her existing belief). For example, a nonbeliever who becomes Catholic has experienced a conversion, as has a member of a minority religion who adopts the beliefs of a more mainstream faith. In Protestant traditions, conversion is often seen as a sudden transformation in which a person apparently undergoes a dramatic change in his or her personality, values, and lifestyle.

Studies of nonhuman animals often suggest cooperation, but whether animals understand that individuals must act together to reach a common solution or whether they act randomly and occasionally appear to cooperate by chance is still unclear. Often cooperation leads to outcomes, such as increased food, predator avoidance, or survival of kin, that make it adaptive (see adaptation), but the benefit to each individual is not always obvious.

Blood levels of cortisol in humans vary according to sleep–wake cycles (generally being highest around 9:00 a.m. and lowest around midnight) and other factors; for example, they increase with lack of sleep and during pregnancy but decrease with diseases of the liver and kidneys. Cortisol is considered the primary stress hormone: In response to stress or injury, blood cortisol levels, and therefore glucose levels, increase, as does blood pressure, whereas activity of the immune system decreases and release of inflammatory substances in the body is contained. Cortisol thus improves the body’s ability to manage stress and to repair itself, and, since 1963, it and its synthetic analogs have been administered in the treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Exposure to prolonged stress, however, can lead to excessive levels of cortisol, which can have deleterious effects on the body (e.g., hyperglycemia). Cortisol has also been implicated in intrauterine growth retardation of the fetuses of pregnant women exposed to profound environmental stress (e.g., trauma, industrial or natural disasters).

In classical psychoanalysis, countertransference was viewed as a hindrance to the analyst’s understanding of the patient, but to modern analysts and therapists, it may serve as a source of insight into the patient’s effect on other people. In either case, the analyst or therapist must be aware of, and analyze, countertransference so that it can be used productively within the therapeutic process. See also control analysis."

Human courtship enables couples to develop mutual commitment, which has marriage as its goal, although it may take widely different forms in different cultures. For example, in some societies bodily contact between courting couples may be forbidden, whereas in others it may be accepted and even encouraged; or a man may be required in certain societies to obtain parents’ permission before asking a woman to marry him yet in others such a practice may be considered unnecessary or even impolite.

In nonhuman animals, crowding can lead to impaired reproduction, decreased life expectancy, and a variety of pathological behaviors. Two key mechanisms underlying crowding are lack of control over social interaction (i.e., privacy) and the deterioration of socially supportive relationships. See also behavioral sink; density. 2. a phenomenon in which the perception of a suprathreshold target is impaired by nearby distractors, reflecting a fundamental limitation on visual spatial resolution. In reading, for example, letter recognition is reduced by crowding from adjacent letters. Also called crowding effect."

Researchers have identified at least three ways in which individuals’ daydreaming styles differ: positive-constructive daydreaming, guilty and fearful daydreaming, and poor attentional control. These styles are posited to reflect the daydreamer’s overall emotion and personality tendencies. Among the important positive functions that daydreams may serve are the release of strong affect, the gaining of self-insight when reviewing past experiences or rehearsing for future situations, the generation of creative solutions, and the production of greater empathy for others."

            "details": "n. a philosophical and literary movement that emerged in Europe in the period between the two World Wars and became the dominant trend in Continental thought during the 1940s and 1950s. Existentialism is notoriously difficult to sum up in a single definition—partly because many who might be identified with the movement reject the label, and partly because the movement is itself often a rejection of systematization and classification. The origins of existentialism have been traced to a range of thinkers, including French philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal (1623–1662), Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855), German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, and Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821–1881). However, the first fully developed philosophy of existentialism is usually taken to be the existential phenomenology elaborated by German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889–1976) in the 1910s and 1920s. Heidegger’s concept of Dasein was a key influence on the work of the French philosopher and author Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980), who is usually seen as the existentialist thinker par excellence. In the immediate postwar years, Sartre popularized both the term existentialism and most of the ideas now associated with it. Existentialism represents a turning away from systematic philosophy, with its emphasis on metaphysical absolutes and principles of rational certainty, and toward an emphasis on the concrete existence of a human being “thrown” into a world that is merely “given” and contingent. Such a being encounters the world as a subjective consciousness, “condemned” to create its own meanings and values in an “absurd” and purposeless universe. The human being must perform this task without benefit of a fixed essence or inherent nature, and in the absence of any possibility of rational certainty. However, by accepting the burden of this responsibility, and refusing the “bad faith” of religion and other spurious rationalizations, he or she can achieve authenticity. Various forms of existential psychology have taken up the task of providing explanations, understandings of human behavior, and therapies based on existentialist assumptions about human existence. They have emphasized such constructs as alienation, authenticity, and freedom, as well as the difficulties associated with finding meaning and overcoming anxiety. —existential adj. —existentialist n., adj."

These include rapid heartbeat, redirection of blood flow away from the periphery toward the gut, tensing of the muscles, and a general mobilization of the organism to take action (see fear response; fight-or-flight response). Fear differs from anxiety in that the former is considered an appropriate short-term response to a present, clearly identifiable threat, whereas the latter is a future-oriented, long-term response focused on a diffuse threat. Some theorists characterize this distinction more particularly, proposing that fear is experienced when avoiding or escaping an aversive stimuli and that anxiety is experienced when entering a potentially dangerous situation (e.g., an animal foraging in a field where there might be a predator). Whatever their precise differences in meaning, however, the terms are often used interchangeably in common parlance. See also fright."

To social psychologists, the term commonly refers to the real or imagined presence of other persons, but it can also refer to the physical environment or to more abstract qualities (e.g., deadlines imposed by a supervisor or different motivational orientations). A central belief among social psychologists is that situations affect behavior, often powerfully so and often without the person’s awareness of such influence. Attention to the situation as a cause of behavior is commonly linked to Kurt Lewin’s famous dictum B = f(P, E), postulating that all behavior is a function of the person and the environment, although the strict separability of these two factors into independent causal forces is questionable."

Causation, for example, is only an inference that relates two observed events, and one has no knowledge that this relationship will apply in similar cases; it is a generalization that could be proved wrong by a different result. In modern philosophy, postmodernism, poststructuralism, and deconstruction are essentially systems of skepticism. —skeptic n. —skeptical adj."

The skin is well supplied with nerves and blood vessels and forms an effective yet sensitive barrier that prevents the entry of foreign substances and pathogens into the body. It defends against injury to underlying tissues, reduces water loss from the body, and forms part of the body’s temperature-regulation mechanism through the evaporation of sweat secreted from sweat glands. Human skin typically has only a sparse covering of hair, except on the head and genital regions, and the hair has minimal value as insulation, although it is often highly significant in social terms. In humans, insulation is provided mainly by the subcutaneous adipose tissue. The root of each hair arises from a hair follicle, into which the ducts of sebaceous glands discharge sebum, an oily secretion that lubricates and waterproofs the skin surface. Various types of sensory nerve endings provide the skin with touch and pressure sensitivity, as well as sensations of pain and temperature (see cutaneous receptor)."

See Cartesian self; egocentric predicament. —solipsist n. —solipsistic adj."

The English word corresponds to the Greek psyche, often also translated as “mind,” and the Latin anima, usually translated as “spirit.” The concept of the soul was present in early Greek thinking and has been an important feature of many philosophical systems and most religions. Some traditional areas of debate have included whether the soul is material or immaterial, whether nonhuman animals, plants, or seemingly inert natural objects have souls (see panpsychism), and whether the soul is individual, allowing the personality to persist after death, or whether it is a reflection of a universal “cosmic” soul. Because the existence of the soul has resisted empirical verification, science has generally ignored the concept, and those who adhere to materialism, positivism, or reductionism reject it absolutely. Despite this, the term survives in the general language to mean the deepest center of a person’s identity and the seat of his or her most important moral, emotional, and aesthetic experiences."

The latter, attached to Sertoli cells, mature into spermatozoa.

However, the relationship of the reuptake mechanism to the therapeutic qualities of these agents has not been clearly elucidated. SSRIs also block the activity of certain subtypes of serotonin autoreceptors, and this may also be associated with their therapeutic effects. SSRIs have fewer adverse effects than the tricyclic antidepressants and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, but common side effects include nausea, headache, anxiety, and tremor, and some patients may experience sexual dysfunction.

A therapeutic window is thought to exist for nortriptyline: Although plasma levels do not always correlate with clinical effectiveness, optimum responses are thought to occur when serum levels of the drug are between 50 and 150 ng/ml. Plasma levels over 500 ng/ml are toxic. The availability of newer antidepressants that do not require therapeutic monitoring has led to a decline in its use. U.S. trade names: Aventyl; Pamelor."

Nurses practice in a variety of contexts, including hospitals, nursing and independent-living homes, schools, workplaces, and community centers, among others. In the United States, nurses must graduate from a state-approved school of nursing (a 4-year university program, a 2-year associate degree program, or a 3-year diploma program) and pass a state licensing examination. See also licensed practical nurse; registered nurse. 2. the provision of nourishment by a female for her young offspring until they are capable of obtaining their own food. Nursing in mammals (including humans, in whom it is called breast-feeding) primarily involves the secretion of milk from the mammary glands, as stimulated by the hormones prolactin and oxytocin. Other vertebrates exhibit different forms of nursing behavior. For example, some birds produce a milklike substance (crop milk) within their digestive system that is regurgitated to feed young chicks. The length of the nursing period varies across animals, ranging from mere days (e.g., Sprague–Dawley rats) to several years (e.g., bottlenose dolphins). Regardless of its form or duration, however, successful nursing is critical to survival and often depends on maternally emitted odorants (mammary pheromones) to enable the young to locate the nipple and initiate suckling."

Molecules of odorants are absorbed into nasal mucus and carried to the olfactory epithelium, where they stimulate the receptor sites of the cilia. The olfactory receptors carry impulses in axonal bundles through tiny holes in the cribriform plate, the bony layer separating the base of the skull from the nasal cavity.

From some philosophical perspectives, ontology is synonymous with metaphysics, in that both ask fundamental questions about what reality is. However, from the perspective of contemporary existentialism and hermeneutics, ontology implies a concern with the meaning of existence that is largely lacking in traditional metaphysics. Whereas metaphysics asks “What is there?” or “What is fundamental?,” the question of ontology is often posed as “What does it mean to ‘be’ at all?” For example, to say that Smith is a professor is to rely on a very different sense of the verb be than is present in a statement that Smith is hungry. Likewise, Smith is not a professor in the same way that a painting is beautiful. Contemporary approaches to ontology often take their analytical point of departure from the work of German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889–1976). In this tradition, psychology is the pursuit of an adequate understanding of the ontology of human beings. It asks, or ought to ask, “What does it mean to be a human being?” See being-in-the-world; Dasein; existential phenomenology. —ontological adj."

Schizophrenia was first formally described in the late 19th century by Emil Kraepelin, who named it dementia praecox; in 1908, Eugen Bleuler renamed the disorder schizophrenia (Greek, “splitting of the mind”) to characterize the disintegration of mental functions associated with what he regarded as its fundamental symptoms of abnormal thinking and affect. According to DSM–IV–TR, the characteristic disturbances must last for at least 6 months and include at least 1 month of active-phase symptoms comprising two or more of the following: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, or negative symptoms (e.g., lack of emotional responsiveness, extreme apathy). These signs and symptoms are associated with marked social or occupational dysfunction. Some have argued (beginning with Bleuler) that disorganized thinking (see formal thought disorder; schizophrenic thinking) is the single most important feature of schizophrenia, but DSM–IV–TR and its predecessors have not emphasized this feature, at least in their formal criteria. DSM–5 retains essentially the same criteria but emphasizes that delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech must be among the symptoms required for diagnosis. It also eliminates the five distinct subtypes of schizophrenia previously described in DSM–IV–TR: catatonic schizophrenia, disorganized schizophrenia, paranoid schizophrenia, residual schizophrenia, and undifferentiated schizophrenia. —schizophrenic adj."

Its medical use was discontinued because of adverse reactions, including agitation, delirium, disorientation, and hallucinations. High doses may induce stupor or coma. PCP has a complex mechanism of action. It binds as an antagonist to the NMDA receptor; it also acts as a dopamine-receptor agonist and blocks the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, among other actions. Because intoxication with PCP can produce symptoms resembling both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, some consider it to be a useful drug model of that disorder. PCP became common as an illicit drug in the 1970s. It can be smoked (often in combination with marijuana or tobacco), insufflated (inhaled nasally), or taken orally or intravenously (see angel dust). Despite speculation about its potential to damage nerve tissue, PCP remains a popular illicit drug. It is still used in veterinary medicine, primarily as an immobilizing anesthetic during surgical procedures. See also hallucinogen. 2. abbreviation for primary care provider."

Personalism reorients the material of psychology around an experiencing individual as a systematic focal point. Thus, the findings of psychology can be organized only by reference to such a unique, living individual as the originator, carrier, and regulator of all psychological states and processes. This position reflects that of the school of personalistic psychology. 2. a tendency to believe that another person’s actions are directed at oneself rather than being an expression of that individual’s characteristics."

Mental events should be studied and described in their own terms, rather than in terms of their relationship to events in the body or in the external world. However, phenomenology should be distinguished from introspection as it is concerned with the relationship between acts of consciousness and the objects of such acts (see intentionality). Husserl’s approach proved widely influential in psychology (especially Gestalt psychology) and the social sciences; it also inspired the work of German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889–1976), whose existential phenomenology provided the basis for existentialism and existential psychology. —phenomenological adj. —phenomenologist n."

Divided into three subgroups—aliphatic, piperazine, and piperidine—the drugs in this class of conventional antipsychotics were the first effective antipsychotic medications and at one time were the most widely used agents for the treatment of schizophrenia. They are also used for the treatment of acute mania, psychotic agitation, and nausea and vomiting, as well as for preanesthesia sedation. It is commonly assumed that their therapeutic effects are produced by blockade of dopamine D2 receptors (see dopamine-receptor antagonist); they also block acetylcholine, histamine, and norepinephrine receptors. A variety of adverse side effects is associated with their use, including extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, sedation, and anticholinergic effects."

In DSM–IV–TR, it is classified with the feeding and eating disorders of infancy or early childhood; in DSM–5, it falls within a broader category of feeding and eating disorders that can affect individuals at any age. Onset of the disorder does, however, most commonly occur in children, and it can have serious consequences, depending on the substance ingested. For example, lead pica, often found in children living in older housing with lead paint, can result in irreversible mental impairment. Studies on rats and monkeys have also demonstrated that lead pica can be induced by calcium deficiency. Animals with normal nutrition learn that lead ingestion is aversive, but calcium-deficient animals do not learn aversions to lead."

Piloerection is involuntary, being directed by the sympathetic nervous system, and elicited by cold, fear, or a startling stimulus. In mammals with a thick, visible covering of hair (e.g., cats), piloerection serves a protective function: The resulting “fluffed up” appearance makes the animal seem larger and may deter attack by others. In humans, whose skin has only a sparse covering of hair, piloerection creates a temporary roughness as the muscles pucker the surrounding skin, giving rise to such colloquial names for the effect as goose bumps, goose flesh, and goose pimples. Also called pilomotor response (or effect)."

Play is a cultural universal and typically regarded as an important mechanism in children’s cognitive, social, and emotional development. Research on the topic abounds: Various types of play have been described—with locomotor play, object play, and social play generally considered to be the three basic forms—and numerous theories about the specific functions of play have been proposed. Advocates of the practice theory of play, for example, propose that play prepares children for activities or roles they will encounter as adults, whereas others suggest that it serves a more immediate function, such as exercise, establishing social relations among peers, or—according to the surplus energy theory—using up excess energy. Other theories include those of Sigmund Freud, who claimed that play is a means for children to deal with anxiety-producing events; Jean Piaget, who believed that play promotes cognitive competence by helping children incorporate new information into existing cognitive structures; Erik Erikson, who viewed play sequences as models by which children relive aspects of the past, represent aspects of the present, and anticipate aspects of the future; and Lev Vygotsky, who conceived of play as facilitating symbolic processes by providing children with opportunities to establish meaning. Although the preponderance of research on play focuses on the activities of children, the play behavior of nonhuman animals is also actively studied. Often including components of courtship, aggression, predation, and sexual behavior in contexts where these do not seem appropriate, animal play appears to serve several important developmental functions. These include fostering the acquisition of social skills and the formation of social relationships, enhancing confidence (e.g., by teaching a young animal the flexibility to respond to unexpected events such as being knocked off balance), and strengthening sensorimotor systems."

Its effect is to establish science as the model for all forms of valid inquiry and to dismiss the truth claims of religion, metaphysics, and speculative philosophy. Positivism, particularly logical positivism, was extremely influential in the early development of psychology and helped to form its commitment to empirical methods.

Most postmodern positions reject traditional metaphysics for its pursuit of a reality independent of the world of lived experience, traditional epistemology for its pursuit of certain knowledge and objectivity, and traditional ethical theories because of their reliance on metaphysics and epistemology. More specifically, they see the ideal of objective truth that has been a guiding principle in the sciences and most other disciplines since the 17th century as basically flawed: There can be no such truth, only a plurality of “narratives” and “perspectives.” Postmodernism emphasizes the construction of knowledge and truth through discourse and lived experience, the similar construction of the self, and relativism in all questions of value. It is therefore a form of radical skepticism. See also poststructuralism. 2. in the arts, a general movement away from the tenets and practices of modernism that became apparent in the late 20th century.

It is represented by the work of Jacques Derrida (1930–2004) in philosophy and criticism, Jacques Lacan (1901–1981) in philosophy and psychoanalysis, Michel Foucault (1926–1984) in the history of ideas, and Hélène Cixous (1937– ) and Julia Kristeva (1941– ) in feminist theory, among others. Although these thinkers are diverse, they share a starting point in the structuralist account of language given by Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913), which holds that linguistic signs acquire meaning only through structural relationships with other signs in the same language system. Poststructuralism endorses the arbitrariness of the sign, but from this basis it proceeds to question the whole idea of fixed and determinate meaning. In the deconstruction of Derrida, structures and systems of meaning are found to be unstable, contradictory, and endlessly self-subverting. This skepticism extends to the idea of personal identity itself; according to Derrida, the self is merely another “text” to be deconstructed. In psychology, poststructuralism is mainly significant because of its influence on the radical psychoanalytical theories of the 1960s and 1970s. Lacan, who trained and practiced as a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, rejected the idea of a stable autonomous ego and reinterpreted the Freudian unconscious in terms of Saussure’s structural linguistics. His unconventional ideas and methods led to his exclusion from the International Society of Psychoanalysts in 1963. Both Kristeva (another practicing psychoanalyst) and Cixous were deeply influenced by Lacan’s ideas of sexuality, consciousness, and language, which are given a radical feminist twist in their writings. The best known work of Foucault, who worked in a psychiatric hospital as a young man, is his Folie et déraison: Histoire de la folie à l’âge classique (1961; translated as Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason, 1965), which gives a tendentious history of Western attitudes to insanity, arguing that the categories of madness and reason are themselves oppressive. —poststructuralist adj."

For example, if a given statistical test has a power of .70, then there is a 70% probability that its use will result in the null hypothesis correctly being rejected as false, with a corresponding 30% chance that its use will lead to a Type II error. Power ranges from 0 to 1, with values of .80 or above generally considered acceptable. 3. a mathematical notation that indicates the number of times a quantity is multiplied by itself."

The behavior has been studied periodically at least since William James (see psychology of religion), with varied results. For instance, researchers and practitioners have noted, on the one hand, that prayer can be used as a defense or escape from the exploration of painful issues and as a form of magical thinking and, on the other hand, that it can be both cognitively meaningful and therapeutically beneficial in some conditions for those with specific religious beliefs or spirituality. Much work has been done, since the late 1970s, by a growing body of researchers to integrate religious values and practices with psychotherapy. In appropriate circumstances, prayer may be explicitly used by some therapists as a component of intervention and treatment. The therapist and client may pray individually or together for such goals as personal or interpersonal healing, forgiveness, and the ability to examine problems freely and with discernment."

Calvin’s system is sometimes described as one of double predestination, as it maintains that God also foreordained a portion of humankind to damnation, an idea that raises particular moral difficulties. Predestination is a form of theological determinism, as it effectively denies human free will and moral responsibility. The concept has always been the subject of intense debate and is now rejected by most mainstream Christian thinkers. See Calvinism."

            "details": "n. the biological predisposition to quickly learn associations between stimuli, responses, and reinforcers that can be explained by their fit with genetic traits that evolved to enhance the chances of a species’ survival. For example, it has been suggested that humans readily learn certain phobias (e.g., fear of snakes) because of a predisposition to fear anything that could pose a threat to their survival. Preparedness (or prepared learning) also has been proposed as an explanation for why both human and nonhuman animals readily learn to associate certain foods with gastric illness and are more likely to avoid such foods in the future. In experiments to establish conditioned taste aversion, for instance, rats readily learn to associate a distinctive taste with illness; it has been proposed that they have an inherent preparedness to make this association, whereas they do not easily learn to make an association between a tone or light stimulus and illness because such contraprepared learning is incompatible with their evolutionary history. Along the continuum of preparedness—with highly prepared, easily formed associations on one end and contraprepared, poorly formed associations on the other—unprepared associations are intermediate occurrences; these are associations formed through unprepared learning that occurs despite the lack of a biological predisposition to form them.
