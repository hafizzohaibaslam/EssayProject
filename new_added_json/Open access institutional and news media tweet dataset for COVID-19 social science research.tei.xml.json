               "As COVID-19 quickly became one of the most concerned global crisis, the demand for data in academic research is also increasing. Currently, there are several open access Twitter datasets, but none of them is dedicated to the institutional and news media Twitter data collection. To fill this blank, we retrieved data from 69 institutional/news media Twitter accounts, 17 of them were related to government and international organizations, 52 of them were news media across North America, Europe and Asia. We believe our open access data can provide researchers more availability to conduct social science research."

               "COVID-19 was announced as pandemic by WHO on 11 Mar , being the only pandemic in the past 10 years (the last one was 2009 swing flu), it was first detected as an unknown pneumonia in Wuhan (Hubei, China). On April 1st, 2020, John Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center , reported that the ongoing epidemic has infected people, the death toll has already reached 47,272, given the highly contagious nature of the virus as well as the significant mortality rate, numerous governments have announced national lockdown. The impact of COVID-19 on world economy and politics is unprecedented in modern time.",
               "On the past Ebola epidemic crisis, scholars found the importance of using Twitter data to do social science research , , many of them use this microblog data as social indicators to analyze the effect of epidemic outbreak on public concerns , health information needs and health seeking behavior , and public response to policy makers etc. Current open access COVID-19 Twitter data were mainly collected by keywords, such as coronavirus, Covid-19 etc , , none of the them is dedicated to government/news media tweet collection. Given that our retrieval targets are policy makers and news source, we believe our dataset can provide scholars more valuable data to conduct social science research in related fields, such as crisis communication, public relation etc."

We update our dataset every week (last update on April 2, 2020), after removing duplicated data by matching tweet id, we get the clean version data.",
