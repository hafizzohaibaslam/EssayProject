               "With the prevalence of social media and online forum, opinion mining, aiming at analyzing and discovering the latent opinion in user-generated reviews on the Internet, has become a hot research topic. This survey focuses on two important subtasks in this field, stance detection and product aspect mining, both of which can be formalized as the problem of the triple target, aspect, opinion extraction. In this paper, we first introduce the general framework of opinion mining and describe the evaluation metrics. Then, the methodologies for stance detection on different sources, such as online forum and social media are discussed. After that, approaches for product aspect mining are categorized into three main groups which are corpus level aspect extraction, corpus level aspect, and opinion mining, and document level aspect and opinion mining based on the processing units and tasks. And then we discuss the challenges and possible solutions. Finally, we summarize the evolving trend of the reviewed methodologies and conclude the survey.

               "With the pervasiveness of online discussion forum and social media platform, user generated text containing opinions on some hot issues has increased significantly. Due to the large amount of such emotional reviews and posts on Internet, it is impossible for users to digest such information manually. Therefore, automatically mining opinion from online texts, aiming at discovering user concerned topics and the corresponding opinion, becomes essential. In general, opinion mining aims to extract a quintuple < e, a, s, h, t > from texts, where e is the entity or the target, a is the aspect of the entity e, h is the opinion holder, t is the time when the opinion holder expresses her opinion on the entity e, and s is the opinion which h holds to the aspect a of the entity e at t. For example, opinion mining processes the review text ''I bought a new iPhoneX today, the screen is great, but the voice quality is poor'' and outputs two quintuples < iPhoneX, screen, great, I, today> and < iPhoneX, voice quality, poor, I, today>. However, not all the opinion mining tasks need to extract all the five elements in quintuple.",
               "The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and approving it for publication was Alexandros Iosifidis.",
               "For example, sentiment analysis cares more about the sentiment polarity s of the text, stance detection aims to identify the opinion s to the specific target e, and product aspect mining focus on extracting the aspect a and corresponding opinion s from text.",
               "In the last decade, stance detection and product aspect mining have attracted many scholars. Following the general opinion mining framework, stance detection can be formalized as the task of extracting tuple < e, s > (e means target and s represents opinion) without considering other elements. Stance detection focuses on detecting the user stance (favor, against) on a particular debate topic or hot-debated event. It is similar to sentiment analysis , , but with big difference. In specific, sentiment analysis aims to identify the sentiment polarity (positive, negative) of the text while stance detection cares about the stance on the target. For example, the tweet ''Jeb bush is the only sane candidate in this republican lineup, I support him'' will be assigned positive by sentiment analysis , , but extracted with 'against' stance to the topic ''Donald Trump as President'' by stance detection. Research on stance detection can be categorized into four groups based on debate settings, such as congressional floor debates - , company-internal discussions , , online forums ideological debates - and hot-event oriented debates on social media - . The latter two are open domain and flexible, therefore more challengeable. For example, the debate forum such as convinceMe.net has a wide range of debate topics from the playful (e.g. to the ideological (e.g. . Furthermore, the participants prefer to use colorful and emotional language to express their viewpoints, such as the tweet ''It looks like they like Hilary more. . . and that plain stupid'' related to the hashtag ''#2016US election# ''. Therefore, we concentrate on the prevalent work of stance detection for online debate forums and social media in this survey.",
               "Different from stance detection, product aspect mining aims at detecting relevant aspects and opinions. Following the general opinion mining framework, product aspect mining can be formalized as the task of extracting triple < e, a, s > (e means target, a and s represent aspect and opinion respectively). Based on text granularity, it could be categorized into corpus level and document/sentence level mining. The corpus level mining could be further divided into two categories: aspect extraction, aspect and opinion mining. Corpus level aspect extraction aims to mine the aspect terms or aspect phrases in the corpus while ignoring where the aspects are discussed. Similarly, corpus level aspect and opinion mining extract both the aspects and the corresponding opinions without considering where they are expressed. Actually, corpus level mining pays attention to the aspects that most reviews are interested in and the corresponding opinions while document/sentence level mining focus on extracting aspect and opinion terms in a single review. After the first attempt of corpus level extraction, numerous approaches have been proposed which could be categorized as rule-based and unsupervised learning based models. Early aspect mining systems employ frequency pattern mining technique - to extract aspect terms in the reviews. To overcome the disadvantages of missing low frequency aspects and ignoring semantic similarity of aspects, unsupervised learning based approaches - are proposed by casting the task into a clustering problem. Different from corpus level mining, document/sentence level aspect and opinion mining concentrates on detecting the aspects and opinions in each individual document or sentence. It can be viewed as a sequential tagging problem. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) , Condition Random Fields (CRFs) - and deep neural networks, such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - , Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) - and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) - based approaches have been proposed to tackle the problem.",
               "Both stance detection and product aspect mining might benefit various downstream applications, such as public mood prediction regarding political movement, market intelligence and movie sales prediction . Also, they could benefit latent customers by providing smart purchase decision, manufactures by providing the measurement of customer satisfaction to adjust their manufacturing process and sales strategy, and governmental organizations by informing public opinions of a political election .",
               "Several surveys on opinion mining have been published. Pang gives a good survey and introduction to the field of sentiment analysis. However, the coverage of the survey published in is restricted mostly to document-level machine learning approaches. Likewise, Tang presents a shorter survey mainly focusing on document-level machine learning approach as well. Besides, Liu gives a survey, with an updated overview of the entire field of sentiment analysis.",
               "In this paper, we focus on the methodologies for two subtasks of opinion mining which are online stance detection and product aspect mining. Thus, we provide a brief survey and categorization on the previous methodologies. Earlier work mainly relies on frequency, relation rules and feature engineering. Later, computational linguistic model and machine learning techniques are explored for the two tasks. With the popularity of deep learning in last five years, researchers have paid attention to employ representation learning and neuralbased models , - . The remains of the paper will be organized as follows. Section 2 represents the evaluation metrics and the available datasets. Section 3 describes the methods applied in stance detection. A survey on product aspect mining will be presented in Section 4. Challenges and possible solutions are described in Section 5. In Section 6, we will conclude the survey.

               "To delve into the mechanism of these approaches, is selected to illustrate the process of detecting the stance by using textual content only. To capture the stance related information from the post content, Anand and Walker design a feature set containing n-grams, repeated punctuations, cue words, LIWC and three variant syntactic dependency based features. The n-grams feature isc constituted by uni-grams, bi-grams and the basic counts of the post, such as post length. The statistical measures like word per sentence (WPS), pronominal forms (Pro), positive emotion words (PosE) and negative emotion words (NegE) are employed as LIWC feature. And the repeated punctuations are also considered as punctuation feature in because Anand assumes that the repeated punctuations have a special meaning. Besides, three dependency features (Dependency feature, Generalized dependency feature and opinion dependency feature) are employed to capture the syntactic relations between terms in the posts. In detail, the Stanford parser generates a set of grammatical relations represented as (rel i , w j , w k ) to capture the relations between words. The generalized dependency features are constructed by replacing the head term with its part-of-speech tag in the output of Stanford parser. Similarly, opinion dependency features are created by replacing the sentiment word with the corresponding polarity label (e.g. '+' or '?'). To make full use of rebuttal links and improve the detection performance, the rebuttal posts is combined with its parent post in . And the proposed approach achieves a competitive accuracy (54%-69%).",
               "Although, the work in can achieve better performance compared with uni-grams baseline. However, it could not capture any semantic information from post content. Thus, Hasan adds both linguistic extension based on the semantic frame patterns and extra-linguistic extension into the approach. Similarly, Elfardy uses the latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) and the weighted textual matrix factorization(WTMF) to extract the topic distribution of the posts as the semantic representation, and the two distributions are combined using word sense disambiguation (WSD) strategy to achieve a better performance. Somasundaran and Wiebe construct an arguing lexicon and obtain an argument feature which helps with task. Likewise, Kyaw combines tf-idf weights with POS-tags to build the text representation for stance detection. Ghosh and Anand propose a two stage method which firstly detect the argumentative posts from review corpus and then detect the stance for argumentative ones."

In , Walker proposes a graph (V , E)-based approach, each node v in the graph represents a post and edge e indicates the relation, either agreement or disagreement, constructed by the relationship between the posts/authors. Two assumptions are made that all posts written by the same author share the same stance to a specific debate and the rebuttal links in the forum indicate the disagreement relation between corresponding posts. And the proposed approach obtains F score 82%. However, it could not work well in some debate topics (such as Mac vs. PC) and get F score :18% which may because that MaxCut algorithm actually divides the posts into clusters, but then assigns them to the wrong stance.",
               "Sridhar and Getoor propose a probabilistic soft logic (PSL) based model to model the structural and linguistic feature of the posts collectively. By using the PSL rules and the specific corpus (agreement and disagreement relations between context posts has been manual annotated in the collection), the proposed approach infers the probabilistic relationship between posts and the stance labels with good performance, and other relational information could be incorporate into the framework easily. Following this way, to avoid annotating the degree of disagreement beforehand, an improved hinge-loss Markov Random Field is proposed by using a disagreement classifier for determining the agreement polarity between posts. Besides, motivated by the observation that if a post in a post sequence is a reply to its parent, its stance should be depend on that of its parent, Hasan views the task as a sequential labeling problem and devises a HMM-based approach which gets an accuracy 57.5%.",
               "However, the previously discussed collective models do not perform well when facing the particular debate with a low participating rate. Inspired by the collaborative filtering, Qiu and Sim integrate the auxiliary information (textual content, user interactions and user attributes provided in biographical information) into the regression-based latent factor model and employ the binomial matrix factorization for stance modeling, the experiment results prove that interaction and user preference provide rich information for estimating the stance of cold-start user. To further consider the relationship between different debate topics, Li and Porco view stance detection as a representation learning task. Thus, they embed the text content and user interactions into a same space and obtain a more informative representation. Trabelsi and Za?ane devise an unsupervised model based on the assumption that users with different viewpoint are prone to communicate frequently, and the proposed method improves the performance in both user level and post level stance detection."

The system, designed by Wei , employs the Google News corpus to train the word2vec and the learned word embeddings are taken as the input. Besides, the 'vote scheme' (e.g. for each tweet in test set, ten candidate labels are employed to vote the final stance of the tweet) and the 'divide and conquer scheme' (e.g. training set and test set are separated by specific topic and the models are trained respectively) are incorporated to improve the performance. Tohoku uses the word embeddings trained by Continuous Bag-Of-Words (CBOW) model on Wikipedia article corpus. A comparison is also conducted with hybrid featurebased logistic regression model (e.g. Reply, Bag-Of-Words, Bag-Of-Dependency and SentiWordNet features). Experimental results show that CNN based approach performs better in validation set while hybrid feature based classifier achieves better performance in test set. To explore the impact of embedding granularity, Prashanth proposes the wordlevel CNN and the character-level CNN based model with a novel data augmentation technique which could expand and diversify the training dataset.

However, the proposed model performs the worst in the all supervised models, this because the predicted author embedding may incorporate the noise information into the model and impact the performance. Sun and Wang employ a hierarchical attention mechanism into LSTM framework to capture the various linguistic information which are helpful for detecting stance.

Compared with the Du and Xu's work, obtains a relatively bad results which may because that Wei's model do not consider the target information when predicting the stance of the tweet.",
               "Besides, there also exists some work focus on feature engineering and traditional classifier. Approaches in , - , , use SVM as classifier and explore various feature, such as text feature and dependency based features. Patra uses the sentiment feature (e.g. built by SentiWordNet, NRC Emotion Lexicon and Hashtag Emotion Lexicon ) and the dependency relation which is created by Stanford parser (e.g. search the word pairs in dependency relations that consist of two component words, one is 'favor' or 'against', and the other should appear in SentiWordNet). Elfardy employs the latent semantic feature which is obtained by latent dirichlet allocation or weighted textual matrix factorization to capture the semantic information in tweets. Misra employs the LIWC feature and proposed a feature based approach. Gadek and Betsholtz mine the contextonyms and contextosets from the co-occurrence graph to build context-based feature and obtain F score : 65.0%. Boltuzic designs a hybrid feature set containing word features, word embeddings, document statistical feature and hashtag features. Besides, he proposes an ensemble approach based on the genetic algorithm. Wojatzki views the task as a multi-dimensional classification problem and employs a stacked classifier which firstly identifies the tweets that contain the stance from neutral tweets and then detects the specific stance. Likewise, Dey devises a two stage approach by using various features (e.g. MPQA subjectivity lexicon, WordNet Adjective) and obtains the best overall performance (F avg : 74.44%).

The sparsity and the flexibility of the social media text, such as examples in , make it difficult to extract high-efficiency document representation for classification. ii). The datasets of social media stance detection have limited labeled document. Within the labeled datasets, the corpus related to 'Hillary Clinton' is the largest one which contains only 984 training instance and the limitation of the training corpus may also deteriorate the performance, especially for the deep learning based approaches."

               "Weakly supervised stance detection aims to assign a stance to each tweet by using both labeled (source domain, e.g. 'Atheism', 'Hillary Clinton' and etc) and unlabeled collection (target domain, 'Donald Trump' provided in ). The last six rows in describe the approaches for weakly supervised stance detection.",
               "To illustrate how the weakly supervised stance detection system works, we choose the as example. The flowchart is shown in . The approach proposed in firstly identifies the stance features (e.g. the n-grams which could indicate a stance or sentiment polarity) in the unlabeled corpus by inspecting the high frequent n-grams and employs the well-defined filtering rules to remove the irrelevant tweets. Then, three off-the-shelf sentiment analysis APIs (HP Haven On Demand , IBM Alchemy and Vivekn ) are employed to automatically assign a stance for each tweet according to the summation of three candidate scores. Finally, the proposed approach labels the tweet as favor if the value is positive and vice versa. Specifically, the tweet will be labeled as neutral when the scores achieved from Haven and Alchemy are equal to zero. And a SVM classifier which is trained on the constructed noisy labeled training set is used to predict the stance for tweets in corpus about 'Donald Trump'.",
               "Similarly, Wan employs a two-step strategy to build the weakly labeled corpus automatically and predicts the stance of tweet in the unlabeled dataset. The corpus is built based on the assumption that some expressions and hashtags may reveal the tendency of the stance to a specific topic. For example, 'go trump' and '#MakeAmericaGreatA-gain# ' reveal favor tendency, 'idiot' and '#BeatTrump# ' could induce against tendency to Trump. Wan employs the tendency expressions and hashtags (e.g. 'idiot', 'go trump' and etc) to retrieve the tweets in domain corpus provided in . Thus, Wan obtains a training set with noisy label which contains 2K favor tweets and 3K against tweets. Then, the constructed corpus is used to train a three class CNN-based detector. Likewise, another two-stage approach is proposed in . Firstly, a tweet is considered as neutral if no target related frequent nouns appear. Then, the topic specific classifiers are trained on five labeled datasets. For each opinionated tweet, a topic which is most similar to the tweet is chosen, and the corresponding classifier is selected to detect the stance.",
               "Besides, deep learning based approaches have also been employed for the task. Augenstein uses the stacked auto-encoder to learn the representation of the tweets. And the auto-encoder is trained on a collected corpus (contains 395K unlabeled tweets) which is related to all the six targets provided in (e.g. 'Hillary Clinton', 'Atheism', 'Donald Trump' and etc). Thus, the trained auto-encoder learns the mapping function and reduce the domain gap. Finally, Augenstein employs the representative vector (mapped by the learned encoder) of labeled tweets in to train the stance detector and obtains a comparable result.",
               "It could be observed from that weakly supervised models performs worse than the standard supervised approaches. This may because: i). weakly supervised stance detection requires the models to transfer the knowledge contained in source domain (e.g 'Atheism', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Climate Change', 'Feminist Movement' and 'Legal. Abortion') into the target domain 'Donald Trump'. Compared with the standard supervised detection task, it is more challenging. ii). the reviewed approaches in this field employ the learned knowledge from source domain to label the training data in target domain which may feed noise in label space and such noise will also impact the performance. iii). As discussed in last subsection, the dataset contains only hundreds of train data in each domain, the shortage of the train data make it hard to learn an effective neural network to transfer the knowledge into the target domain which may also result in the bad performance of the weakly supervised models.",
               "Although many deep learning based approaches , , , obtain better results than the traditional feature based models - , the traditional feature engineering based method performs the best. This may because: i). Dey employs so many elaborate features (such as sentiment lexicons, n-grams, POS tags) to capture the syntactic and semantic meaning of the tweets; ii) the small number of training data in this field limit the representation ability and the efficiency of the deep learning based model. Thus, we also believe that the deep learning based approaches will beat the traditional methods as long as the model has more labeled training data (such as thousands of tweets)."

The 1st ? 9th rows in list the rule-based approaches for corpus level aspect extraction.",
               "To delve into the mechanism of rule-based aspect extraction system, the method reported in  depicts the framework) is employed to illustrate the extraction process. As shown in , the proposed approach contains two stages: frequent aspect extraction and infrequent aspect extraction. When the product-specific review corpus (e.g. related to Digital camera, Cellular phone, Mp3 player or DVD player) has been crawled from e-commerce sites, the mining system firstly conducts POS tagging on the corpus. Then, aspect generation module which is based on the apriori algorithm is employed to extract the frequent noun terms and noun phrases as candidate set. Obviously, not all terms in candidate set are aspects. To improve the precision of the extraction system, two pruning strategies (compactness pruning and redundancy pruning) are designed to filter the uninterested and redundant ones in the candidate set. For example, 'life' is not an appropriate aspect while 'battery life' is a good aspect candidate in an electronic device related topic. After pruning the extracted aspect set, the system will turn to opinion word extraction phase, which also helps to extract the infrequent aspects. Based on the assumption that adjective which appears near the aspect term is prone to express an opinion, the adjectives nearby the aspect word are identified to construct the opinion word set. Finally, the infrequent aspects (discussed by a small group of customers but attractive to potential users, e.g. 'red eye' in a camera review) are extracted by identifying the noun terms or noun phrases nearby the opinion words in each sentence. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves the performance of Recall : 80% and Precision : 72%.",
               "Similarly, Liu and Hu propose an aspect extraction and visualization approach, named OpinionObserver. In , Liu proposes a novel extraction approach for review collections with special format (Each review contains Pros, Cons and the detailed review. Namely, consumers are asked to express Pros and Cons briefly together with a detailed review. For example, reviewer could write 'heavy, bad picture quality, battery life too short, and keyboard easy to use' to express Cons opinion). Liu employs a POS-tagger to preprocess the corpus and generate a set of language patterns for aspect words extraction. For example, the pattern '[aspect] easy to <v>' will match the aspect 'keyboard' from 'keyboard easy to use'. Based on the assumption that domain specific term prone to appear more frequent in domain corpus than the general corpus, Scaffidi proposes an aspect scoring method in to evaluate the aspect quality. The proposed approach firstly detects the frequent uni-gram nouns and noun phrases. Then, a 100 million-word corpus is employed as the general corpus to evaluate aspect candidateshigh score candidates are considered as aspects. Finally, this ranking approach improves the quality of extracted aspects (Precision : 85% ? 90%). Likewise, Zhang proposes a two-stage approach to rank the extracted aspects according to the aspect importance and the score is estimated Hyperlinkinduced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm. To incorporate the syntactic structure information into extraction system, Zhaoemploys a tree kernel based approach to capture the relations between aspect and opinion words which helps to obtain high quality aspects.",
               "The approaches discussed above follow the assumption that product aspects are nouns or noun phrases and could not extract the aspects such as 'operating system' which matches 'Verb+Noun' pattern. To deal with such problem, Li employs four POS patterns (e.g. 'Noun', 'Verb', 'Noun+Noun', 'Verb+Noun') to extract the aspect candidates and creates a noisy aspect set. Further, a syntax adjective rule (most customers use the syntax 'aspect+adjective' to express their opinion to product, e.g. ''The operating is simple, and the reaction is quick'') is employed to filter the noisy aspect. These four elaborate patterns and adjective rules help to improve the quality of the extracted aspects.",
               "Differs from the discussed explicit aspect extraction approaches, Zhenfocus on the implicit aspect extraction task. A novel approach based on co-occurrence association rule mining is proposed in . At the first stage, association rules (in the form of [opinion, explicit aspect]) are generated from the co-occurrence matrix. Afterwards, aspect clusters could be constructed by clustering the rules according to their semantic similarity. When given a review without any explicit aspects, the system could select the cluster with the highest frequency weight and choose one representative word as the implicit aspect of the review. Likewise, Konjengbam employs POS-tags and dependency tree to mine the frequent nouns as aspect terms. Based on the extracted aspect terms, Konjengbam also devises an ontology based opinion summarization method in ."

However, they have several limitations: 1) too many non-aspects are produced and lowfrequency aspects are missed; 2) it is hard to adapt manual constructed patterns to another domain. Moreover, such models often ignore the semantic similarity between aspects and generate redundant aspects. For example, 'price', 'cost' and 'fee' are three semantic relatedness aspect terms extracted by the rule-based approaches, and 'cost' and 'fee' are the redundant aspects.",

Therefore, Multi-Grain Topic model is proposed for corpus level aspect extraction. Titov distinguishes the global topics and local topics in MG-LDA. Local topics are used to capture the local aspects and the global properties of the reviewed product will be captured by the global topics. In MG-LDA, a document d is generated from a mixture of global and local topics. Titov employs a set of sliding windows (each window has its particular local topic distribution and constituted by T adjacent sentences) to represent the document. Also, MG-LDA assumes that document d has a fixed global topic distribution and a varies local topic distribution during the generative process. In other words, a sentence s should be generated from the global topic mixture and windows mixture which covers sentence s. Further, the overlap between sliding windows provide a large cooccurrence domain. And the extraction results on two different review corpus (MP3 reviews and Hotel reviews) are shown in . Bold terms, at the beginning of each line, are the aspects extracted from the review collections, italic words behind the colon are the corresponding representative terms of each aspect. And the tokens in each line are sorted by the probability of each term according to the word distribution of specific topic/aspect(e.g. battery, location and pricing) in descend order.",
               "Along this line, scholars have devised some similar topic models - . To model the aspect relationship between different products, Yang assumes that child categories will inherit aspects from parent categories, and the proposed approach incorporates the category hierarchy information into modeling process to enhance the extraction ability. To enhance the coherence of the generated aspect topics, Shams mines knowledge automatically from preextracted topics and proposes an ELDA to inject the knowledge into modeling process.",
               "On the other hand, clustering algorithms are also employed for aspect extraction. For example, group average agglomerative clustering (GAAC) algorithm is employed by Raju . Raju considers both semantic similarity of aspects and the domain specialty. Raju firstly employs the term frequency and KL divergence of term probabilities in two corpus (a domain specific corpus and a general English corpus) to detect the domain aspect candidates. Subsequently, the similarity matrix based on the Dice's Coefficient similarity is built to group the aspect candidates into clusters according to their semantic similarity. Finally, the approach selects the high ranked phrases in each cluster as aspects and gets a competitive Recall : 62%. Inspired by the fact that important aspect are usually commented by a large number of consumers and one's opinion on important aspect could greatly influence their overall opinion on the product, Yu develops an aspect ranking approach which considers both term frequency and the importance of the detected aspect to enhance the performance of aspect extraction.",

To solve the incoherent aspect of the traditional extraction model, He represents document with word embedding and proposes a neural-based aspect extraction model which combines the attention mechanism with reconstruction loss. Likewise, Angelidis employs the limited annotated data to mine the aspect-specific seed words as the prior knowledge of aspect embedding. And with the help of this initialization mechanism, the proposed the model obtains more coherent aspect.",

Commonly, the opinion expressed on the aspect (the third element in the triple) could be described in three types: 1) emotional adjectives are used (e.g.'cool appearance'); 2) two or five star rating (e.g. high rating score means positive opinion); 3). an ordered set of non-numerical labels (e.g. poor, average, good, very good, excellent) is used. Take 'Mac' as an example. The model uses the target 'Mac' and the specific corpus as input and should output the corpus level triples: Example: (Here, we use two level rating 'good' and 'bad') Inputs: A review corpus of Mac generated by users Outputs: < Mac, sound, good>, < Mac, CPU, good>, < Mac, price, bad>, < Mac, screen,good>, < Mac, appearance, good>, < Mac, weight, bad>, and . . .

Hu firstly employs the frequency based approach to extract the product aspects and opinions words. Then, an orientation identification algorithm based on a pre-defined seed set (e.g. a small set of opinion words) and the semantic structure of WordNet are employed to automatically identify the opinion orientation. Similarly, OPINE employs an aspect assessment method based on pointwise mutation information (PMI) and the syntactic dependency rules to improve the quality of extracted aspect terms and opinion expressions. Then, the relaxation labeling is employed by OPINE to detect the orientation of opinion expression in the specific context. To incorporate the external sentiment information, Jiang defines four tree kernels and proposes a tree kernel based approach to incorporate the syntactic dependency and sentiment information. On the other hand, Baccianella views aspect rating as a regression problem and propose an ordinal regression based approach using various features, such as n-grams, POS pattern, General Inquirer .",
               "To explain how the frequency and relation based system works, we choose Opinion Digger as an example. Instead of solely using review corpus, auxiliary information is employed in Opinion Digger. As shown in , the collection contains a set of pre-defined aspect set (e.g. 'Ease of use', 'Durability' and 'Battery life' in ) and a rating guideline (e.g. 'terrible: 1', 'poor: 2', 'average: 3', 'good: 4' and 'excellent: 5') which infers the relationship between opinion words and corresponding numerical ratings. Opinion Digger aims to extract the aspect and opinion terms together with predicting the aspect-specific rating (range from 1 to 5) using corpus and additional information as input. In general, the whole mining process should be divided as aspect extraction phase, opinion extraction phase and the rating prediction phase. In aspect extraction phase, all the noun terms are firstly extracted using the apriori algorithm. Then, a set of POS patterns in review corpus are identified based on the pre-defined aspects. For example, the pattern [_JJ _ASP] (e.g. adjective+aspect) is extracted from the aspect phrase 'long battery life'. And the constructed patterns are used to refine the candidate aspect set. After the aspect extraction phase, aspect specific opinion words are identified based on the nearest rule (e.g. if opinion word modifies the aspect, they should co-occurrence with a small distance). To estimate the aspect specific rating, the system should firstly detect the aspect specific opinion words. For each opinion word, Opinion Digger employs the WordNet synonymy hierarchy to find the two nearest opinion words in rating guideline (e.g.'terrible, 'poor', 'average', 'good' and 'excellent'). For example, 'terrible' and 'poor' are two nearest opinion words of 'defective' and their corresponding ratings could be used to predict the rating score of 'defective'. Further, Opinion Digger predicts the corpus level aspect based rating by aggregating the ratings of the relevant opinion words to the specific aspect.",

To overcome such disadvantages, topic model based approaches have been proposed. And many various of LDA have the ability to perform corpus level aspect extraction and opinion mining in parallel.

By dividing the topics into two categories, aspect topics and opinion topics, separated extraction models output aspects and opinions separately as shown in 'Hotel reviews' in . While jointly extraction model assume that aspect specific terms, both aspect and opinion words, are generated from one aspect related topic, and the example of the output is shown as 'Electronics reviews' in .",
               "To interpret the topic model based mining approaches and their mechanism, we employ the MaxEnt-LDA (e.g. an integration of generative topic model and a discriminative maximum entropy module) as an example which extracts the aspects and opinions in the form of 'Hotel review' shown in . With the usage of a small amount of training corpus, it could extract the aspect words and aspect specific opinion words separately. The MaxEnt-LDA categorizes the topics as background topic t B , global aspect topic t A,g , global opinion topic t O,g , aspect topics t A,i , i{1, 2, 3, . . . , T } and aspect specific opinion topics t O,i , i{1, 2, 3, . . . , T }. Differs from the Latent Dirichlet Allocation, MaxEnt-LDA makes a further assumption that each sentence is assigned to one specific aspect. Namely, each review sentence s is generated from a mixture of background topic (t B ), global topics (both t A,g and t O,g ) and the assigned aspect specific topics (t A,i and t O,i ). In detail, two switch variables u{0, 1} and y{0, 1, 2}, draw from binomial and multinomial distribution, are designed to cooperatively determine the source topic of current word w. The variable u determines the category (background, general or aspect) of w. Due to the deficiency of symmetric dirichlet prior (induced in that fully unsupervised model could not separate opinion words and aspect words efficiently), Zhao uses the part-of-speech information of the context words which is helpful for distinguishing the aspect word and opinion word as features and designs a maximum entropy classifier to determine y for the current word w. And the model parameters could be learned from a small domain independent training corpus (annotated with background, aspect and opinion). Combing the advantages of generative model and supervised information of pre-trained ME-classifier, MaxEnt-LDA naturally encodes the external information (e.g. lexical features and POS tags) into the model. And the side information really contributes to the aspect and aspect-specific opinion mining."

Thus, Moghddam models this interdependence and proposes the ILDA which follows the assumption of bag of opinions phrases (e.g.< screen, bright>, < battery life, long>) to enhance the extraction ability. To combine the label information with the unsupervised extraction model, Brody employs the seed set automatic construction and sentiment propagation mechanisms to identify the aspect based opinion. Furthermore, to capture the syntax and semantics relations between words, Lakkaraju assumes that word category is conditioned on previous word and employs the hidden markov model to capture the short-range syntactic structure and long range semantic dependencies.",

Ekinci incorporates a ranking mechanism into LDA and proposes an approach for aspect-sentiment pair extraction in Turkish language corpus. To use complementary information provided by different type online media, Zuo propose a cross-collection topic modeling approach for aspect and opinion mining. In , Jo firstly proposes a SLDA which assumes that all words in a sentence are generated from a single aspect due to the observation that one sentence in a review tends to express opinion on one aspect. Moreover, Jo extends the SLDA and proposes the Aspect and Sentiment Unification Model (ASUM) which views one topic as an aspect coupled with an opinion (called senti-aspect topic). Likewise, ASUM also follows the constrain that all words in a specific sentence should be generated from one topic. With the extracted corpus-level senti-aspect topics, the topic distribution could be employed to predict the sentiment polarity of a review.",

Xiao combines the matrix factorization with topic modeling and proposes a model for aspect rating prediction.",

Thus, he exploits the relationship between aspect based ratings and the overall rating and develops a latent aspect rating analysis model. The proposed approach could not only extract the latent aspects and aspect specific opinions jointly but also provide the aspect weight for each user generated review without any supervision."

               "Here, we use Jin's model as an example to illustrate the extraction process of document/sentence level the aspect and opinion mining. To incorporate the extra linguistic lexical features into HMM, Jin employs the POS tags and lexical patterns and proposes the Lexicalized HMM which is shown in . The objective of the proposed system could be described as: given a review (word sequence) R = r 1 , r 2 , . . . , r n and the corresponding POS tag sequence S = s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s n , the task is to predict the suitable tag sequencT = t 1 , t 2 , . . . , t n that could maximize the conditional probability P(T |R, S). To simplify the approach and make it computable, three assumptions have been made: i) the current tag t i only depends on the previous tag t i?1 and the word w i?1 ; ii) the probability of current word w i only depends on the current POS tag s i and the previous word w i?1 ; iii) the probability of current POS s i only depends on the current tag t i and the previous word w i?1 . Based on these approximations, when given an annotated training corpus, model parameters could be estimated by maximum likelihood estimation. To further reduce the human labor in training corpus construction phase, Jin employs a bootstrap program with information propagation mechanism to automatically generate the annotated reviews by using a small annotated corpus as seed corpus. Finally, the system employs the viterbi algorithm to generate the optimal tag sequencT for each test review. For example, the sentence ''I love the ease of transferring the pictures to my computer.'' could be tagged as ''< BG> I < /BG> < OPINION_POS_EXP> love</OPINION_POS_EXP> < BG> the< /BG> < PROD_FEAT>ease of transferring the pictures< /PROD_FEAT> < BG> to< /BG> < BG> my < /BG> < BG > computer< /BG>.'' Thus, the aspect 'ease of transferring the picture' and opinion 'love' could be extracted.",
               "On the other hand, CRF-based approaches have also been proposed. Due to the simplicity, the linear chain CRF is commonly used. However, the relation between neighbor context will not be sufficient for the sophisticated aspect and opinion mining task. Thus, Skip-chain CRFs is employed for the task, and it could model the long distance dependency between conjunctions (e.g. only consider 'adjective', 'noun' and 'verb'). For example, in the sentence ''iPhoneX has a great camera and a cool appearance'', two long distance dependencies (dep(great, cool) and dep(camera, appearance)) could be captured by Skip-chain CRFs. Furthermore, Li also proposes the Skip-tree CRFs which incorporates the syntactic tree structure into the CRF framework and outperforms traditional CRF. And the proposed Skip-tree CRF has good expansibility that external features (e.g. semantic dependency tree and sentiment lexicons) could be naturally encoded. Likewise, Jakob proposes a CRF-based approach with various features (e.g. token, partof-speech, short dependency path, word distance and etc) to perform opinion target extraction task in both single-domain and cross-domain setting. Moreover, scholars claim that if the system has performed aspect extraction from many past domain and stores the result as knowledge it will be helpful for improving the extraction performance on other domain corpus. Based on the assumption, Shu incorporates the lifelong learning into CRF and the proposed approach performs markedly better than the traditional CRF. To capture the semantic relatedness from multiple source embedding, Xiang employs multi-feature embedding as additional position feature to train a CRF-based tagger, and the MFE-CRF also outperforms the traditional CRF.",
               "Besides, a novel attempt of combining the traditional CRF with deep neural network has been proposed in , named Recursive Neural CRFs. The RNCRF contains a dependencytree RNN and a Condition Random Field as output layer. Combining the superiority of representative presentation learnt by neural network and the CRF, the proposed RNCRF outperforms the traditional CRFs and needs less human intervention for designing appropriate features."

Fortunately, deep learning approaches - , - , - , , , (e.g. CNN, RNN and LSTM) have also contributed to the advances in document level aspect and opinion mining task. Due to the strong representation ability of deep learning and related techniques (e.g. word embeddings), a mass of deep learning based approaches employ word embedding as the text feature to capture the semantic meaning of token in this specific task. As summarized in , last twelve rows list the deep learning based approaches for aspect and opinion tagging. The detailed discussion will be given in this subsection.",
               "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) which could tackle variable length input sequence have shown great promise in many sequential labeling tasks. To illustrate the tagging process of the deep learning based approach, we use the model proposed in as example. depicts the structure of the devised network. For encoding the semantic relatedness of tokens, Liu trains a task specific embeddings using CBOW model on an amazon review corpus which contains 34M reviews. And the proposed approach also employs a window-based mechanism to capture the local dependency at the input layer. For example, if the window size is set to 3, the 'disk' shown in should be represented by the vector which is the concatenation of the embeddings corresponding to 'hard', 'disk', 'is'. Besides, Liu finds that the future information may be crucial for predicting the tag current word(e.g. when given the bi-gram 'hard disk', the observation of 'disk' will be helpful for assigning a 'B-TARG' for 'hard'). To capture the long distance dependencies of two directions, both forward and backward, in text sequence, the proposed approach employs a bi-directional LSTM to learn the high level distributed representation of the input word sequence and outperforms the CRF-based approaches which employs sophisticated handcrafted feature. Furthermore, it has a strong expandability and the linguistic features (e.g. part-of-speech tags) could be incorporated into the model by concatenating it with the output of LSTM unit (shown in , and f i means the POS tag of x i and the learned weights are helpful for tagging.",
               "Likewise, other variant RNN-based tagging approaches have been proposed - . As we know, the syntactic relation between aspect terms and opinion terms is useful for extracting aspect and opinion. To model such relations, devises a multi-layer attention based network with coupled attention, one attention is for extracting aspect terms and the other is for opinion terms. And the proposed model could further exploit indirect relations between terms for more precise information extraction through multiple layers attention mechanism. Yu views the aspect and opinion extraction in a multi-task manner. To directly model the intertask constrain, intra-task constrain and lexicon constrain, Yu formulate the problem as an Integer Liner Programming and devises a global inference approach to extraction aspect and opinion terms jointly. Li exploit two useful clues (opinion summary and aspect detection history) and proposes an approach based on the history attention.",
               "On the other hand, scholars have also proposed several CNN-based approaches to extract aspect and opinion terms in document level. Poria proposes a CNN based approach which incorporates linguistic patterns into neural network. Firstly, the approach uses a 7-layer deep CNN which combines with word embeddings and window mechanism to label each term in review with task specific tags. Then, five linguistic patterns are also employed to tag aspect term. Finally, the model uses a voting mechanism which considers the tags generated by CNN and patterns to judge if a term is an aspect or not. To capture the dependency information (which is critical and has been widely used in the field) in reviews, a dependency-tree based convolutional stacked neural network is proposed in . The proposed approach has strong representation ability and could effectively exploit the dependency relations resort to its elaborated structure. Furthermore, Xu claims that aspect extraction is a complex task that also requires fine-grained domain knowledge. To make full use of domain knowledge, Xu employs two form of embedding (general-purpose embeddings and domainspecific embeddings) to capture more useful information and proposes the DE-CNN for aspect extraction.",
               "Besides, another group of approaches which focus on the cross-domain and cross-lingual scenarios have also been proposed. Inspired by the idea of learning a suitable representation for both source and target domains could be helpful for domain adaptation, Ding firstly uses the auxiliary label sequences generated by syntactic rules to train a hidden recurrent neural network using both domain corpus. Then, the hidden layer is trained on source domain corpus using aspect and opinion annotations as supervision. By taking advantage of neural based supervised models and relation-based rules, the proposed approach achieves F score : 50.2% which outperforms the traditional sequential models. Likewise, employs a recursive neural structural network to capture the syntactic relation between words, and the proposed SNSCN-GRU could efficiently reduce the domain shift and obtains a good performance in cross-domain extraction. To tackle the multi-lingual scenarios, utilizes transitionbased mechanism that reads a word each time and forms a series of configurations (represented as a continuous feature vector) that represent the status of the whole sentence. And the configurations from different languages are aligned into a shared space through an adversarial network to transfer the knowledge to target language. The model, proposed in , obtains F score : 51.49%.",
               "Although it's not fair to directly compare the performance of the models in 8 due to the difference of the used datasets, we also have some findings. i). Models that focus on cross-domain and cross-lingual scenarios often obtain worse results compared with the in-domain tagging task, this is caused by the knowledge gap between different domains and languages; ii). Deep learning based tagging models that employ attention mechanism (such as history attention and coupled attention) often get better performance. This may because that attention mechanism could let the model care more about aspect and opinion terms which could further improve the extraction performance. iii). There is another trend that scholars prefer to combine traditional sequential models (such as condition random field) and syntactic patterns with neural based models. As deep neural networks have strong representative ability and traditional models could provide handcrafted features and syntactic features, this combination will make the model benefit from both strategies and promote the performance. iv). Word embedding is a critical technique for neural based extraction models. Under the help of word relatedness which retained in word embedding, neural based approaches perform better than traditional models."

However, stance detection aims to identify the stance of each reviews on the specific target (e.g. ''The pregnant are more than walking incubators.'' express the favor stance for the target 'legalization of abortion'). Thus, the existing lexicons which just collect positive words and negative words are not suitable for the task.
