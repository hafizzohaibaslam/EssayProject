Markov chains have recently been used to model user navigational behavior on the World Wide Web (WWW). In this paper, we propose a method for constructing a Markov model of a Web site based on past visitor behavior. We use the Markov model to make link predictions that assist new users to navigate the Web site. An algorithm for transition probability matrix compression has been used to cluster Web pages with similar transition behaviors and compress the transition matrix to an optimal size for efficient probability calculation in link prediction. A maximal forward path method is used to further improve the efficiency of link prediction. Link prediction has been implemented in an online system called ONE (Online Navigation Explorer) to assist users' navigation in the adaptive Web site."

The link structure is then used to build a Markov model of the Web site. A traditional method for constructing the link structure is Web crawling, in which a Web indexing program is used to build an index by following hyperlinks continuously from Web page to Web page. Weights are then assigned to the links based on users' traversals . This method has two drawbacks. One is that some irrelevant pages and links, such as pages outside the current Web site and links never traversed by users, are inevitably included in the link structure, and need to be filtered out. Another is that the Webmaster can set up the Web site to exclude the crawler from crawling into some parts of the Web site for various reasons. We propose to use the link information contained in an ECLF (Extended Common Log File)  format log file to construct a link structure, called a link graph. Our approach has two advantages over crawling-based methods. Only relevant pages and links are used for link graph construction, and all the pages relevant to users' visits are included in the link graph.",

A record in an ECLF log file might look like as shown in The records of embedded objects in the Web pages, including graphical, video, and audio files, are treated as redundant requests and removed, since every request of a Web page will initiate a series of requests of all the embedded objects in it automatically. The records of unsuccessful requests are also discarded as erroneous records, since there may be bad links, missing or temporarily inaccessible documents, or unauthorized requests etc. In our approach, only the URIs of the requested Web page and the corresponding referrer are used for link graph construction. We therefore have a simplified set r WL ={( , r u )}, where r and u are the URIs of the referrer and the requested page respectively. Since various users may have followed the same links in their visits, the traversals of these links are aggregated to get a set s WL ={( , , r u w)}, where w is the number of traversals from r to u . In most cases a link is the hyperlink from r to u . When \"-\" is in the referrer field, we assume there is a virtual link from \"-\" to the requested page.

In order to ensure that there is a directed path between any two nodes in the link graph, we add a link from the \"Exit\" node to the \"Start\" node. Due to the influence of caching, the amount of weights on all incoming links of a page might not be the same as the amount of weights on all outgoing links. To solve this problem, we can either assign extra incoming weights to the link to the start/exit node or distribute extra outgoing weights to the incoming links.  shows a link graph we have constructed using a Web log file at the University of Ulster Web site, in which the title of each page is shown beside the node representing the page.

Compared with Sarukkai's method, our method can predict more steps in the future, and thus provide more insight into the future.

After discarding the irrelevant records, we get 423,739 records. In order to rule out the possibility that some links are only interesting to individual users, we set a threshold as the minimum number of traversals on each hyperlink as 10 and there must be three or more users who have traversed the hyperlink. We assume each originating machine corresponds to a different user. These may not always be true when such as proxy servers exist. But in the absence of user tracking software, the method can still provide rather reliable results. We then construct a link graph consisting of 2175 nodes, and 3187 links between the nodes. The construction process takes 26 minutes on a Pentium 3 desktop, with a 600 MHz CPU, 128M RAM. The maximum number of traversals on a link in the link graph is 101,336, which is on the link from the \"Start\" node to the homepage of the Web site. The maximum and average numbers of links in a page in the link graph are 75 and 1.47 respectively. The maximum number of in-links of a page in the link graph is 57.",

By setting six different thresholds for compression, we get the experimental results given in :   We then use the compressed transition matrix for link prediction. Link prediction is integrated with a prototype called ONE (Online Navigation Explorer) to assist users' navigation in our university Web site. ONE provides the user with informative and focused recommendations and the flexibility of being able to move around within the history and recommended pages. The average time needed for updating the recommendations is under 30 seconds, so it is suitable for online navigation, given the response can be speeded up with the current computational capability of many commercial Web sites. We selected m =5 and n =5 in link prediction to take into account five history vectors in the past and five steps in the future. We computed 2 Q ,��, 9 Q for link prediction. The initial feedback from our group members is very positive. They have spent less time to find interested information using ONE than not using ONE in our university Web site. They have more successfully found the information useful to them using ONE than not using ONE. So users' navigation has been effectively speeded up using ONE. ONE presents a list of Web pages as the user's visiting history along with the recommended pages updated while the user traverses the Web site. Each time when a user requests a new page, probabilities of visiting any other Web pages or page clusters within the next n steps are calculated. Then the Web pages and clusters with the highest probabilities are highlighted in the ONE window. The user can browse the clusters and pages like in the Windows Explorer. Icons are used to represent different states of pages and clusters. Like the Windows Explorer, ONE allows the user to activate pages, expand clusters. Each page is given its title to describe the contents in the page.",

User's navigation is regarded as a Markov chain for link analysis. The transition probabilities are calculated from the accumulated access records of past users. Compared with his method, we have three major contributions. We have compressed the transition matrix to an optimal size to save the computation time of 1 m n Q + ? , which can save a lot of time and resources given the large number of Web pages on a modern Web site. We have improved the link prediction calculation by taking into account more steps in the future to provide more insight into the future. We have proposed to use Maximal Forward Path method to improve the accuracy of link prediction results by eliminating the effect of backward references by users. The \"Adaptive Web Sites\" approach has been proposed by Perkowitz and Etzioni . Adaptive Web sites are Web sites which can automatically change their presentation and organization to assist users' navigation by learning from Web usage data. Perkowitz and Etzioni proposed the PageGather algorithm to generate index pages composed of Web pages most often associated with each other in users' visits from Web usage data to evaluate a Web site's organization and assist users' navigation .",

The index page is based on co-occurrence of pages in users' past visits and does not take into account users' visiting history. The index page is a static recommendation. Our method has taken into account users' history to make link prediction. The link prediction is dynamic to reflect the changing interests of the users. (2) In PageGather, it is assumed that each originating machine corresponds to a single user. The assumption can be undermined by proxy servers, dynamic IP allocations, which are both common on the WWW. Our method treats a user group as a whole without the identification of individual users and thus is more robust to these influences. However, computation is needed in link prediction and the recommendations can not respond as quickly as the index page, which can be directly retrieved from a Web server. Spears  proposed a transition matrix compression algorithm based on transition behaviors of the states in the matrix. Transition matrices calculated from systems, which are being modeled in too many details, can be compressed for smaller state spaces while the transition behaviors of the states are preserved. The algorithm has been used to measure the transition similarities between pages in our work and compress the probability transition matrix to an optimal size for efficient link prediction.",

Brusilovsky  gave a comprehensive review of the state of the art in adaptive hypermedia research. Adaptive hypermedia includes adaptive presentation and adaptive navigation support . Adaptive Web sites can be seen as a kind of adaptive presentation of Web sites to assist users' navigation.",

The link prediction can be further improved by identifying users' goal in each visit .  Link prediction in ONE needs to be evaluated by a larger user group. We plan to select a group of users including students, staff in our university, and people from outside our university to use ONE. Their interaction with ONE will be logged for analysis.  We plan to use Web log files from some commercial Web site to build a Markov model for link prediction and evaluate the results on different user groups.",
