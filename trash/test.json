Viral marketing propagates influence through 'word-of-mouth' effect. As for development of viral marketing, it is critical to select a set of influential users in the network to propagate influence as much as possible with limited resources. In this paper, we proposed a model called Preference-based Trust Independent Cascade (PTIC) Model. Based on the experimental results, the PTIC Model is able to obtain better results than some traditional models. Comparing with other existing methods, such as trust-only approach and random selection approach , the proposed PTIC Model considers both user preference and trust connectivity."

Influence maximization has become a popular topic for researchers in both computer science and business. The solution for influence maximization problem is NP-hard. Hence, some approximation approaches are considered as a replacement. Most of the existing approaches, such as basic diffusion models , only consider about propagation links/channels in influence maximization (called trust connectiv-ity (TC) in this paper). For instance, assuming there are two users following each other on Twitter. In this situation, the two users have TC between each other. By considering TC only, influence maximization will be treated as a simplified probabilistic problem. Furthermore, influence probabilities are predefined and static, which is not suitable for dynamic environments in many real world applications. Meanwhile, in a social network, users' preferences to particular items also play an important role in influence maximization . Unfortunately, this factor was not considered in most of the existing influence maximization approaches.",

It takes advantage of the integration of the modularity optimization approaches and the density-based clustering. The remarkable merits of the Shrink algorithm are that it can detect not only clusters, but also the structure of the network, i.e., the hubs and the outliers. Another HC algorithm is a community partition method based on node similarity proposed by Ying el al. . In the algorithm, each node is initialized as a community in the network at the beginning. Then, communities are merged iteratively based on neighbourhood similarity. Ying et al's approach has lower computational complexity and has been applied for many types of networks, indicating that this algorithm is effective and efficient for community detection.",

In addition, the influence probabilities are predefined and static. Secondly, user preference plays a critical part in influence maximization, since users with common preferences can easier influence each other.

There are four modules in the PTIC Model, i.e., the Common Preference Similarity Computation Module (CPSCM), the Community Partition Module (CPM), the Trust Connectivity Computation Module (TCCM), and the Seed Selection Module (SSM). At the beginning of this model, CPSs (refer to Definition 4) between users will be computed and evaluated by the CPSCM. The computation of CPS can be regarded as the preparation of the CPM since CPS is the weight labelled on the preference edge. After the computation of CPS, the CPM will be conducted. Users will be partitioned into communities based on CPS. In addition, user distance will be computed based on user profiles as trust connectivity in the TCCM. Finally, the SSM will be conducted based on the output of CPM and the TCCM. ",

Hence, our model is able to maximize influence based on user preference and trust connectivity within limited resources efficiently. We implement the PTIC Model based on IC Model. In the future, we are going to implement this model in other diffusion models, such as, LT Model . In addition, we will consider trust relationship between users as directed.",
