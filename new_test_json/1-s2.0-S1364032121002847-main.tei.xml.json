               "Microgrids have recently emerged as a building block for smart grids combining distributed renewable energy sources (RESs), energy storage devices, and load management methodologies. The intermittent nature of RESs brings several challenges to the smart microgrids, such as reliability, power quality, and balance between supply and demand. Thus, forecasting power generation from RESs, such as wind turbines and solar panels, is becoming essential for the efficient and perpetual operations of the power grid and it also helps in attaining optimal utilization of RESs. Energy demand forecasting is also an integral part of smart microgrids that helps in planning the power generation and energy trading with commercial grid. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based models are promising solutions for predicting consumers' demands and energy generations from RESs. In this context, this manuscript provides a comprehensive survey of the existing DL-based approaches, which are developed for power forecasting of wind turbines and solar panels as well as electric power load forecasting. It also discusses the datasets used to train and test the different DL-based prediction models, enabling future researchers to identify appropriate datasets to use in their work. Even though there are a few related surveys regarding energy management in smart grid applications, they are focused on a specific production application such as either solar or wind. Moreover, none of the surveys review the forecasting schemes for production and load side simultaneously. Finally, previous surveys do not consider the datasets used for forecasting despite their significance in DL-based forecasting approaches. Hence, our survey work is intrinsically different due to its data-centered view, along with presenting DL-based applications for load and energy generation forecasting in both residential and commercial sectors. The comparison of different DL approaches discussed in this manuscript reveals that the efficiency of such forecasting methods is highly dependent on the amount of the historical data and thus a large number of data storage devices and high processing power devices are required to deal with big data. Finally, this study raises several open research problems and opportunities in the area of renewable energy forecasting for smart microgrids."

               "The power sector is moving towards renewable energy sources (RESs) because of their low price and massive contributions in reduction of carbon emissions. RESs consist of a number of resources, which include bioenergy, wind energy, hydropower, photovoltaic (PV) energy, etc. Usually, these RESs are operated in islanded and grid-connected modes . Solar and wind energies are generated by installing PV panels and wind turbines (WTs), respectively, and these are handy in most places around the globe. Besides, RESs play an important role in minimizing carbon emissions among various electricity sources , as shown in . Moreover, indicates the yearly proportion of renewable power contribution to the whole electricity generation of some leading countries of the world. Brazil generates a huge amount of power from renewable sources (see ) in order to meet the consumers' power demand. Solar panels convert direct sunlight to electrical energy, while WTs generate electric power from wind. The key characteristics of these energy sources are limited controllability, limited predictability, and power output variability as the power produced from RESs completely relies upon environmental factors like solar irradiance, temperature, humidity, and wind speed . For example, PV panels produce higher energy in case of high solar radiation (clear sky) and they generate minimum energy (may be 0) during cloudy weather or at night times. On the contrary, WTs generate minimum energy (may be zero) in case of lower and higher wind speed than cut-in and cut-out speed, respectively . Thus, large fluctuations in power generation from PV plants and WTs introduce several challenges, including voltage irregulations as well as reserve power flow problems and power distribution issues . To make matters worse, energy consumers also exhibit intermittent behavior in power consumption because of various factors, like environmental changes, user preferences, etc.",
               "As mentioned above, the integration of RESs complicate the power grid operations and microgrids introduce difficulties in maintaining balance between energy generation and consumption (see for microgrid architecture). Therefore, accurate forecasting of energy generation from RESs (i.e., PV panels and WTs) along with electric load forecasting is an exigent need of the current smart grid era. Accurate load/demand forecasting allows the utility companies to control demand-driven supply effectively and produce surplus power from other resources (traditional power generation portfolios) when RESs are unable to meet consumers' demand.",
               "Reliable prediction of wind and solar power generation form WTs and solar panels, respectively, is a challenging task, as it relies entirely on weather patterns (e.g., humidity, temperature, irradiance, etc.) . Forecasting can be performed using several methods, including physical models , machine learning (ML) , and (more recently) deep learning (DL) . In the last decade, ML and DL approaches have been applied in several domains of computational intelligence and forecasting, where they demonstrated promising efficacy. For example, they are employed for energy optimization and forecasting in smart microgrids , energy prediction in wheat production , health services improvements , performance improvement in wireless networks , flood management , and hydrogen production forecasting . However, all the forecasting methods have their own pros and cons. For instance, physical methods are effective in predicting the dynamics of the atmosphere, but they need significant computational resources since a huge amount of data is required to calibrate the dynamics of the atmosphere. Further issues arise when physical approaches find unexpected estimation errors, while they are also not suitable for short-term forecasting horizons. Similarly, most of the current renewable energy prediction statistical models are designed as linear models, which limits their ability to solve more complex forecasting issues with longer forecasting time horizons.",
               "Contrary to physical models, ML-based forecasting approaches usually offer more accurate results than statistical and physical models due to their advanced data mining and feature extraction capabilities. However, as a general rule, ML-based forecasting approaches use some \"shallow\" models as their central learning concepts. Typical shallow patterns are trees, regressors, or neural networks with zero or one hidden layer. It is well known that the training of such shallow models requires a great deal of experience and skill. Moreover, the theoretical study of shallow structures is often challenging. Thus, in practical applications, shallow models have significant drawbacks. However, it has been recently established that DL-based energy generation and power load forecasting approaches outperform the aforementioned methods since, unlike ML-based approaches, DL-based approaches do not suffer from hand-engineered feature selection, sample complexity, and weak generalization efficiency .",
               "Even though the forecasting of load demand and energy from RESs is a new research area, it has already gained significant attention from the research community. Lately, a lot of research studies have proposed DLbased approaches for such forecasting, while several survey/review works have been conducted , where they attempted to survey DL methods for energy or load forecasting from various perspectives and scopes. For instance, some recent survey papers present an overview of microgrid and RESs, such as solar power, wind energy, geothermal energy, hydro energy, etc. . The work presented in Ref. reviews ten major ML models that were frequently employed in energy systems. A brief review of the load monitoring (LM) strategies is discussed in Ref. . Surveys of building energy consumption prediction and overview of ML methods are given in Refs. . A review study presented in Ref. discusses DL-based methods for solar irradiance prediction, while the papers disclose recent studies on both solar and wind energy forecasting using DL/ML methods. A more detailed discussion about state-of-the-art survey works is presented in Section 2 and . List of abbreviations is given in of this manuscript.",
               "However, the existing studies only review either some particular topics or consider a specific issue. There is no survey/review study that considers a broad involvement of DL methods in smart microgrids in simultaneous ways, e.g., load forecasting and energy generation prediction from photovoltaic and wind turbines. In addition, none of the existing surveys review datasets that were employed for load and energy forecasting. The above motivate us to deliver this study with a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art DL-based approaches developed to forecast the power generation from WTs and solar panels, along with the forecasting of load demand of consumers. Various datasets reported in the literature for the prediction of wind speed/energy and solar irradiance/ energy are also presented in this study. Our comprehensive review and analysis makes this manuscript useful for beginners as well as experts working in this domain. This study further helps the reader in tracking datasets used by researchers and developing real-world forecasting applications. Finally, this study can serve as a technical reference for comparison and selection of effective and efficient forecasting strategies.",
               "The rest of the manuscript is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses past surveys in the area of energy management systems (EMSs) and highlights our contributions. Section 3 outlines the methodology of this survey. Section 4 offers a summary of the main DL techniques, while Section 5 describes the use of DL in EMSs and various forecasting models. This section also reviews the datasets that are used to train and test the reviewed DL-based forecasting models. Section 6 investigates the potential issues of the existing DL-based approaches. Finally, the last section concludes the survey."

Different activation functions, like Sigmoid, Rectified Linear Unit, and Softmax, are used for computation within the ANNs.

For instance, RNNs make decisions at time step t on the bases of t ? 1 and t. This type of RNN characteristics makes it able to efficiently solve the load forecasting and energy generation prediction of solar/wind energy sources. Moreover, RNNs are trained by backpropagation through time . However, long-range learning is difficult with RNNs because of exploding or gradient vanishing problems .",
               "To solve the aforementioned problems in RNNs, Hochreiter et al. introduced long short term memory (LSTM) by including a memory cell , which was further enhanced by adding an extra forget gate . LSTM is considered to be one of the most efficient NN architectures for time-series forecasting and modeling. Conventional NNs learn the correspondence among input and output from a static perspective. However, information is lost when time-series data is independently trained as input and output of NNs. The RNN makes a link between each pair of A deep belief network (DBN) contains multiple restricted boltzmann machines (RBMs) that are considered primary elements of the DBN . The RBM is an updated form of a boltzmann machine by adding node connections. The RBM contains two key layers, namely visible and hidden layers. Moreover, DBN uses both supervised and unsupervised learning. In particular, unsupervised learning is used in the pre-training phase, whereas supervised learning is exploited in the fine-tuning phase. Selection of appropriate initial parameters, weights, and bias is performed by unsupervised learning using independent variables. In this way, the pre-training stage rebuilds training samples by tuning variables to enhance likelihood estimation. Supervised learning further tunes the weights and bias on the basis of initial parameters that are given by the pre-training stage. Overall, DBN networks train differently compared to DNNs and ANNs as they use energy-based training functions to propagate data throughout the unsupervised training mode. Based on a past critical analysis , DBN is highly capable to deal with similar image data; however, it has high computational complexity. presents a DBN model with L number of layers, where the input and output layers are presented on the left and right sides, respectively.",

The terms W hx , W yh , and W hh denote the matrices of weights, which show the relationship between h and x, y and h, and h and h, respectively. Furthermore, unlike simple RNN, the LSTM has two hidden states h t and c t to capture the long-term dependencies. Hidden states h t and c t are designed to keep the short-term and long-term information, respectively. The hidden state c has an additional mechanism that helps LSTM to strategically forget unnecessary information. LSTM has introduced three control gates to keep the information for the long-term, as presented in . The LSTM is capable to solve vanishing gradient problems and make shorter the pre-processing of data . The main drawbacks of LSTMs are: they need huge amount of resources to deal with big data, training process is very difficult, and they need high memory-bandwidth because of the linear layers present in each cell, which makes them inefficient .",

RNN solves this problem and it takes input sequentially. It includes feedback connections in the hidden layer units, as opposed to other feed-forward NNs. RNN will, therefore, undergo temporal processing and learn sequentially. In addition, the RNN exploits a hidden layer as a memory in order to store sequential information, unlike other NNs. In addition, the RNN employes the same parameters (U, V, W) for each layer, as opposed to conventional DNNs that use different parameters for each layer (see ).

In order to comprehend the DL working, it is necessary to first understand uncertainty quantification. For instance, the DL methodology starts with the collection of more appropriate datasets, selection of an appropriate DL model based on performance goals, training the model by employing a labeled dataset, and optimization of various learning parameters that will help in achieving satisfactory performance. There exist multiple uncertainties involved in the DL steps, which need to be quantified. For instance, they include selection/collection of training data, accuracy and completeness of training data, comprehending the DL models along with their performance bounds and limitations, as well as uncertainties based on operational data . The primary objective of uncertainty quantification is to disclose reliable confidence scores for forecasting results that are generated by DL approaches and what the DL method has not learned properly. In the energy management and forecasting area, the uncertainty quantification has attracted noticeable attention from research community in last couple of years. Current studies show its applications and advantages, i.e., energy management application in smart grid , and uncertainty quantification in wind power forecasting . Hence, this area still remains open for future work in order to enhance the reliability and accuracy of DL models.",
               "contrary, by employing the pruning approach, a number of neurons along with hidden layers are removed from the DL architecture. Both the growing and pruning approaches-based architectures repeat three key operations until acceptable performance is achieved : (i) training the model, (ii) changing weights based on growing or pruning criteria, and (iii) retraining the model. In the last couple of years, the field of growing and pruning in DL models has earned huge attention from the research community and several studies have discussed its effectiveness in various research domains, including speech emotion recognition , self care activities , and health services enhancement . Hence, the implementation of growing and pruning approaches for DL models in energy management and forecasting area are still an open direction for researchers and industry."

               "Growing and pruning are novel approaches that can be employed to enhance the accuracy and reduce computational complexity of DL models. In this approach, first, a DL architecture is designed with least necessary hidden layers and neurons. Then, new layers and neurons are built in the architecture by applying the growing approach. On the It is observed from current literature that DL methods are commonly adopted for day-ahead and real-time forecasting from solar and wind energy sources. However, there exist several sources of renewable energy other than solar and wind, for instance, hydro energy, geothermal energy, ocean energy, and bio energy . Although ML-and DL-based methods can be applied in these energy sources, their applications for energy prediction are scarce. For example, ML and DL approaches have been employed for geothermal map generation , site location modeling for geo thermal , scheduling of hydropower plant , sea-level variation forecasting for ocean energy , output voltage forecasting in geothermal energy , and density prediction in bio energy . However, all of the aforementioned works are 6-26 years old, and fairly outdated. Therefore, forecasting of energy from geothermal, bio, and other RESs by single and hybrid DL approaches is an unexplored area with a potentially significant research value."

               "The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources leads to unreliable energy generation from renewable energy sources, which ultimately necessitate research regarding renewable energy forecasting. Reliable forecasting of solar and wind power can help in improving the quality of service and efficient power management. ML-and DL-based forecasting techniques are considered effective and efficient methodologies for energy forecasting that utilize historical data. In this survey, we performed comprehensive state-of-the-art literature review regarding energy and load forecasting using DL-based techniques. The scope of a set of forecasting models is reviewed in terms of energy types (i.e., wind energy and solar energy), building types (i.e., commercial and noncommercial buildings), and temporal granularities of forecasting (i.e., 5-min, 10-min, 15-min, 30-min, and hourly). Furthermore, the properties of the datasets that are used for training and testing forecasting models are also investigated, including data types (i.e., benchmark data, real-time data, and simulation data), dataset features (i.e., data origin, features related to indoor environmental conditions and outdoor weather conditions), dataset recording step (i.e., 10-min, 15-min, 30-min, and hourly), and dataset sizes (i.e., total time duration). The . Comparison of different load forecasting methods that were implemented on two datasets (taken from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) ). performance levels of studied models are also summarized in terms of forecast accuracy . Each DL-based forecasting model has its own advantages and disadvantages in predicting wind energy, solar energy, and load forecasting; thus, it is difficult to determine which is the best among all the models. However, our findings suggest that for all the forecasting applications under consideration, hybrid DL algorithms achieve a high level of performance in terms of prediction accuracy. Moreover, hybrid DL schemes exhibit more tolerance to data incompleteness as compared to pure DNN-based DL. Despite the many advances in DL-based forecasting, a large set of challenges remain unresolved that motivate interesting future research directions, including DL with huge amount of data, lowering computational cost and complexity, spatiotemporal forecasting, mobility due to emerging applications, uncertainty quantification, and use of pruned DL models in smart microgrids."
