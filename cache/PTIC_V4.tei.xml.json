               "With the development of social network, online marketing has become more popular and developed in an unprecedented scale. Viral marketing propagates influence through 'word-of-mouth' effect. As for development of viral marketing, it is critical to select a set of influential users in the network to propagate influence as much as possible with limited resources. In this paper, we proposed a model called Preference-based Trust Independent Cascade (PTIC) Model. Based on the experimental results, the PTIC Model is able to obtain better results than some traditional models. Comparing with other existing methods, such as trust-only approach and random selection approach , the proposed PTIC Model considers both user preference and trust connectivity."

               "With the development of online social networks and e-marketplace, it is essential to understand how to propagate and maximize influence to users with limited resources, namely, influence maximization . Influence maximization has become a popular topic for researchers in both computer science and business. The solution for influence maximization problem is NP-hard. Hence, some approximation approaches are considered as a replacement. Most of the existing approaches, such as basic diffusion models , only consider about propagation links/channels in influence maximization (called trust connectiv-ity (TC) in this paper). For instance, assuming there are two users following each other on Twitter. In this situation, the two users have TC between each other. By considering TC only, influence maximization will be treated as a simplified probabilistic problem. Furthermore, influence probabilities are predefined and static, which is not suitable for dynamic environments in many real world applications. Meanwhile, in a social network, users' preferences to particular items also play an important role in influence maximization . Unfortunately, this factor was not considered in most of the existing influence maximization approaches.",
               "In order to cover the aforementioned limitations in existing approaches, in this paper, a Preference-based Trust Independent Cascade (PTIC) Model is proposed. The PTIC Model takes into account not only TC but also user preference. The influence probability in PTIC Model is computed based on user preference and TC. So that, hub users in a social network, who are interested in promoted items, can be selected as influential users. Through this way, the effectiveness and efficiency of influence maximization can be greatly improved. Experimental results also demonstrate that the PTIC Model has a better performance compared with some existing classic models.",
               "The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, some related work has been reviewed. Section 3 presents the problem description and formal definitions related to the PTIC Model. In Section 4, the framework of the PTIC Model is described in details. Experiments are presented in Section 5. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 6."

Kempe et al. are the earliest to research influence maximization as a discrete optimization problem . They have demonstrated that the solution for influence maximization problem is NP-hard. Finding the solution for a NP-hard problem is very difficult. Thus, instead of finding the solution for a NP-hard problem, approximation approaches are better replacement with guarantee.",
               "There are two fundamental models for influence diffusion, i.e., the Linear Threshold (LT) Model and the Independent Cascade (IC) Model. Many studies are developed based on these two models. . However, network analysis approaches, such as, community partition, are not involved in the scalable heuristic algorithm. Community partition can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of influence maximization in a further step. As for the degree discount heuristics, it is efficient but it is sensitive when the influence probabilities are small only. In the real world, it is difficult to influence users with a small probability.",

By considering user preference, users in a social network can be clustered into different community partitions based on their common preferences. Furthermore, hierarchical communities can be identified in a network based on hierarchical clustering (HC), also called hierarchical clustering analysis.",
               "A representative algorithm of HC is the Shrink algorithm . Shrink is an unsupervised clustering algorithm. It takes advantage of the integration of the modularity optimization approaches and the density-based clustering. The remarkable merits of the Shrink algorithm are that it can detect not only clusters, but also the structure of the network, i.e., the hubs and the outliers. Another HC algorithm is a community partition method based on node similarity proposed by Ying el al. . In the algorithm, each node is initialized as a community in the network at the beginning. Then, communities are merged iteratively based on neighbourhood similarity. Ying et al's approach has lower computational complexity and has been applied for many types of networks, indicating that this algorithm is effective and efficient for community detection.",
               "Based on reviews above, the limitations of the existing approaches have been summarized. First of all, some classic diffusion models, i.e., IC Model and LT Model only consider TC, which result in that influence maximization is treated as a simplified probabilistic problem. In addition, the influence probabilities are predefined and static. Secondly, user preference plays a critical part in influence maximization, since users with common preferences can easier influence each other. However, this factor was not taken into consideration in most of the existing approaches.",
