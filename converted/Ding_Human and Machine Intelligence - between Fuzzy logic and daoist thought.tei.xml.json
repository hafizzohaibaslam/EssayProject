               "Mathematical models are built for human dealing with the real world. However, the subtle behavior of the natural world (as we perceive it) cannot be modelled by rigid axioms. Most human concepts lack a rigorous definition for its vagueness and imprecision as well as its changing meaning reflecting evolving nature and human societies, the more rigorous the model, the less similar to reality. The great achievement of the theory of fuzziness is to have succeeded to build models for entities that lack a rigorous definition.",
               "The famous Turing Test remains a dream of artificial intelligence until today. Human intelligence has been taken as the gold standard of machine intelligence, but such gold standard also lacks a rigorous definition. We apprehend the inner and the outer world by vague feelings, which become progressively more precise. \"the machinery of fuzzy logic is needed for mechanization of human reasoning. In this perspective, fuzzy logic is of direct relevance to achievement of human level machine intelligence.\" (Zadeh) To further emphasize why and how we can expect that fuzzy logic plays the role of a bridge from natural to machine intelligence, Professor Zadeh has put forward the following words:",
               "\"Science deals not with reality but with models of reality. In large measure, scientific progress is driven by a quest for better models of reality. In the real world, imprecision, uncertainty and complexity have a pervasive presence. In this setting, construction of better models of reality requires a better understanding of how to deal effectively with imprecision, uncertainty and complexity. To a significant degree, development of fuzzy logic has been, and continues to be, motivated by this need.\" (Zadeh) What can be read out from the words above are guiding ideas and thought that are significant both technically and philosophically. From technical perspective, the development of a good model of reality needs to take into account imprecision, uncertainty and complexity. From philosophical perspective, humans deal with reality not directly but through models that are only approximation of the real world, and the better we handle imprecision, uncertainty and complexity, the better the model we may be able to build.",

               "\"A concept which has a position of centrality in fuzzy logic is that of a fuzzy set. Informally, a fuzzy set is a class with a fuzzy boundary, implying a gradual transition from membership to nonmembership. A fuzzy set is precisiated through graduation, that is, through association with a scale of grades of membership. Thus, membership in a fuzzy set is a matter of degree. Importantly, in fuzzy logic everything is or is allowed to be graduated, that is, be a matter of degree. Furthermore, in fuzzy logic everything is or is allowed to be granulated, with a granule being a clump of attribute-values drawn together by indistinguishability, equivalence, similarity, proximity or functionality. Graduation and granulation form the core of fuzzy logic.\" (Zadeh) The concept of \"graded membership\" applies to a class that lacks a rigorous definition. Such concept is often confused with the concept of probability, which is caused by an underlying random process or by lack of information. A situation of lack of information may be improved when more information and data become available, especially with the growth of big data and information technologies. The lack of definition, however, relates to a more fundamental limitation in human's cognitive ability.",
               "Although imprecision is a phenomena rooted at the limitation in human's cognitive ability, the idea of fuzziness is not universally accepted even today. To this situation, Professor Zadeh says, \"there are many misconceptions and misunderstandings regarding fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic. To some, I was advocating an abandonment of the deep-seated tradition of striving for rigor and precision.\" 1 While most scientists are used to consider that accuracy and certainty are essential principle for exploring true nature of the world, Daoist 2 thinkers believe that the ultimate source and true nature of the universe is uncertain and obscure.",
               "As many philosophical and religious traditions, Daoism has its reflection and doctrine about the source and ground of the universe, which is not so certain and acknowledgeable. One significant piece on this theme, which is found in the Laozi , is not providing merely theory about the beginning of our world and myriad things in the universe, but also the foundation of all other Daoist teachings and characters. The unique speculation and reflection about the possible entity and state, from which the universe comes, is a key for understanding the general attributes and uniqueness of Daoist philosophy. There are noticeable points of Daoist thought, and one comes of the most significant points is concerning the true nature of the universe.",

In the Laozi, all sentences related to the ultimate reason and truth share the same style. Thus Daoist statements about the true nature of the universe are always hesitating; at least they seem to reflect nonperfect confidence. Thus, the Laozi further states:",

Zadeh has distributed the same message repeatedly, the quotation here is from his message distributed to BISC online discussion group on Oct 2013. The word Daoism suggests complicated thought system (or Daoist philosophy) and Daoist religious movements. In this essay, the Daoist theories are mainly based on the first Daoist text Daodejing (Tao-te-ching) or the Laozi (Lao-tzu). This has nothing to do with Daoist religious teachings. The quotations from the Laozi are based on Liu's complication and adaptation from various versions and translations, unless specific citations provided otherwise. and ground of the universe. It has no proper name. If being forced to give it a name, he will call it Great. Obviously, great, similar to good, bad, big, small, etc., cannot be used as a proper name. What the author repeatedly emphasizes is that no one knows exactly the foundation and true nature of the world, though the author does believe there is something functioning as the ultimate source and ground of all beings in the world.",
               "This makes Daoism different from many religious and philosophical doctrines. The Bible describes clearly and precisely the processing of God's creation of the universe; Plato's theory sees it specifically and systematically as the relation between the transcendent kingdom of perfect ideas and the empirical world of imperfect myriad things. Even in other Chinese or oriental religious and philosophical schools, we find such differences from Daoism. Buddhism confidently disserts that the truth of world is essentially empty, all existence we can see and feel are just delusion and untrue; Confucian thinkers strongly believe that the moral doctrine tian-li (heavenly principle) is the ultimate truth of the world.",

A fuzzy set is precisiated through graduation ( In our everyday life, good and bad are often treated as two opposite concepts. However, when the two are applied to make evaluation with the same criteria, they both appear to be fuzzy sets with unsharpened boundary and possible overlap in between. The same spirit applies to many pairs of concepts that are usually considered opposite, such as long and short, big and small, high and low, fast and slow, etc. The distinguishing factors between these paired concepts are only relative. Some well accepted and widely adopted schemes in our life, such as \"passing\" or \"failure\" of school examination, are a binary precisiation of \"good-bad\" defined as crisp sets on numerical scores.

The significance of the theory of precisiation may be understood from two aspects: a technical aspect, and a philosophical aspect. From the technical aspect, with the utilization of fuzzy sets, fuzzy truths, fuzzy numbers, type-2 or higher order fuzziness, it allows but not ignores or rejects undifferentiation; it provides a spectrum between true and false, know and don't-know, to more naturally reflect the human knowledge imperfection; it offers tools for describing highly complex situation with mixed types of imperfection involved.",

All descriptions of Dao seem to suggest non-being (wu), in the sense that human beings cannot grasp it because it is not any concrete thing humans can perfectly capture. The Laozi, in Chap. 14, describes it this way: \"It cannot be given any name\" or it cannot be nameable implies the impossibility for human beings to cognize Dao, because it is transcendent and out of our approach. Similar ideas are presented in the Laozi Chap. 25, which reveals the Daoist conception of the source and ground of the universe. Here it reads:",

One of the key features found in fuzzy decision is that the decision maker is not forced to give a precise formulation, merely for the sake of mathematical reasons. A fuzzy decision is made with a compromise of the satisfaction of multiple constraints and objectives that are described with fuzziness.

Literally, it sounds like no action at all, but actually, it implies a special way of action, a negation of regular ways, for transcendent and better results. That is summed as a famous saying: \"To do nothing yet leave nothing undone.\" This way is different or opposite from common ways to deal with governance, as well as general affairs.",

Without requiring forced precision in modeling fuzzy decision making, one will be able to keep more information (with imprecision and vagueness) from reality and bring that to final decision; and will also be able to minimize the extra inaccuracy introduced through forced precision in early stages. In other words, no forced action for precision leads to more accuracy to reality. At this point, we find another consistency between the spirits of fuzzy logic and Daoism in their deep roots.",

One extreme is restraint, manipulation, interruption, interference, exploitation, control, and oppression; the other is pampering, spoiling, indulgence, permissiveness, and over-protection. Thus, fu or assistance is the careful and prudent art of sagely leadership; its purpose and objective are completely aimed at benefiting the myriad things, no aspect of which shows off the sage's own importance and intelligence or accrues personal benefits. This fu or assistance is a typical example of nonaction for better results from unusual actions.",

Zadeh, the founding father of fuzzy logic, has selflessly provided his support, and assistance to thousands of scientists and researchers by guiding new directions, encouraging discussions, and listening to comments and even disagreements. Without his guidance and continuous efforts in establishing a friendly, an encouraging, and a harmony environment in the fuzzy logic community, the achievement of fuzzy logic research would never be the same. The success of fuzzy logic witnesses how the spirit of fu helps our development in science and technology.",

Among them there are two that stand out in importance. First, the capability to converse, communicate, reason and make rational decisions in an environment of imprecision, uncertainty, incompleteness of information, partiality of truth and partiality of possibility.\" (Zadeh) . In spite of the limited cognitive ability in describing the real world with imprecision, uncertainty, and partial truth, humans are able to approximate the reality for their problem solving with amazingly simplified models, through observation and intuition, as well as rational analyses. One important evidence is that a fuzzy rule-based system in general uses a far less number of rules compared to a typical rule-based expert system for the same application, through appropriate fuzzy granulation. Computing with words opens the door for further exploring potential utilization of human wisdom toward the development of human level machine intelligence."
