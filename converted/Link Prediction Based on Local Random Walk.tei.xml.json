               "Ff-Computer science and technology PACS 89.75.Hc-Networks and genealogical trees PACS 89.65.-s-Social and economic systems Abstract.-The problem of missing link prediction in complex networks has attracted much attention recently. Two difficulties in link prediction are the sparsity and huge size of the target networks. Therefore, the design of an efficient and effective method is of both theoretical interests and practical significance. In this Letter, we proposed a method based on local random walk, which can give competitively good prediction or even better prediction than other random-walk-based methods while has a lower computational complexity."

               "n(x, y) = E(l xy denotes the corresponding entry in L + . Assume that two nodes are considered to be more similar if they have a smaller average commute time, then the similarity between the nodes x and y can be defined as the reciprocal of n(x, y), namely (v) RWR: This index is a direct application of the PageRank algorithm . Considering a random walker starting from node x, who will iteratively move to a random neighbour with probability c and return to node x with probability 1 ? c, and denoting by q xy the probability this walker locates at node y in the steady state, then we have Accordingly, the RWR index is defined as",
               "(vi) HSM: The hierarchical structure of a network can be represented by a dendrogram with N leaves and N ? 1 internal nodes. Each internal node r is associated with a probability p r and the connecting probability of a pair of nodes is equal to p m where m is the lowest common ancestor of these two nodes. To predict missing links with this method we first sample a large number of dendrograms with probability proportional to their likelihood. And then calculate the mean connecting probability ij by averaging the corresponding probability p ij over all sampled dendrograms. A higher ij indicates a higher probability that nodes i and j are connected .",
               "The results of these eight methods on five real networks are shown in . For each network, the training set contains 90% of the known links. Generally speaking, the global indices perform better than the local ones. And our proposed indices, LRW and SRW, can give overall better predictions than the other methods for both AUC and precision. Compared with LRW index, the SRW index can lead to an even higher accuracy. The dependence of accuracy on the proportion of training set, labeled by p, in USAir network and C.elegans network 3 is shown in . The results indicate that the advantage of LRW index and SRW index are not sensitive to the density of the network.",
               "Interestingly, when predicting with the LRW index, as shown in , we find a positive correlation between the optimal step and the average shortest distance. For example, of USAir and C.elegans are very small, no more than 3, their optimal steps are also small, 2 and 3 respectively in the case of p = 0.9. However, in the power grid with16, its AUC keeps increasing at the beginning and reaches a near optimum at step 16, where one more step leads to only 0.2% improvement. We also find that with the decreasing of p, the optimal step increases. This is because the removal of links to the probe set will increase as shown in the insets of .",
               "Besides high accuracy, the low computation complexity is another important concern in the design of prediction algorithm. Generally speaking, the global indices have a higher complexity than the local indices. As we known, the time complexity in calculating the inverse or pseudoinverse of an NN matrix is O(N 3 ), while the time complexity of n-step LRW (or SRW) is approximately O(N n ). Science in most networks is much smaller than N , LRW and SRW run much faster than ACT and RWR. This advantage is prominent especially in the hugesize (i.e. large N ) and sparse (i.e. small networks. For example, LRW for power grid is thousands of times faster than ACT, even when n = 10. In HSM, the process to sample a dendrogram asks for O(N 2 ) steps of the Markov chain , and in the worse case, it takes exponential time . Each step consumes a certain time to do some random selections. In addition, to predict the missing links, a large number of dendrograms are acquired. In this paper, we sample 5000 dendrograms for each implementation. Therefore, the time complexity of HSM is relatively high. It can handle networks with up to a few thousand nodes in a reasonable time, while LRW and SRW are able to handle such networks containing tens of thousands of nodes. Note that, although ACT, RWR and HSM have a higher time complexity, they provide much more information beyond link prediction. For example, the HSM algorithm can be used to uncover the hierarchical organization of real networks.",
               "Conclusion. -In this Letter, we proposed two similarity indices for link prediction based on local random walk, the Local Random Walk (LRW) index and the Superposed Random Walk (SRW) index. We compared our methods with six well-known methods on five real networks. The results show that our methods can give remarkably better prediction than the three local similarity indices. When comparing with the three global methods, LRW and SRW can give slightly better prediction with a lower computational complexity."
