               "Influence maximization, defined by Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos (2003), is the problem of finding a small set of seed nodes in a social network that maximizes the spread of influence under certain influence cascade models. In this paper, we propose an extension to the independent cascade model that incorporates the emergence and propagation of negative opinions. The new model has an explicit parameter called quality factor to model the natural behavior of people turning negative to a product due to product defects. Our model incorporates negativity bias (negative opinions usually dominate over positive opinions) commonly acknowledged in the social psychology literature. The model maintains some nice properties such as submodularity, which allows a greedy approximation algorithm for maximizing positive influence within a ratio of 1 ? 1/e. We define a quality sensitivity ratio (qs-ratio) of influence graphs and show a tight bound of ��(n/k) on the qs-ratio, where n is the number of nodes in the network and k is the number of seeds selected, which indicates that seed selection is sensitive to the quality factor for general graphs. We design an efficient algorithm to compute influence in tree structures, which is nontrivial due to the negativity bias in the model. We use this algorithm as the core to build a heuristic algorithm for influence maximiza-tion for general graphs. Through simulations, we show that our heuristic algorithm has matching influence with a standard greedy approximation algorithm while being orders of magnitude faster."

Let U be the set of incoming neighbors of v that are at distance i ? 1 from S. Clearly, all nodes U are activated at time i ? 1 because of the assumption p(e) = 1, and v will be activated at time i. In our model, v will be activated by one of the nodes in U which is chosen at random. By induction, every node in U is positive with probability q i .

The moral of the lemma is that when the graph contains two different kind of structures, where one structure has fast neighborhood growth initially but small overall reach and the other structure has slow neighborhood growth but large overall reach, the optimal choice of the seed set may critically depend on the product's quality. With high quality factor, we prefer to choose structures with a large reachable set, but with a low quality factor, we prefer to choose structures that have large immediate neighborhood, since when influence are propagated in multiple hops, it is likely that someone in the chain will dislike the product if the quality factor is low.

However, once negative opinions may emerge in the network (q < 1), the situation changes significantly for computing pap(u). Suppose now that some of u's in-neighbors are positive and some are negative. Because of the negativity bias in the IC-N model, in particular negative neighbors will only make u negative while positive neighbors may make u positive or negative, the influence result on u depends on the order of the activation attempts of u's neighbors. This order is affected by two factors: (a) the time steps at which neighbors of u are activated, and (b) the random permutation among the neighbors who are activated at the same time step.

For ease of reading, the legend of each figure lists the algorithms in the same order as their corresponding influence spread with 50 seeds.

This is consistent with previous reported results, and we omit reporting results of random seed selection for other datasets. On the other hand, (a) shows that in all  Scalability of MIA-N. We further test the scalability of MIA-N algorithm by using a family of synthetic power-law graphs generated by the DIGG package . We generate graphs with doubling number of nodes, from 2K, 4K, up to 256K, using power-law exponent of 2.16. Each size has 10 different random graphs and our running time result is the average among the runs on these 10 graphs. We run both the greedy algorithm and MIA-N to select 50 seeds for each graph. The result in (b) clearly shows that our MIA-N scales almost linearly with the size of the graph, and scales much better than the greedy algorithm (e.g. MIA-N only takes 11 minutes to finish in a graph of 256K nodes and 353K edges while the greedy algorithm takes more than 2 hours to finish a graph four times smaller). The greedy algorithm has a much steeper curve mainly because it requires a large number of simulations to estimate influence spread accurately. Reducing the number of simulations in the greedy algorithm will significantly reduce its accuracy, as already reported in similar earlier work , and we omit the report here. Quality sensitivity. We would like to study the quality sensitivity of the tested networks. However, the qs-ratio is difficult to obtain directly. To circumvent this problem, we conduct two tests. In the first test, we set all edge propagation probabilities to 1, so that we can use the result in Lemma 2.1 to efficiently obtain influence spread, and then derive the qsratios. shows the result of qs-ratios when selecting one seed from the networks, with the range of quality factors from 0.5 to 1. For NetHEPT, we tried the undirected graph version as well as the directed graph version, where the edge direction is randomly assigned. The q * value in the table indicates at which quality factor the qsr(q) value to its left is achieved. For example, the first row for WikiVote means that, if we use the optimal seed u selected when q = 1, the worst case occurs when the actual quality factor is q * = 0.5, in which case the optimal influence spread is 1.338 times better than the influence spread achieved by u. The results show that in general the qs-ratio is small. Therefore, when the propagation probabilities are smaller and when selecting more seeds, we could expect that the qs-ratio may be even smaller.",
               "Next, we use the MIA-N algorithm to select a seed set with one quality factor q and then compare the influence spread of this seed set at another quality factor q with the seed set selected by MIA-N under q directly. Our results show that except for some rare cases where these influence spread results differ slightly, most results are the same. This suggest that the influence graphs we tested seem not sensitive to different quality factors.",
               "However, this does not mean that MIA-N is not useful. On the contrary, without MIA-N, we cannot efficiently check if a large influence graph is sensitive to the quality factor. Since obtaining qs-ratio directly seems to be intractable, we propose that MIA-N is an efficient tool to check the quality sensitivity of a given influence graph. If the result from MIA-N indicates that the graph is not quality sensitive, then we do not need to obtain the quality factor of the product; otherwise we do need to obtain a good estimate of the quality factor and use MIA-N with the quality factor estimate to achieve a better influence maximization result."

We could further extend it so that node v has probability q v , which may vary from node to node. This is intended to model the situation where different individuals have different tendency of turning negative to a product. However, the extension introduces too many parameters to the model and making it much less tractable for analysis and computation. For example, the influence spread set function may no longer be monotone and submodular. To see this, we can consider the extreme case where some node v has q v = 0 and other nodes have positive quality factors. Since v's influence is always negative, it is quite easy to construct examples where the positive influence set function is neither monotone nor submodular, due to the possible addition of v into the seed set. In fact, we can go even further and show that as long as there are two different quality factors used by the nodes, and even if only one node uses a different quality factor from others, it is enough to construct examples that are not monotone or submodular, as formally stated below(S 1 )). Therefore, we have(S n1 ) < 0, so long as n 1 is sufficiently large, which is a contradiction.",

Companies could use the quality factor q and its associated IC-N model to analyze and predict potential influence and select seeds for influence maximization. Therefore, we feel that using a single quality factor already provides substantial benefits for influence maximization, while introducing individualized q v parameters is less significant and tractable.

Without monotonicity and submodularity, it is unclear how to tackle the influence maximization problem. One possibility is to ignore the stronger negative propagation probabilities, and use the algorithms proposed in this paper to find seeds, hoping that it will not be too far off from the real optimal solution. By investigating into the graphs used in the proof of Theorem 7.2, we see that ignoring stronger negative propagation probabilities may lead to very poor seed choices far from the optimal.

We use seeds selected by our greedy algorithm for= 1, and run simulations to check the positive influence spread whenis greater than 1. Surprisingly, our simulation results, shown in , indicates that the positive influence spread has almost no change whenincreases, and only negative influnece spread increases. The result suggests that, even though negative influence spreads wider, it does not intercept the spread of positive influence in such real graphs. The reason is likely to be the combined effects of the sparsity of the graphs, the small number of seeds selected, and the exponential decay in likelihood of influence propagation along any path. It would be interesting to further investigate under what conditions the positive influence spread is not significantly affected by stronger negative influence propagations. bility distribution such as the exponential distribution, which is already incorporated into a competitive influence cascade model in . We note that without negative opinions, this extension is unnecessary, because as long as node u activates its out-neighbor v, it does not matter how long this activation takes.

               "By fixing both edge selections and edge delays first, the authors of show that the influence spread of one product in a competitive environment is still monotone and submodular. This argument, however, does not apply to our case of negative opinions. A key observation is that a node u may have a very short delay path to a node v but the path has many hops. Thus when adding u into the seed set, u will be the one reaching v the fastest, but since the path traverses many nodes, v only has a very small chance to be positive. Hence, after adding edge delays, the influence spread may no longer be monotone and submodular. Therefore, although adding edge delays would make the model more realistic, it also adds more parameters to the model and makes the model less tractable.",

               "Let us mimic the proof for Lemma 2.1 though here we have more cases to analyze. Again, let us defineG (S, q) to be the net influence spread when the seed set is S and the quality factor is q, i.e., the expected difference between the number of positively activated nodes and the number of negatively activated nodes. Also, let vV and pap G (v, S, q) be the expected difference between the probability v become positively activated and the probability that v become negatively activated.",
               "When a node v is reachable from the seed set S, we have pap G (v, S, q) = 2q d G (S,v)+1 ? 1. Otherwise, we have pap G (v, S, q) = 0. We shall show that pap G (v, S, q) is a monotone and submodular function when v and q are fixed.",
               "First, it is clear that pap G (v, ?, q) = 0 in this setting. To show that pap G (S, q) is both submodular and monotone when q2 ?1/(?+1) . For smaller q values, adding new seed nodes may cause negative net influence spread, and thus the net influence spread is not monotone or submodular.",
               "Another possible objective is to maximize the ratio between positive influence spread and negative influence, which is very similar to the net-promotor score proposed in . However, this would also suffer as the net influence spread objective causing the object function not monotone or submodular. Therefore, while it is interesting to study net influence maximization or similar objectives that incorporate negative influence spread, except for q values close to 1, it may requires new techniques and is left open as a future research direction.",
               "In summary, all of the above extensions and their implications could be interesting for future research. We hope that our study could motivate more work on the algorithmic aspects of social influence propagations that include both positive and negative opinions. G (v,, q) is monotone, let us consider two subsets S ? T ? V . In case the node v is reachable from S, we have 2q",
               "The last inequality holds because of the assumption q2 ?1/(?+1) . In case the node v is not reachable from S but reachable from T , we have pap"
