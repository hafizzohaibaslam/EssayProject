               "In past twenty years, the multi-agent technology has been widely employed for the development of web-based systems. Currently, agent-based service-oriented applications have been widely applied in many complex domains such as web-based e-markets, web-based grid computing, e-government and service-oriented software systems, cross Internet and organizations. In this kind of service-oriented systems, service provider (agents) and service consumer (agents) are autonomous entities and can enter and leave the environment freely. How to select the most suitable service providers according to the requested services from consumers in such an open environment is a very challenge issue. In this paper, we propose an innovated trust model-the GTrust model for group services selection in a general service-oriented environment. In our model, the trust evaluation for a group service is based on (1) the coverage rate of the requested functionalities from a group service, (2) the dependency relationships among individual services in a group, (3) reference reports from third parties for each provider of individual services in a group and (4) the similarity measurement about to what extent the reference reports can reflect the new service request in terms of priority distributions on attributes of the service. The experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the GTrust model in terms of satisfaction degree in group service selections."

               "Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have attracted a lot of attention from researchers in computer science, information technology, engineering, as well as other disciplines due to their abilities of autonomous decision making, collaborative problem solving, learning and adaptation abilities under open and distributed environments. In past decade, agent and multi-agent technologies have been widely employed for developing web-based service-oriented systems such as Internetbased grid systems , e-market , as well as pervasive computing systems.",
               "The web-based service-oriented environment is an open environment where most service consumer (agents) and service provider (agents) have only local views about their partners and the environment and can also join and leave the environment freely at any time. In such a dynamic environment, how to select a trustworthy service provider to fulfill a requested service from a consumer is a very challenging problem for most service-oriented applications.",
               "'Agent Trust' is one of important research issues and many researchers in MASs had made significant effects on trust and reputations models such as probabilistic theory-based models , the certified reputation model and evidential trust models . In past decade, some trust models have been developed in service-oriented domains to help consumers evaluate the trust values of potential service providers based on different considerations. In 2000, Zacharia et. al. proposed a reputation-based trust evaluation model based on the historical performance of a provider, called the SPORAS , for service provider selection. In 2006, Huynh et. al. introduced a famous trust model, called the Certified Reputation (CR), to evaluate provider's trust through the third party references . In 2010, Su et. al. did further work based on the CR model and developed a priority-based trust model to evaluate a trust value of a potential service provider based on the third party references, its historical performance and the priority distribution on the attributes of the requested service . The most current models evaluate the trust values for individual providers. However, in recent years, many complex service requests requests from consumers cannot be handled by a single service and a group of services from different providers are needed to satisfy these service requests. Therefore, trust models focusing on the trust evaluations for single service providers cannot be directly used for the group trust evaluation and how to choose a group of services for a consumer has become a new challenge issue.",
               "The trust evaluation for a group of service providers is different from that of for a single service provider, because there are more factors may affect the trust values of group services. The main factors include (1) the coverage rate of the requested functionalities from a service group, which determines whether the service group can satisfy all of the attribute of a service requested by a consumer, (2) the relationships among individual services in a group, (3) the performance of the individual services and reputations of individual providers in a service group, and (4) the suitability measure for the group fitting the new service based on the priority distribution on service attributes requested from a consumer.",
               "The GTrust model has the following merits: (1) we use the 'functionality coverage' value to represent the functionalities which a potential service group can provide corresponding to the request from the consumer; (2) we introduce the concept of the 'dependency degree' to represent relationships among services in a service group; (3) we use the concept of the 'third party reference' from the PBTrust model to represent the performance of individual services in the same group; and (4) we use the concept of 'similarity' to measure the similarity in terms of priority distributions on attributes between historical services of group members and requested services.",
               "The rest of paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is the problem description. The basic components of the GTrust model is briefly introduced in Section 3. The detail descriptions of each components in the GTrust are introduced in detail Section 4. Finally, the paper is concluded and future work is outlined in Section 5."

We can see that there are no dependency relationships among S1 to S4 but 4 dependency relationships exist between S5 with other 4 services. In another word, S5 depends on S1, S2, S3 and S4, respectively. In order to identify relationships among services in a group, we define the dependency degree as follows. "
