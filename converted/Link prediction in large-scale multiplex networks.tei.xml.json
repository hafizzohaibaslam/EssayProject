               "Complex networks are highly heterogeneous in nature and can be struc-tured into multiplex layers, each having same nodes but different types of links. Link prediction is one of the important tasks in the analysis of complex networks. It has a wide range of application: recommender systems, protein-protein interactions , identification of criminal links, and prediction of scientific and commercial collaborations to name a few. In this paper we provide a formal definition of link prediction. We give a brief account of various existing link prediction approaches, focusing mainly on dyadic topological approaches. We present two new approaches of link prediction. Both tackle the problem of predicting future collaborations between authors in a co-authorship network. The first approach is based on supervised rank aggregation where we use a rank based model to learn weights for different topological predictors. In this approach we use an existing rank aggregation method and our newly proposed method of weighted rank aggregation, to find the new links. The second approach works in a multiplex scenario, where we propose to use some new attributes to capture multiplex information available in different network layers (each having different type of links within the same nodes), to enhance the performance of prediction of future collaboration between authors. We experiment on DBLP datasets and preliminary results validate our approaches."

Complex netLaboratoire d'Informatique de Paris Nord (LIPN), Universite Sorbonne Paris Cite e-mail: firstname.lastname@lipn.univ-paris13.fr work can be any real world network which have an abstract form without any predefined structure or pattern of evolution. At times, they can be highly dynamical in nature, evolving or changing constantly. Also, starting with a tiny form, in this era of big data, they take the form of huge networks. Analyzing these dynamic largescale networks is a major challenge for social network researchers. These networks are often heterogeneous in nature. That means a real network may have different types of nodes and also different types of links. Multiplex networks are a category of heterogeneous complex networks, which essentially have different kinds of links between same nodes. They can be represented as a set of simple networks, each having the same nodes but different sets of links. A common example of multiplex network is a scientific collaboration networks. Researchers or authors of research papers are an important part of these networks. They can be linked if they have co-published some articles or if they have published their articles in the same conferences or the domain of their research are the same. They can also be linked if they have referred to same works in their articles. shows a diagrammatic representation of a scientific collaboration network and multiplex structures present within them. In (b), it is shown how a authors network can be represented by multiplex layers, each having same nodes but different types of links or edges.",
               "One of the most important problems in the analysis of complex networks, is the problem of link prediction . It consists in estimating the likelihood of existence or appearance of an edge between two unlinked nodes, based on observed links and attributes that contain information about the nodes, edges or the entire graph. It has important applications in many fields including social, biological and information systems etc. Link prediction has been widely used in biological networks like protein interaction network [ABF + 06, ET12], metabolic networks, food web etc. to find missing links and thereby helps in reducing the experimental cost if the predictions are accurate. In social interaction and scientific or commercial collaboration networks they can play an important role to predict new associations (new links) . This further has utility in the recommendation task: a service provided by almost all social networks and majorly used in e-commerce networks . Link prediction can also be helpful in finding hidden criminal links which is another critical field of research.",

Structural link prediction have obvious utility for finding missing or hidden information in a network. It has direct application to find unobserved patterns of genes, protein and yeast interactions for the medical studies on various diseases like cancer, HIV, Alzheimer etc.",

So here we have information about the network till time t and the goal will be to predict a new link that may appear at some point of time in future say t + k. It has its application primarily in recommendation systems that are being used widely in e-commerce websites for product recommendations, in any search engines to help users with probably relevant terms they might be searching, for recommendation of tags in social resources sharing websites like Flickr 1 , YouTube 2 , De.li.ci.ous 3 etc. and very commonly used for recommendation of friends in many social networks like Facebook and Twitter . It has another significant use in predicting future collaborations between researchers for academic or scientific purposes. It also has an important use in order to identify probably upcoming criminal associations.",
               "The problem have been keenly studied by many researchers over a long period of time. Many link prediction approaches has been proposed in recent years. They can be classified as node-features based approaches or topological approaches based on whether they use node-features or only structural information of the graph for prediction. In node-features based approaches, apart from the structure of graph we also have some extra information regarding the properties or characteristics of nodes. These extra information can be helpful in predicting links when the nodes are very sparsely connected in the graph. One such approach is local probabilistic model proposed by C. . Topological approaches refer to those which involve only exploitation of graph structure of the network. They compute scores for pairs of unconnected nodes based on only the graphical features of the network structure and without any extra information about the features of nodes. They observe mainly how the connections have been established between nodes and how they change over time. Based on former they try to predict a missing link or based on the later they predict a new link. Node features are very useful when the network graph is very sparsely connected and not much can be learned from graph topology. Whereas topological approaches are very efficient in the absence of content of feature information. Both have their own utility and at times a combination of both can come out to give a very good predictor. These kind of approaches can be termed as hybrid approaches.",
               "The topological (graph based) link prediction approaches can be further categorized as temporal or non-temporal / static based on the fact that whether they take into consideration the dynamic aspect of the network or not. Another way to classify them is as dyadic or structural approaches, based on the type of score calculation involved. The approaches using link score are dyadic approaches where as those looking for mining rules of evolution of sub-graphs can be considered as structural approaches. They can also be classified as supervised or unsupervised. Supervised approaches generate a model using many topological scores for unlinked node pairs to predict links where as unsupervised approaches use a single type of score for the node pairs and mostly use ranking to predict new links.",

In topology based link prediction approaches, only the structural properties of the underlying graph are used to implement statistical relational learning and to find a model that will be used to predict links. Suppose we have a social network graph G =< V, E > where V is the set of nodes or vertices and E is the set of edges present in the graph. So the goal of link prediction is to find (u, v) pairs such that u, vV and (u, v) /E. For prediction of new links at a certain point of time t n+1 having network information till time t n , the network will be presented as a sequence of graphs representing different snapshots of the network at different points of time < t 0 , t 1 , ..., t n >. Suppose the temporal sequence of graphs is G =< G 0 , G 1 , ..., G n >, so the goal of link prediction here will be to find the structure of graph G n+1 . In other words, here we try to find (u, v) pairs such that u, vV and (u, v) /E where V = n i=0 V i and E = n i=0 E i . In any network G,(v) is the set of neighbours of node v and degree of a node is given by",
               "In machine learning terms, the unlinked pairs of nodes are called examples or instances. If the time aspect of the network are to be considered also, then the examples can be generated as follows. Let G =< G 1 , . . . , G n > be a temporal sequence of an evolving graphs. The whole sequence is divided into two parts: training and testing. Each part is then again divided into two phases one for generation of examples and another for labeling those examples. Thus, for example, in training we shall have a learning and labeling phases resulting in graphs namely G learn and G label generated by making union of the temporal sequences of the graphs for three corresponding time slots. The training data is constructed as follows. An example will be a couple of nodes (x, y) that are not linked in G learn but both belonging to the same connected component. The class is obtained by checking whether the couple of nodes is indeed connected in G label . If such a connection exists then it will be a positive example in the supervised learning task and if no connection exists, it will be a negative example . Thus, examples are generated from these graphs for both training and testing. These examples are also characterized by a given number of topological attributes computed on learning (or test) graphs. and 3 illustrate the process diagrammatically. "

Rank aggregation can be defined as a process of combining a number of ranked lists or rankings of candidates or elements to get a single list and with least possible disagreement with all the experts or voters who provide these lists. These methods were a part of social choice theory and were mostly applied to political and election related problems [BOR81, BNM + 98, YL78]. These techniques were designed to ensure fairness among experts while combining their rankings and hence all experts are given equal weights. Expressing the link prediction problem in terms of a vote is straightforward: candidates are examples (pairs of unconnected nodes), while voters are topological measures computed for these pairs of unlinked nodes. Then we have a voting problem with quite huge set of candidates and rather a reduced set of voters.

One of the well known work is weighted majority algorithm proposed in where the authors have proposed to use weights for predictors, all having equal weights in the beginning. There is a master predictor which makes the final prediction based on the class which corresponds to a maximum total weights of predictors. If the final prediction is wrong then weights of all predictors who disagreed with that label, is increased by a factorsuch that 0< 1 and thus reducing the effect of unworthy predictors at each iteration. This approach has a limitation that the performance of the master predictor can be at most equal to the best performing predictor. On the contrary, the use of rank aggregation can provide even better prediction at times. This may be due the fact that, in these algorithms, the \"likes\" of majority of the predictors is given higher preference. At the same time, the \"dislikes\" are given least preference. So these algorithms are much more spam/noise resistant.",

Still, the fact remains that rank aggregation methods especially Kemeny method has a high computational complexity which questions its applicability for link prediction in large scale networks.

We propose a new approach for exploring the multiplex relations to predict future collaboration (co-authorship links) among authors. The applied approach is supervised machine learning based, where we attempt to learn a model for link formation based on a set of topological attributes describing both positive and negative examples. While such an approach has been successfully applied in the context on simple networks, different options can be used to extend it to the multiplex network context. One option is to compute topological attributes in each layer of the multiplex. Another one is to compute directly new multiplex-based attributes quantifying the multiplex nature of dyads (potential links). Both approaches will be discussed in the next section."

In the end all these attributes can be combined in various ways to form different sets of vectors of attribute values characterizing each example or unconnected node pair.

We present here a brief state of art of various link prediction approaches focusing mainly on dyadic topological approaches. The unsupervised methods involve computation of scores for unlinked pairs of nodes. While neighborhood based scores are easy to compute, some path based measures like Katz, commute time, rooted pagerank can be really time consuming. Same is the case of other matrix based approaches which have issues of computation time and memory when applied on real large scale networks. This makes them difficult to be employed for evolving real networks. So some approximate solutions for these measures such as truncated Katz and more can be a good choice.",

Same is done in our proposed approach based on supervised rank aggregation. While machine learning methods have been in use since a long time and have given reliable performances in various contexts, supervised rank aggregation method is quite new and requires much work to establish its applicability in real applications. Also the fact remains that as they involve use of aggregation methods like approximate Kemeny aggregation, they have a computational complexity of O(rn log(n)) where r is the number of attributes used and n is the number of examples in each input ranked list provided. But the preliminary results we get on the DBLP datasets validate the approach and encourage us to explore the method further.",
               "A major challenge faced while using these types of supervised approaches, is the well known extreme class skewness or class imbalance problem. The number of actual new links is very small as compared to the number of possible links. As we can see, in the DBLP datasets we have used, the ratios of positive vs negatives links are 1:113 ,1:248 and 1:282 in the three datasets respectively. Also note that this imbalance increases with the size of graphs used for experimentation. This makes it more difficult for an algorithm to generate a good model and give a good inference on the test data. Although very few of the negative examples have actual predictor value as positive examples, the model ends up giving a large number of raw false positives. Also in presence of large class skew, the information carried by the positive examples gets diluted in the vast negative class. Moreover unlike classical machine learning context, in link prediction, correct classification of positive examples are more important. Most common solution to this problem, as suggested by the existing research, is sampling of negative examples. This can be done by random methods or by using some filters by distance, node degree etc. Another way on which we are working is to use a filter based on community detection algorithm.",
               "The assumption here is that, two nodes that do not belong to the same community, tend to remain unlinked for a longer period than compared to those belonging to the same community. Thus they can have more meaning as negative examples during the learning of model. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, but some some can be fairer than others. The sampling of data is mostly done on the learning data. Sometimes it is required to sample test data like the case when extremely large number of test examples causes unreasonable demands on processing resources and storage. If for any reason this has to be done, proper care should be taken based on the context where link prediction is to be done. More details about class imbalance problem can be found in . In , there is a detailed description about how the predictor performance changes with sampling of test data. They also provide valuable information about which performance measure is to be used for evaluating different link prediction techniques.",
               "Last but not the least, we have presented in the end of this paper, how to extend the traditional supervised machine learning based link prediction approach to pre-dict links in multiplex networks. We propose new attributes that capture multiplex information. By applying them for the prediction of co-authorship links, we show that the use of multiplex attributes improves the prediction result. The same method can be used to predict links in any of the multiplex layers. With the preliminary results, we are really excited and hopeful that the multiplex information can prove to be very useful for different tasks in the analysis of the network."
