We use fuzzy logic to assist users to express their preferences about a product in fuzzy terms such as low, medium and high. Our system evaluates offers based on a fuzzy utility function and feeds utility scores to a fuzzy inference system which then computes its next counter offer. Our paper presents issues involved in the development of a multi-agent system for e-commerce settings using the JADE platform-a modern agent development environment. In this paper our focus is on implementing agents of different types/roles engaged in activities usually encountered with buying and selling in an e-commerce environment. Our concluding remarks and future research are presented."

Recently software agents have been used to solve complex problems in e-commerce . For example, agents have been used successfully to filter information, match people with similar interests, and recommend products and services to customers. In multi-agent systems, software agents cannot directly control other agents because every agent is an independent decision maker. In such situations, negotiation becomes the necessary mechanism to achieve mutual agreement between agents.",
               "In this paper our aim is to implement a fuzzy-based negotiation system and evaluate its strengths and suitability for e-commerce. We use the scenario of purchasing a laptop as an example to illustrate the process. For our scenario we consider multi-issues such as low price, high popularity and medium memory, and use fuzzy logic to support bilateral agent negotiation. The key issues in such autonomous negotiation are bargaining agreement and bargaining strategy. The bargaining agreement is to manage a set of rules that govern the interaction between agents and some of the events that change the state of the negotiation process where as the bargaining strategy represents an agent's expectation and intent during the negotiation process . We argue that bilateral agent negotiation is indeed an interesting and valuable tool to automate some complex e-commerce transactions. We describe our efforts and experience in the development of a fuzzy-based multi-agent system for buying and selling consumer products. The techniques and strategies used in the development of a prototype system are described. Our experimental results are presented and discussed."

Automated bilateral negotiation has been widely investigated both in computational intelligence and in electronic commerce communities . In a multi-agent e-commerce environment, there would be specialised agents which carry out the tasks of parties involved in an e-commerce transaction. There would be a buyer, who is trying to get the best combination of a few different variables (e.g. price, quality, delivery time). The seller would be the bargaining agent who would try to entice the buyer into buying a product at the highest possible revenue. Reaching a mutual agreement in a bargaining situation involves finding an acceptable solution for both the buyer and the seller.",
               "During a bargaining process a buyer inputs his/her requirements about a product in terms of its attribute choices. In such an e-marketplace a buyer agent will help the buyer to find the possible offers and bargain with suitable seller agents by exchanging offers and counter offers. The buyer agent may receive offers from the seller agents representing their product information. The buyer agent will then evaluate these offers based on the buyer's preferences and make a suggestion (counter offer). The buyer agent continues until an agreement can be reached with the seller agent. On the other hand, if the buyer or the seller agent rejects the current incoming offer conditions, the negotiation process will terminate with a 'no deal' state. shows a typical bargain protocol between two agents.

               "If the bargaining process was centred over a single issue (such as the price), then it is relatively straightforward. The buyer will search for the lowest price offered for an item of their choice. Once the lowest price is found, that is the optimal solution to the problem. However, in real world bargaining situations, it is never this simple. There are always multiple issues to consider such as the price, quality, quantity, warranty, delivery date etcetera. In this section we present a multi-issue negotiation model for e-commerce in which agents autonomously negotiate multiissue terms of transactions in a bargaining environment. We use three agents in our model: a buyer agent, a seller agent, and a facilitator agent. The seller agent allows a seller to determine his/her negotiation strategies for selling merchandise. Similarly, the buyer agent allows a buyer to determine his/her negotiation strategies for buying merchandise. The facilitator agent serves to handle the negotiation strategies for both the buyer and the seller agents. In our approach, agents' preferences are expressed in fuzzy terms. The case study for our prototype implementation is buying and selling laptop computers. The negotiation model we have chosen for our study is illustrated in . In this model, issues within both the buyer's request and the seller's offer can be split into hard constraints and soft constraints. Hard constraints are issues that have to be necessarily satisfied in the final agreement, whereas soft constraints represent issues they are willing to negotiate on. The facilitator agent collects information from bargainers and exploits them in order to propose an efficient negotiation outcome.",
               "The negotiation facilitator receives requests and registers the buyers. Once this is done, the negotiation process can begin with the sellers. The negotiation facilitator requests the sellers to provide offers conforming to the restrictions imposed by the buyer agent. Please note that each restriction has an importance rating (0% to 100%), which means there is some leniency in the restrictions imposed by the buyer. For example if the buyer wants the colour Red, but provides an importance rating of 50%, it is quite lenient and the negotiation facilitator will request sellers to make offers for a range of different colours. The negotiation facilitator and sellers go through several rounds of negotiation until they reach the maximum number of rounds. Then the best offer (optimal set) is sent back to the buyer agent. The buyer agent then displays the results of the negotiation process to the end user who is ultimately responsible for making the decision on which item to buy. "

The experimental results show that the proposed intelligent agent raises its counter offer slightly at the beginning of the negotiation and raises more when negotiation is ending. However, by how much an agent raises its counter offer depends on the utility score of the item being negotiated and the current seller's offer. An agent concedes more for an item that has higher utility score (i.e. matches client's preferences better) and concedes less for an item with lower utility score.
