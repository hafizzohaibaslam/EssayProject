In essence, distributed role allocation is the self-classification of each of the agents in a multi-agent system, where the labels are roles.

These coalitions are typically formed by grouping agents with similar characteristics or interests together, either through a centralized mechanism or using distributed computation.

When the agents are embedded in an organizational network structure, skill-constrained sub-group formation is very similar to subgraph discovery in networks. At first the problems appear to be different in that subgroup formation focuses on attributes of the agents, whereas subgraph discovery focuses on local patterns in the network. However, the two problems become closely related when the sub-group formation process in a multi-agent system is restricted by an interaction topology .",
