               "As the World Wide Web in China grows rapidly, mining knowledge in Chinese Web pages becomes more and more important. Mining Web information usually relies on the machine learning techniques which require a large amount of labeled data to train credible models. Although the number of Chinese Web pages increases quite fast, it still lacks Chi-nese labeled data. However, there are relatively sufficient English labeled Web pages. These labeled data, though in different linguistic representations, share a substantial amount of semantic information with Chinese ones, and can be utilized to help classify Chinese Web pages. In this paper , we propose an information bottleneck based approach to address this cross-language classification problem. Our algorithm first translates all the Chinese Web pages to En-glish. Then, all the Web pages, including Chinese and En-glish ones, are encoded through an information bottleneck which can allow only limited information to pass. Therefore, in order to retain as much useful information as possible, the common part between Chinese and English Web pages is inclined to be encoded to the same code (i.e. class label), which makes the cross-language classification accurate. We evaluated our approach using the Web pages collected from Open Directory Project (ODP). The experimental results show that our method significantly improves several existing supervised and semi-supervised classifiers."

Examples of these resources are Reuters-21578 , 20 Newsgroups , and Open Document Project .

Our key observation is that despite the above listed problems, linguistically, the pages in Chinese and English may share the same semantic information, although they are in different representation forms, i.e., Chinese characters and English words, respectively. This is reasonable, because people with good command of both English and Chinese can convey the same information in both languages.

The training and translated target texts are encoded together, allowing all the information to be put through a \"bottleneck\" and represented by a limited number of codewords (i.e. labels in the classification problem). Information bottleneck based approach can maintain most of the common information and disregard the irrelevant information. Thus we can approximate the ideal situation where similar training and translated test pages, which is the common part, are encoded into the same codewords.",

Examples of supervised classification algorithms include decision trees , K nearest neighbor methods , naive Bayes classifiers , support vector machines , and so on.",

In our work, we focus on the second scenario. gave good empirical results on English-Italian cross-language text categorization using an EM-based learning method.

Since traditional supervised classification techniques assume identical distribution for training and test data and in the cross-language setting this assumption is hardly met, most existing algorithms will not cope with the cross-language text classification well. In this work, our method tries to handle the Chinese-English cross-language categorization problem by information bottleneck. We will show that our algorithm can better alleviate the impact of translation error and topic drift, and improve the (English to Chinese) cross-language classification performance against existing methods.

X; X)?I( ? X; Y ) , where Y is the feature set with respect to X. Note that the coding rate I( ? X; X) in classification is no so important as in clustering problems, since classification focuses on prediction accuracy. Therefore, in this task, we need to mainly concentrate on improving the classification accuracy. So that, ?I( ? X; Y ) is optimized instead of I( ? X; X) ?I( ? X; Y ), as the coding rate I( ? X; X) is ignored. Moreover, in order to make the optimization easier, in this work, we optimize I(X; Y ) ? I( ? X; Y ) instead of ?I( ? X; Y ). We will show the optimization details in the next section. Note that, I(X; Y ) is a constant, when X and Y are fixed, and thus optimizing I(X; Y ) ? I( ? X; Y ) is equivalent to optimizing ?I( ? X; Y ). The meaning of objective function I(X; Y ) ? I( ? X; Y ) can be also understood in another way. In classification, the instances are described by the features, and thus there should be mutual information between data instances and their features, i.e. I(X; Y ) > 0. In addition, the category information is also described by the features, and thus I( ? X; Y ) > 0. Therefore, the information in X and?Xand? and?X is contained in forms of I(X; Y ) and I( ? X; Y ). Note that I(X; Y ) is always greater than or equal to I( ? X; Y ), which will be derived in Lemma 1 in Section 5. . Therefore, in the information bottleneck classification setting, the quality of the categorization should be judged by the loss in mutual information between the original instances and categorized instances. The following remark lays our the objective function formally. To summarize, it is noted that cross-language Web pages are carrying a common part of semantic information. According to the information bottleneck theory, this part of information is expected to help encode similar Web pages in different languages since it is highly relevant information to class labels and also is contained in the Web pages in both languages. Therefore, it is clear that the information bottleneck technique is suitable to address the cross-language classification problem."

It is because that during the information theoretic compression, IB tends to encode the similar pages into the same code (label) in that it can reduce the code length without loss of much information.

However, it is noticed that this common approach will bring the error and bias for further classification. Linguistically speaking, machine translation technique is far from satisfactory.

We removed the Regional category because the Web pages in the Regional category are also in other categories. The Web pages in the Adult have not been crawled by our crawler, because most of them are banned by our internet service provider, and thus the Adult category is not included in our data collection. Moreover, the Web pages in the World category are in the languages other than English. We selected all the Chinese pages from the World category as Chinese test data. For Chinese Web pages, there are also 14 top categories each of which can be mapped to a top category in the English ODP. Therefore, we have 14 categories for both Chinese and English Web pages in this experiments. represents the detailed description for our data collection. From the table, it can be seen that, the number of English labeled Web pages is much larger than that of Chinese ones in ODP, which indicates English laData preprocessing has been applied to the raw data. First, all the Chinese Web pages were translated by Google Translator . Then, we converted all the letters to lower cases, and stemmed the words using the Porter's stemmer . After that, stop words were removed. In order to reduce the size of the feature space, we used a simple feature selection method, document frequency (DF) thresholding , to cut down the number of features, and speed up the classification. Based on , DF thresholding, which has comparable performance with information gain (IG) or CHI, is suggested since it is simplest with lowest cost in computation.

In the Games, \"qiyuan\", one of the famous online game in China, is the most frequent keyword, while it hardly appears in the English Web pages. This is due to the difference in culture between the Chinese and western societies. \"pingqiu\", which means \"draw\" in English, hardly appears in English Web pages, because the translator fails to provide a mapping between \"draw\" and it.

In particular, we have developed a novel method known as the information bottleneck technique to address the topic drift and different feature-space problems across two languages. Our method brings out a common part between the Chinese and English Web pages, which can be used to encode similar pages in different languages into the same codewords (class labels).
