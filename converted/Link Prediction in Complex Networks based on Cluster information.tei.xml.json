               "Cluster in graphs is densely connected group of vertices sparsely connected to other groups. Hence, for prediction of a future link between a pair of vertices, these vertices common neighbors may play different roles depending on if they belong or not to the same cluster. Based on that, we propose a new measure (WIC) for link prediction between a pair of vertices considering the sets of their intra-cluster or within-cluster (W) and between-cluster or inter-cluster (IC) common neighbors. Also, we propose a set of measures, referred to as W forms, using only the set given by the within-cluster common neighbors instead of using the set of all common neighbors as usually considered in the basic local similarity measures. Consequently, a previous clustering scheme must be applied on the graph. Using three different clustering algorithms, we compared WIC measure with ten basic local similarity measures and their counterpart W forms on ten real networks. Our analyses suggest that clustering information, no matter the clustering algorithm used, improves link prediction accuracy."

               "Many social, biological, and information systems can be naturally described as networks, where vertices represent entities (individuals or organizations) and links denote relations or interactions between vertices , . Networks or graphs are a powerful representation that has been employed in different tasks of machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM). This growing interest in the use of graph can be justified by the expressiveness of this representation and its applications include: supervised learning , , ; unsupervised learning , , , ; and semi-supervised learning , , , to cite just a few.",
               "An important scientific issue regarding network analysis that has attracted increasing attention in recent years is the link prediction. The link prediction problem aims to estimate the likelihood of the future existence of a link between two disconnected vertices in a network, based on the observed links .",
               "Many methods for link prediction based on similarity between vertices have been proposed since similar vertices likely share the same relations (links). When the similarity between vertices is based solely on network structure, it is called structural similarity. Structural similarity measures can be classified in different ways, such as the based on local or global information, refer to for details.",
               "Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg and systematically compared a number of structural similarity measures on real networks. According to the authors, global measure can provide higher accuracy, but its computation is very time-consuming and usually infeasible for large-scale networks, while local measure is generally faster but with lower accuracy.",
               "Common Neighbors (CN) is one of the simplest similarity measures based on local information that leads to a good performance. In networks with large clustering coefficient, i.e., if there are connections between a vertex a and two vertices b and c, probably there is a link between b and c, CN provides accurate predictions compared to measures based on global information . The basic assumption of CN is that two vertices are more likely to be connected if they have more common neighbors. Thus, each common neighbor gives equal contribution to the connection likelihood. However, sometimes different common neighbors may play different roles and by identifying them may lead to more accurate prediction than CN . For instance, the common friends in a same social group of two people who do not know each other may contribute more to their possibly future friendship than their common friends from different social groups.",
               "Furthermore, in recent experiments on synthetic and real-world networks, Feng and colleagues found that for a network with low clustering structure link prediction measures based on structural similarity perform poorly. Nonetheless, as the clustering structure of the network grows, the accuracy of these measures drastically improves . Inspired by these results, here, we firstly apply a partitioning scheme to divide the network into communities and then we explicitly use the obtained clustering structure information in the link prediction.",
               "Considering that, to the connection likelihood between a pair of vertices, their common neighbors may contribute in different ways depending on if they belong or not to the same cluster, here we propose a new measure (WIC) for predicting link between a pair of vertices using information from intra-cluster or within-cluster (W) and inter-cluster (IC) common neighbors of these vertices. Also, considering solely the subset of within-cluster common neighbors instead of the set of all common neighbors, we also propose other measures, called W forms, derived from the basic local measures. Consequently, a clustering scheme must be applied on the graph analyzed before computing these measures. Thus, using three different clustering algorithms: FastQ (FQ) , an algorithm based on edge clustering coefficient (ECC) , and WalkTrap (WT) . We compare the WIC measure with ten local similarity measures and their corresponding W forms on ten real networks. We show that cluster information about vertices, no matter the clustering algorithm used, improves the accuracy of link prediction over local similarity measures.",

In Section 3 we present ten different local similarity measures and their corresponding W forms. In Section 4 we present experimental results on ten real networks drawn from disparate fields. Finally, in Section 5 we present the conclusions and discuss future work."
