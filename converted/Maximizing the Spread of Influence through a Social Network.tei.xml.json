               "Keywords Models for the processes by which ideas and influence propagate through a social network have been studied in a number of domains , including the diffusion of medical and technological innovations , the sudden and widespread adoption of various strategies in game-theoretic settings, and the effects of \"word of mouth\" in the promotion of new products. Recently, motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target? We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most influential nodes is NP-hard here, and we provide the first provable approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions , we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63% of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of influence problems in social networks. We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees , our approximation algorithms significantly out-perform node-selection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the field of social networks. approximation algorithms, social networks, viral marketing, diffusion of innovations"

Consider an arbitrary function f () that maps subsets of a finite ground set U to non-negative real numbers. We say that f is submodular if it satisfies a natural \"diminishing returns\" property: the marginal gain from adding an element to a set S is at least as high as the marginal gain from adding Due to its generality, this result has found applications in a number of areas of discrete optimization (see e.g. ); the only direct use of it that we are aware of in the databases and data mining literature is in a context very different from ours, for the problem of selecting database views to materialize .",
               "Our strategy will be to show that for the models we are considering, the resulting influence function() is submodular. A subtle difficulty lies in the fact that the result of Nemhauser et al. assumes that the greedy algorithm can evaluate the underlying function exactly, which may not be the case for the influence function(A). However, by simulating the diffusion process and sampling the resulting active sets, we are able to obtain arbitrarily close approximations to(A), with high probability. Furthermore, one can extend the result of Nemhauser et al. to show that for any> 0, there is a> 0 such that by using (1 +)-approximate values for the function to be optimized, we obtain a (1 ? 1/e ?)-approximation.",

We show in Section 6 how, with a more careful hill-climbing algorithm and a generalization of Theorem 2.1, we can obtain comparable approximation guarantees in this setting.",
               "A further extension is to assume that each node v has an associated non-negative weight wv, capturing how important it is that v be activated in the final outcome. (For instance, if we are marketing textbooks to college teachers, then the weight could be the number of students in the teacher's class, resulting in a larger or smaller number of sales.) If we let B denote the (random) set activated by the process with initial activation A, then we can define the weighted influence functionw(A) to be the expected value over outcomes B of the quantity vB wv. The influence function studied above is the special case obtained by setting wv = 1 for all nodes v. The objective function with weights is submodular whenever the unweighted version is, so we can still use the greedy algorithm for obtaining a (1 ? 1/e ?)-approximation. Note, however, that a sampling algorithm to approximately choose the next element may need time that depends on the sizes of the weights."

Continuing this reasoning, we can in fact assume that for each pair of neighbors (v, w) in the graph, a coin of bias pv,w is flipped at the very beginning of the process (independently of the coins for all other pairs of neighbors), and the result is stored so that it can be later checked in the event that v is activated while w is still inactive.",

In the proof of Theorem 2.2, we constructed an equivalent process by initially resolving the outcomes of some random choices, considering each outcome in isolation, and then averaging over all outcomes. For the Linear Threshold Model, the simplest analogue would be to consider the behavior of the process after all node thresholds have been chosen.

The selected edge is declared to be \"live,\" and all other edges are declared to be \"blocked.\" (Note the contrast with the proof of Theorem 2.2: there, we determined whether an edge was live independently of the decision for each other edge; here, we negatively correlate the decisions so that at most one live edge enters each node.)",

We compare our greedy algorithm with heuristics based on nodes' degrees and centrality within the network, as well as the crude baseline of choosing random nodes to target. The degree and centrality-based heuristics are commonly used in the sociology literature as estimates of a node's influence . The high-degree heuristic chooses nodes v in order of decreasing degrees dv. Considering high-degree nodes as influential has long been a standard approach for social and other networks , and is known in the sociology literature as \"degree centrality\". \"Distance centrality\" is another commonly used influence measure in sociology, building on the assumption that a node with short paths to other nodes in a network will have a higher chance of influencing them. Hence, we select nodes in order of increasing average distance to other nodes in the network. As the arXiv collaboration graph is not connected, we assigned a distance of n -the number of nodes in the graph -for any pair of unconnected nodes. This value is significantly larger than any actual distance, and thus can be considered to play the role of an infinite distance. In particular, nodes in the largest connected component will have smallest average distance.",

In fact, the uneven nature of these curves suggests that the network influence of many nodes is not accurately reflected by their degree or centrality. shows the results for the weighted cascade model. Notice the striking similarity to the linear threshold model. The scale is slightly different (all values are about 25% smaller), but the behavior is qualitatively the same, even with respect to the exact nodes whose network influence is not reflected accurately by their degree or centrality. The reason is that in expectation, each node is influenced by the same number of other nodes in both models (see Section 2), and the degrees are relatively concentrated around their expectation of 1.",
               "The graph for the independent cascade model with probability 1%, given in , seems very similar to the previous two at first glance. Notice, however, the very different scale: on average, each targeted node only activates three additional nodes. Hence, the network effects in the independent cascade model with very small probabilities are much weaker than in the other models. Several nodes have degrees well exceeding 100, so the probabilities on their incoming edges are even smaller than 1% in the weighted cascade model. This suggests that the network effects observed for the linear threshold and weighted cascade models rely heavily on low-degree nodes as multipliers, even though targeting high-degree nodes is a reasonable heuristic. Also notice that in the independent cascade model, the heuristic of choosing random nodes performs significantly better than in the previous two models. marginal gain afterwards. Hence, its active set keeps growing, although at a much smaller slope than in other models.",

Because it does not focus exclusively on central nodes, it eventually targets nodes with additional marginal gain, and surpasses the two centrality-based heuristics. The improvement in performance of the \"random nodes\" heuristic is even more pronounced for the independent cascade model with probabilities equal to 10%, depicted in . In that model, it starts to outperform both the high-degree and the central nodes heuristics when more than 12 nodes are targeted. It is initially surprising that random targeting for this model should lead to more activations than centrality-based targeting, but in fact there is a natural underlying reason that we explore now.",

However, any additional nodes will only reach a small additional fraction of the network. In particular, other central or high-degree nodes are very likely to be activated by the initially chosen one, and thus have hardly any marginal gain. This explains the shapes of the curves for the high-degree and centrality heuristics, which leap up to about 2415 activated nodes, but make virtually no progress afterwards. The greedy algorithm, on the other hand, takes the effect of the first chosen node into account, and targets nodes with smaller General Threshold and Cascade Models. We have thus far been considering two specific, widely studied models for the diffusion of influence. We now propose a broader framework that simultaneously generalizes these two models, and allows us to explore the limits of models in which strong approximation guarantees can be obtained. Our general framework has equivalent formulations in terms of thresholds and cascades, thereby unifying these two views of diffusion through a social network.",
               "? A general threshold model. We would like to be able to express the notion that a node v's decision to become active can be based on an arbitrary monotone function of the set of neighbors of v that are already active. Thus, associated with v is a monotone threshold function fv that maps subsets of v's neighbor set to real numbers in , subject to the condition that fv(?) = 0. The diffusion process follows the general structure of the Linear Threshold Model. Each node v initially choosesv uniformly at random from the interval . Now, however, v becomes active in step t if fv(S)v, where S is the set of neighbors of v that are active in step t ? 1. Note that the Linear Threshold Model is the special case in which each threshold function has the form fv(S) = uS bv,u for parameters bv,u such that bv,u1.",

               "? A general cascade model. We generalize the cascade model to allow the probability that u succeeds in activating a neighbor v to depend on the set of v's neighbors that have already tried. Thus, we define an incremental function pv(u, S)[0, 1], where S and {u} are disjoint subsets of v's neighbor set. A general cascade process works by analogy with the independent case: in the general case, when u attempts to activate v, it succeeds with probability pv(u, S), where S is the set of neighbors that have already tried (and failed) to activate v. The Independent Cascade Model is the special case where pv(u, S) is a constant pu,v, independent of S. We will only be interested in cascade models defined by incremental functions that are order-independent in the following sense: if neighbors u1, u2, . . . , u try to activate v, then the probability that v is activated at the end of these attempts does not depend on the order in which the attempts are made. These two models are equivalent, and we give a method to convert between them. First, consider an instance of the general threshold model with threshold functions fv. To define an equivalent cascade model, we need to understand the probability that an additional neighbor u can activate v, given that the nodes in a set S have already tried and failed. If the nodes in S have failed, then node v's thresholdv must be in the rangev(fv(S), 1]. However, subject to this constraint, it is uniformly distributed.Thus, the probability that a neighbor u /S succeeds in activating v, given that the nodes in S have failed, is fewer than n + k are. But this would solve the underlying instance of Set Cover, and therefore is impossible assuming P = NP.",

We start with the construction from the proof of Theorem 2.4, letting u1, . . . , un denote the nodes corresponding to the n elements; i.e. ui becomes active when at least one of the nodes corresponding to sets containing ui is active. Next, for an arbitrarily large constant c, we add N = n c more nodes x1, . . . , xN ; each xj is connected to all of the nodes ui, and it becomes active only when all of the ui are.",

In total, at least N + n + k nodes will be active. Conversely, if there is no set cover of size k, then no targeted set will activate all of the ui, and hence none of the xj will become active (unless targeted). In particular, fewer than n+k nodes are active in the end. If an algorithm could approximate the problem within n 1?for any, it could distinguish between the cases where N + n + k nodes are active in the end, and where Beyond the Independent Cascade and Linear Threshold, there are other natural special cases of the Triggering Model. One example is the \"Only-Listen-Once\" Model. Here, each node v has a parameter pv so that the first neighbor of v to be activated causes v to become active with probability pv, and all subsequent attempts to activate v deterministically fail. (In other words, v only listens to the first neighbor that tries to activate it.) This process has an equivalent formulation in the Triggering Set Model, with an edge distribution defined as follows: for any node v, the triggering set Tv is either the entire neighbor set of v (with probability pv), or the empty set otherwise. As a result, the influence function in the Only-Listen-Once Model is also submodular, and we can obtain a (1 ? 1/e ?)-approximation here as well.",
