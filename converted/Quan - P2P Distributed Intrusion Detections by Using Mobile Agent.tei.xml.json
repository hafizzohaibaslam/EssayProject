Traditional IDSs [1] [3] [4] [8] [10] normally have centralised and hierarchical architectures. In a traditional IDS, audit records data and network monitoring packets are collected from each host and analysed by a top central analyser. Then, the central analyser makes an estimation on whether there is an intrusion, and decides how to take actions against intrusions. Traditional IDSs have two obvious drawbacks. Firstly, the centralised and hierarchical architecture of traditional IDSs may lead to a single point failure. Within a hierarchical architecture, the failure of the central analyser (e.g. the central analyser is cracked by an attacker) would cause the whole system to be destructed. Secondly, the central anal-yser of a traditional IDS is easy to become the bottleneck of the whole system when there are many simultaneous client requests."

               "Security issues, such as network intrusion and virus infection, are becoming more and more serious with the growth of computer and network applications. Intrusion is \"a set of actions which attempt to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a resource\" . In order to prevent information from malicious attackers, Intrusion DeTo overcome the above two limitations of traditional IDSs, some researchers suggest to use Peer-to-Peer (P2P) IDSs instead of hierarchical IDSs. In a P2P IDS, each host can send detection request to other hosts of the system to check whether there are suspicious activities, and estimate whether the network is intruded. Without a centralised controller, single point failure can be avoided in P2P IDSs effectively. However, most current P2P IDSs only allow hosts of a system to obtain detection information from limited sources (e.g. direct-linked neighbours). This limitation may lead a system to make inaccurate decisions. For example, when a multi-hosts attack occurs, current P2P IDSs may not recognise it due to the limitation of information. Multihosts attack means an attacker simultaneously tries to attack multiple hosts of a network, such as doorknob and network browsing . The main feature of multi-hosts attack is that the activity level of the attacker on each host may not be sufficiently high enough to raise an alarm to the whole network. However, if a distributed intrusion detection system can collect and analyse correlated information from multiple hosts, it might recognise this attack. The motivation of this research is to develop a distributed intrusion detection framework by taking advantages of mobile agent technique and P2P architecture so as to overcome some limitations of current P2P IDSs.",
               "In this paper, a P2P Distributed Intrusion Detection Framework by Using Mobile Agents (MADIDF) is proposed. Mobile agents are intelligent agents that can migrate among hosts. They can execute tasks autonomously in dynamic environments. In MADIDF, mobile agents are used to travel among hosts and detect intrusion of a system. A host can send mobile agents to other hosts in the network to gather relevant information from multiple hosts (the exact number of hosts is dependent on the specific multi-hosts attack) and recognise the aforementioned multi-hosts attacks. In addition, P2P architecture can avoid single point failure and decrease overhead of each host.",

In Section 3, the architecture of MADIDF is proposed and each component in the framework is introduced in detail. In Section 4, a novel mobile agent migration strategy is proposed to allow agents traveling on the P2P network effectively. Experiment and analysis are presented in Section 5. Finally, the paper is concluded and the further research is outlined in Section 6."

The coordination agent communicates with other basic agents and directs them to perform certain functions cooperatively.

They periodically send mobile agents to their neighbours to detect intrusions. When anomalous behaviours are detected, the observer neighbour initiates a voting process. It sends a mobile agent with a voting sheet to other neighbours of the compromised host for cooperative decision. This system can totally avoid single point failure problem. However, each host in the network has to store critical information of its neighbours which is a burden for each host, and periodic detection may result in network overload and have negative impact on the system overall performance.",

However, the host in the network only dispatches a mobile agent to its neighbours when a suspicious incident is observed at that host instead of periodically sending mobile agent to its neighbours. Although this system overcomes some drawbacks of that proposed in , it still has a few limitations. Because the host in the network only asks its neighbours for collaborative decision, it might not detect some specific attacks, which simultaneously attack multiple hosts in a network, like doorknob and network browsing.",

Furthermore, Intrusion detections in MADIDF are not only relied on direct-linked neighbours of a particular host, but also other hosts in the network. In this way, the original host can obtain more information to achieve a more accurate decision."

               "In order to test the general performance of MASHD and MADIDF, the experiment is performed in four different network scales which include ten hosts, twenty hosts, fifty hosts, and one hundred hosts. The topology of network is generated randomly, and the host which suspects a multihosts attack occurring and other hosts which are attacked by the multi-hosts attack are also randomly selected from all hosts in the network. Some terms, which will be used in the experiment, are defined as follows: shows the detection precisions of MASHD and MADIDF. From , it can be seen that the precision of MADIDF is much higher than that of MASHD. This is because that initiators in MASHD just obtain information from its one hop neighbours, while initiators in MADIDF obtain information not only from neighbours but from more hosts. Therefore, hosts in MADIDF can obtain more related information from other hosts and make more accurate decisions. tions was introduced. Compared to , , and , MA-DIDF can gather information not only from neighbours of the compromised host but from more other hosts in the network that can lead to more accurate final decision. The future work of this research is to improve the performance of MADIDF, including optimizing the number of Retrieval Agents and avoiding duplicate detection, especially in large scale network and test it in real applications.

From these two figures, it can be seen that MADIDF has higher network latency and network load than MASHD. This is because initiators in MADIDF detect more hosts in the network which will spend more time and consume more network resources. However, it is also noticed that when the number of hosts is less than fifty, the network latency and network load of MADIDF and MASHD are very close.",
               "According to the above description, it is evident that the detection precision of MADIDF is much better than MASHD. Although network latency and network load of MADIDF are higher than those of MASHD, the gap is very small, especially in medium or small scale network. Therefore, MADIDF uses time and resource to trade higher detection precisions. Since detection precision is the most important factor to evaluate whether a IDS is secure, we can conclude that the overall performance of MADIDF is better than MASHD."
