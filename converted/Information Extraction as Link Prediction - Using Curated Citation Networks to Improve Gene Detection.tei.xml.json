Specifically , we examine whether knowing something about which genes an author has previously written about, combined with information about previous coauthors and citations, can help us predict which new genes the author is likely to write about in the future. Framed in this way, the problem becomes one of predicting links between authors and genes in the publication network. We show that this solely social-network based link prediction technique outperforms various baselines, including those relying only on non-social biological information ."

               "Social networks, in the form of bibliographies and citations, have long been an integral part of the scientific process. Most scientists begin their exploration of a new problem with an intense investigation of the relevant literature. In a new or small field, for which the universe of such citations is relatively small, both a broad and deep search is manageable. As the size of the set of related papers grows, however, a researcher's time and attention can easily become overwhelmed. While the Internet has provided scientists with new tools for performing these literature reviews more quickly and precisely, it is usually left up to the user to guide the search themselves. In other words, one has to know what she is looking for. At the same time the space of accessible, and possibly relevant, papers has increased even more swiftly, leaving many valuable publications undiscovered. This is the problem we address in this paper: how to leverage the information contained within these publication networks, along with information concerning the individual publications themselves and a user's history, to help predict which entities the user might be most interested in and thus intelligently guide his search.",
               "Specifically, our application domain is the task of predicting which genes and proteins a biologist is likely to write about in the future (for the rest of the paper we will use the term 'gene' to refer both to the gene and gene product, or protein). We define a citation network as a graph in which publications and authors are represented as nodes, with bidirectional authorship edges linking authors and papers, and uni-directional citation edges linking papers to other papers (the direction of the edge denoting which paper is doing the citing and which is being cited). We can construct such a network from a given corpus of publications along with their lists of cited works. There exist many so called curated literature databases for biology in which publications are tagged, or manually labeled, with the genes with which they are concerned. We can use this metadata to introduce gene nodes to our enhanced citation network, which are bidirectionally linked to the papers in which they are tagged. Finally, we exploit a third source of data, namely biological domain expertise in the form of ontologies and databases of facts concerning these genes, to create association edges between genes which have been shown to relate to each other in various ways. We call the entire structure an annotated citation network.",
               "Although academics have long recognized and investigated the importance of such networks, their investigations have often been focused on historical , summary, or explanatory purposes . While other work has been concerned with understanding how influence develops and flows through these networks , we instead focus on the problem of link prediction . Link prediction is the problem of predicting which nodes in a graph, currently unlinked, \"should\" be linked to each other, where \"should\" is defined in some application-specific way. This may be useful to know if a graph is changing over time (as in citation networks when new papers are published), or if certain edges may be hidden from observation (as in detecting insider trading cabals). In our setting, we seek to discover edges between authors and genes, indicating genes about which an author has yet to write, but which he may be interested in.",
               "While there has been extensive work on analyzing and exploiting the structure of networks such as the web and citation networks ), most of the techniques used for identifying and extracting biological entities directly from publication text and curated databases ( ) rely on performing named entity recognition on the text itself (Collins and Singer 1999) and ignore the underlying network structure entirely. While these techniques perform well given a paper to analyze, they are impossible to use when such text is unavailable, as in our link prediction task.",

By selectively removing edges of a certain type from the F U LL graph we were able to isolate the effects of these relations on the random walk and, ultimately, the predicted links. Specifically, we classify each graph into one of four groups and later use this categorization to assess the relative contribution of each edge type to the overall link prediction performance. in the query set, we perform our walk simultaneously from each one. After each step in our walk we have a probability distribution over all the nodes of the graph, representing the likelihood of a walker, beginning at the query node(s) and randomly following outbound edges in the way described, of being on that particular node. Under the right conditions, after enough steps this distribution will converge. We can then use this distribution to rank all the nodes, predicting that the nodes most likely to appear in the walk are also the nodes to which the query node(s) should most likely connect. In practice, the same results can be achieved by multiplying the adjacency matrix of the graph by itself. Each such multiplication represents one complete step in the walk."

Since there are 5,816 gene names, and on average each author in our query set writes about 6.7 new genes in 2008, the chance of randomly guessing one of these correctly is 6.7/5816 = .12%. Using these values we can extrapolate this model's expected precision, recall and F1. Relatedly, ALL P AP ERS, while also independent of authors, nevertheless takes into account the distribution of genes across papers in the training graph. Thus its predictions are weighted by the number of times a gene was written about in the past. This model provides a more reasonable baseline. AU T HORS considers the distribution of genes over all papers previously published by the author. While this type of model may help recover previously published genes, it may not do as well identifying new genes."

Since these baselines do not depend on the query, they are constant across models and are thus displayed as horizontal lines across the charts in . AU T HORS is missing because it is only able to discover genes that have already been written about by the query authors in the training graph. Since our evaluation metrics only count the prediction of novel genes, AU T HORS's performance is necessarily zero.",
               "Given these baselines, let us next consider the role of author position on prediction performance. It is apparent from the results that, in almost all settings, querying based on the first author of a paper generates the best results, with querying by last author performing the worst. This seems to suggest that knowing the first author of a paper is more informative than knowing who the last author was in terms of predicting which genes that paper may be concerned with. Depending on the specifics of one's own discipline, this may be surprising. For example, in computer science it is often customary for an advisor, lab director or principal investigator to be listed as the last author. One might assume that the subject of that lab's study would be most highly correlated with this final position author, but the evidence here seems to suggest otherwise. Tellingly, the only case in which the last author is most significant 4 is in the CIT AT ION S CIT ED model. Recall that in this model edges from cited papers to their citing papers are present. These results may suggest that in this model, knowing the last author of the paper actually is more valuable.",
               "Given that in most cases the models queried using first authors performed the best, the columns of have been positioned in order of increasing first author F1 performance, and all subsequent comparisons are made with respect to the first author queries, unless otherwise stated. Thus we notice that those models relying solely on the biological GO information relating genes to one another (Content graphs from ) perform significantly worse than any other model, and are in fact in the same range as the U N IF ORM model. Indeed, the F U LL model benefits from having the relations removed, as it is outperformed by the F U LL M IN U S RELAT ED GEN ES model.",
               "There are a few possible explanations for why these content-based biological edges might be hurting performance. First, scientists might not be driven to study genes which have already been demonstrated to be biologically related to one another. Since we are necessarily using biological facts already discovered, we may be behind the wave of new investigation. Second, these new investigations, some of them biologically motivated, might not always turn out conclusively or successfully. This would likewise lead to the genes being studied in this way lying outside the scope : Mean percent precision, recall and F1 @20 of queries across graph types, broken down by author position, shown with error bars demarking the 95% confidence interval. Baselines U N IF ORM and ALL P AP ERS are also displayed. of our biological content. Finally, it is possible that our methods for parsing and interpreting the GO information and extracting the relationships between genes may not be capturing the relevant information in the same way a trained biologist might be able to. Relatedly, the ontologies themselves might be designed more for summarizing the current state of knowledge, rather than suggesting promising areas of pursuit."

While each of these social edge types is helpful on its own, their full combination is, perhaps counter-intuitively, not the best performing model. Indeed, while F U LL outperforms 5 its constituent CIT AT ION S and COAU T HORS models, it nevertheless benefits slightly 8 from having the coauthor edges removed (as in F U LL M IN U S COAU T HOR). This may be due to competition among the edges for the probability being distributed by our random walk. The more paths there are out of a node, the less likely the walker is to follow any given one. Thus, by removing the (many) coauthorship edges from the F U LL graph, we allow the walk to reach a better solution more quickly.",
               "Interestingly, the best performance 9 of the single-author query models is achieved by the relatively simple, pure collaborative filtering RELAT ED P AP ERS model ). Explained in words, this social model predicts that authors are likely to write about genes that cooccur with an author's previously studied genes in other people's papers. This makes sense since, if other people are writing about the same genes as the author, they are more likely to share other common interests and thus would be the closest examples of what the author may eventually become interested in in the future.",
               "Finally we examine the question of whether having not only a known author to query, but also one of this author's new genes, aids in prediction. The results for the F U LL(AU T HOR + 1 GEN E) model 10 seem to indicate that the answer is yes. Adding a single known new gene to our author query of the F U LL model improves our prediction performance by almost 50%, and significantly outperforms 11 the best single-author query model, RELAT ED P AP ERS, as well. This is a promising result, as it suggests that the information contained in our network representation can be combined with other sources of data (gleaned from performing information extraction on papers' text, for example) to achieve even better results than either method alone.",
               "In this paper we have introduced a new graph-based annotated citation network model to represent various sources of information regarding publications in the biological domain. We have shown that this network representation alone, without any features drawn from text, is able to outperform competitive baselines. Using extensive ablation studies we have investigated the relative impact of each of the different types of information encoded in the network, showing that social knowledge often trumps biological content, and demonstrated a powerful tool for both combining and isolating disparate sources of information.",
               "We have further shown that, in the domain of Saccharomyces research from which our corpus was drawn, knowing who the first author of a paper is tends to be more informative than knowing who the last author is (contrary to some conventional wisdom). Finally, we have shown that, despite performing well on its own, our network representation can easily be further enhanced by including in the query set other sources of knowledge about a prediction subject gleaned from separate techniques, such as information extraction and document classification. It is still unclear, however, exactly how much such information can be combined before diminishing returns are encountered. For instance, we know that adding a single new query significantly improves prediction accuracy, but what about adding a second or third gene? Relatedly, does it matter if the gene provided is relatively common or rare in the over distribution of genes across publications? Does knowledge of a harder to recognize gene provide more benefit that an easy one?",
               "Following up on an existing model of document structure , we hope to extend this annotated citation network model to include the text and structure of the document itself. In this proposed model, different sections of a document, such as the abstract and image captions, along with the words that occur in those sections, would be represented as nodes in a document graph, with edges connecting related entities (such as the sequential ordering of paragraphs or cross-referencing of images and citations in the text).",
               "We also see value in incorporating a temporal dimension to our network. In our current model all edges are walked upon with equal probability, regardless of the temporal distance between the two connected nodes. We might do better by taking this time distance into account: for example, coauthorship on a paper 20 years ago may carry less weight than a collaboration just a few years ago.",
               "In addition to leveraging traditional information extraction techniques to aid in our graph search, as already demonstrated, we would also like to explicitly model the text of the document as a graph ). For example, yeast gene names share morphological features: all genes sharing the same three letter prefix are functionally related. We hope to improve performance by modeling these types of relationship graphically.",
               "We are also interested in the other direction: incorporating the results of graphical methods into standard information extraction techniques. Since the end result of our link prediction algorithm is a distribution over nodes, one simple way to do this would be to use that distribution as a prior for any number of probabilistic information extraction methods."
