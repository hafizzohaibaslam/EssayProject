               "Coalition formation is one of the fundamental research problems in multi-agent systems . Most studies of coalition formation in the multi-agent systems community are based on models taken from the field of cooperative game theory (e.g., characteristic function games , non-transferable utility games , or hedonic games ). However, while such game models are useful for illustrating key concepts in coalition formation, they are often too abstract to be useful in modeling real-world cooperative scenarios. A challenge for multi-agent systems researchers is therefore to investigate the extent to which these models can be enriched in order to adequately model real-world scenarios, while ensuring that such additional expressive power does not bring with it computational intractability. One gross simplifying assumption made in most cooperative game models is that any coalition can form. In practice, in any real-world organization, there are a huge number of factors that must be taken into account when considering which coalitions can form, that will inevitably rule out from consideration the formation of some coalitions. One issue that would surely be taken into account when forming coalitions in most real-world organizations is that of the interpersonal relationships between potential coalition members. For example, irrespective of the personal skills of the relevant individuals, in a mission-critical situation, we would typically not seek to form a coalition from individuals that were not acquainted, or that did not have a proven track record of being able to cooperate effectively. It is, of course, precisely these concerns that lead organizations to undertake team-building initiatives and the like, with the goal of either establishing or further strengthening interpersonal relationships between potential team members. In this paper, we therefore consider the problem of how models, concepts, and techniques from cooperative game theory can be adapted to capture such concerns. We consider the following scenario. We are given a weighted graph representing a social network: vertices are agents, edges indicate acquaintance relationships between agents, and the weight of an edge indicates the strength of the relationship. Weights may be positive or negative, with negative weights indicating that the respective agents will not be able to successfully cooperate. The utility an agent obtains from being part of a coalition is then simply defined to be the sum of weights of edges in the social network for agents in his coalition that he is acquainted with. The value of a coalition is defined to be the sum of utilities of the agents in that coalition. We then assume there is a central body who wants to build coalitions to carry out k tasks. Thus, the centre wants to build a coalition structure containing k coalitions. However, in our setting, we assume that the centre has some capability to adapt the game, by building relationships between agents (adding edges to the social network), although such relationship building is assumed to have an associated cost. Thus, the problem of the centre involves trading off the cost of creating such relationships against the benefits that this brings to coalition formation.",
               "In this setting, allowing for the possibility of adding new relationships to the social network, we investigate two problems. The first is that of creating coalition structures that maximize social welfare (i.e., maximize the sum of the values of coalitions within a coalition structure). We first establish some general results on this problem, relating to the cost of forming a new relationship in the social network. We then identify cases where the problem is tractable. For example, we show that the problem of computing a coalition structure that maximizes social welfare can be solved in polynomial time if there are only a small number of negative edges in the social network. We note that we do not impose any other restrictions on the structure of the social network, in contrast to much related work . We then go on to consider the computation of core stable coalition structures to carry out exactly k tasks. We first illustrate how core stable coalitions and coalition structures that maximize social welfare are different, and we then consider cases where the problem is intractable (NP-hard), and isolate cases where it is solvable in polynomial time. Again, we find that the problem can be solved in polynomial time if there are only a small number of negative relationships in the social network. The motivation for considering maximizing social-welfare coalition structures is for situations where organizers can force people to be in groups and for core stable solutions is where the organizers cannot. In section 5 we discuss related work, and then present some conclusions.",

               "We will address scenarios in which a centralized organizer has the ability to adapt the game by adding edges to the social network G. Specifically, if (ai, aj) /E, then we assume the organizer is able to add an edge in a way that(ai, aj) = 1. Intuitively, adding an edge (ai, aj) implies creating a social working relationship between agents ai and aj where no such relationship existed before. In real-world scenarios, such working relationships are facilitated by a range of mechanisms, such as team-building exercises. Note that we do not consider the possibility that the organizer can change the weight of any existing edge. Moreover, by adding an edge, we assume the organizer incurs a fixed cost, denoted by, for every edge added.",

We use the following standard graph theoretic definitions. performing k tasks it is reasonable to assume that there should not be too many negative relations in the corresponding social network.

The essence of their polynomial time algorithm is recursively applying of an algorithm for MINIMUM-S-T-CUT with multiple sources and sinks. However, McCormick et al. showed how to solve the MINIMUM-S-T-CUT problem in polynomial time for nearly positive graphs. Their algorithm is easily generalized to multiple sources and sinks by adding a supersource node and a super-sink node, connected to the sources and sinks respectively with edge weight of. Therefore, by replacing the algorithm for MIN-S-T-CUT with multiple sources and sinks used by with the generalized version of the algorithm of we get a polynomial time algorithm for MINIMUM-K-CUT when k is fixed and the graph belongs to a family of nearly positive graphs, with a complexity of O(n",

               "Br?nzei and Larson in refer to the problem of maximizing the social welfare over all possible coalition structures, where we consider maximization only over those of size k. Hence, solutions to these two problems exhibit some similar properties and a few key differences. This will be the subject of discussion later on in this section. Now, as noted by , the coalition structure of size k which maximizes the social welfare is the one that minimizes the size of the k-cut. This is true because the sum of all edges is constant, so by minimizing the sum of edges outside the coalitions, we are maximizing the sum of edges that are within coalitions, a.k.a the social welfare. Thus we need to utilize an algorithm for MINIMUM-K-CUT in order to find the coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare. Note however, that MIN-K-CUT was shown to be NP-complete if the required partition size k is part of the input . Moreover, showed that MIN-K-CUT is W-hard even if all weights are positive; it implies that there is no possibility of finding an algorithm with a complexity of O(f (k)n c ), where f is an arbitrary function and c is a constant. Hence, we assume that k is fixed. Even with a fixed k, MIN-K-CUT is still hard when there are edges with negative weights by a simple reduction from MAX-CUT which is NP-Complete . We show that if the number of edges with negative weights is small, then MIN-K-CUT is in P . Now, since finding a coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare is equivalent to finding the MINIMUM-K-CUT, we get the following corollary: COROLLARY 2. Finding the coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare can be done in polynomial time if k is fixed and G belongs to a family of nearly positive graphs.",

First, it involves improving social welfare by facilitating social relationships between agents, i.e., by adding edges to the social network. Second, it involves finding an optimal partition of the agents. Note that, in general these component problems cannot be considered in isolation: deciding which social relationships to facilitate will in part depend on the partition of agents chosen, and choosing the optimal partition of agents will depend on the social network in place.

However, the new edges have an adjusted weights in order to simulate the cost incurred to the organizer (). The algorithm then finds the optimal coalition structure, denoted P * , in the temporary graph (line 2), which is possible to do in polynomial time according to Corollary 2. The algorithm concludes that the optimal edges to add to G are all the edges that are within a coalition in P * (line 3), and the coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare in G after adding the edges in E + Since Slashdot's dataset represents an undirected network, we defined the undirected edge weight to be the sum of the two directed edges between the nodes. Therefore, the weights of the edges vary between ?2 and 2. Using a subgraph of size 20, with 3 coalitions, and setting the cost of adding edges,, to 0.5, 1 or 1.5, we discovered that the organizer can improve the original social welfare by 150, 100 or 47 percent, respectively. As expected, the improvement decreases asincreases. Initial runs also suggest that the improvement increases as k decreases, and increases as the number of nodes increases (more possibilities to improve). Experiments and further analysis on real networks are a subject for future work. Now, we proceed to examine theoretically some aspects of stability. The coalition structure P * that maximizes the social welfare (after addition of edges by the organizer) does not necessarily belongs to the k-coalitions-core, as illustrated in .

Now, assume there is a proper 3-coloring, and let P = Ci, where Ci = {a l | the color i assigned i We now turn our attention to problems relating to the k-coalitions core.

               "to a l }. We show that P is a member of the 3-coalitions-core. First, it is clear that P consists of exactly 3 coalitions, since the coloring uses 3 colors. All the vertices with the same color are not adjacent (since this is a proper coloring), and therefore a vertex does not have any of its immediate neighbors in the same coalition. Hence, the utility of every agent is 0, which is the maximal value possible (since all weights are negative). Therefore, no agent can strictly benefit from moving to a different coalition or by leaving the game, which implies that P is a member of the 3-coalitions-core. For the other direction, assume that there exists a coalition structure P that is a member of the 3-coalitions-core. Moreover, assume that in P there are at least two adjacent vertices, ai, aj, in the same coalition. Thus, the utility of ai and aj is necessarily negative, and they would benefit from leaving the game. That is, P is not individually rational -a contradiction. Hence, in all of the coalitions of P there are no two adjacent vertices. By assigning the same color to all the vertices from the same coalition, we get a proper 3-coloring.",

               "We note that on nearly positive graphs, K-C-EXIST is still not trivial, since given a specific k, if G contains a sub-graph that is not k-colorable, then the k coalitions core does not exist, regardless of the size of the cover number.",
               "We now turn to the K-C-MEMBERSHIP problem. For this problem, we make use of the well-known CLIQUE problem.",

               "Similarly to the CORE-MEMBERSHIP problem in symmetric additively separable hedonic games, which is co-NP-complete , the following Theorem establishes that this is also the case with the k-coalitions-core. Below, we will examine conditions under which K-C-MEMBERSHIP is in P . THEOREM 7. For a social network with negative and positive weights, K-C-MEMBERSHIP is co-NP-complete, for every fixed k > 2.",
               "PROOF. First, we show membership in co-NP, by showing that the complement problem, i.e., determining that P is not a member of the k-coalitions-core, is in NP. Indeed, given a deviating subgroup of agents, it is easy to verify that all the members of the new coalition strictly benefit, and that the blocking coalition is valid (i.e., there are no more or less than k coalitions after the deviation).",
               "For hardness, we reduce the CLIQUE problem to the complement of K-C-MEMBERSHIP. For space reasons, we will present the general lines of the proof. Let (Gc, s) be an instance of CLIQUE, where Gc = (Vc, Ec) and |Vc| = nc. We construct an instance of the complement of K-C-MEMBERSHIP as follows. We set k = 3, and define A = VV{x1, x2, x3}, where V and V are a replica of the nodes in Vc. We define P = {C1, C2, C3} where C1 = {x1},C2 = {x2}V ,C3 = {x3}V . We would like to show that P is not a member of the 3-coalitions-core iff there exists a clique q of size s in Gc. Therefore, we set E such that the blocking coalitions can only be of a specific form that will indicate an existence of a clique, and vise versa. E is defined as follows: x1, x2, x3 are connected by edges of weight ?, which ensures they cannot be part of the same coalition, and each of them will always be a member of a different coalition. Now we set the rest of the weights: x2 is connected to nodes from V with ?, and receptively for x3 and V , to ensure that members of C2 or C3 will no deviate to each other's coalitions, and would only want to deviate to C1. The rest of the weights are assigned so that a blocking coalition may only be C1 joint with 2 replications of a clique of size s (one from V in C2 and one from V in C3). The exact technical details are omitted. in order to ensure that the possible deviating coalitions structures are valid in a sense that they have exactly k coalitions. Therefore, we choose k agents, one from each coalition, that are forced to remain in their original coalitions when considering deviations. We consider every such possible selections of k agents.",
               "A possible blocking coalition is a subgroup of agents deviating to an existing coalition (since there should remain exactly k coalitions). Therefore in step (4) we start iterating over all the coalitions, each time considering a deviation of a sub-group of agents to a specific coalition. Now, we need to consider the sub-group of deviating agents. All agents in the subgroup must strictly benefit from the deviation, as well as the agents in the coalition that the subgroup joins. Therefore, in step (6) we initially check a deviation to coalition Ci of all the agents (except the k chosen agents, to ensure k coalitions). Since all weights are non-negative, the utility function of an agent is monotonic in the sense that if an agent does not benefit from a certain coalition, it will not benefit from any of its sub-coalitions. Therefore, if there are some agents in the subgroup which do not benefit from the current deviation they cannot be a part of the deviating agents (since all other possible blocking coalitions deviating to Ci are sub-coalitions of the current one) and therefore we continue to check only the agents that did strictly benefit, and that are potentially a part of a blocking coalition. If some agents in Ci do not benefit from deviation to it, it means that Ci cannot be a part of the blocking coalition, and we need to consider the next possible coalition to deviate to: Ci+1. If all the agents in the deviation and in coalition Ci strictly benefit from it, then we found a blocking coalition, and therefore P is not a member of the k-coalitions-core. Thus, the algorithm enumerates all possible potentially blocking coalitions for P . If the algorithm did not discover such deviation, then P is guaranteed to be in the k-coalitions-core.",
               "As for the complexity, it is clear that Step (1) can be performed in polynomial time.",
               "Step (3) contains redundant calculations, but even so, its complexity can be bounded by n k = O(n k ).",
               "Step (4) is performed k times and step (6) is performed at most n times. Calculating the utility for every agent on step (8) takes O(n). In total, we get a complexity of O(kn k+2 ). Since k is fixed, this is a polynomial time algorithm.",
               "Let us now consider conditions under which K-C-MEMBERSHIP is in P . We show that when all the weights are non-negative and k is fixed, it is possible to iterate over all the potential blocking coalitions in polynomial time.",
               "What about the case where we might have a small number of negative edges? As before, we formally capture the notion of \"small number\" of negative edges, by the family of nearly positive graphs. In the following proof we will use algorithm 3, which is very similar to algorithm 2. However, algorithm 2 utilizes the advantage of having only non-negative weights. In that case, the utility function for every agent has a monotonicity property, in a sense that when an agent does not benefit from a coalition, she will not benefit from any of its sub-coalitions. Therefore, algorithm 2 does not need to consider all possible sub-coalitions of agents but only a linear number of them. When negative weights are allowed, this property does not hold anymore. Agents may well benefit from the removal of other agents with negative edges, thus the utility function is no longer monotonic. Nonetheless, when considering nearly positive graphs, we can still consider all possible subgroups of the vertex cover of the negative edges, while using the monotonicity for the rest of the agents. Therefore, Algorithm 3 is able to maintain the polynomial time complexity.",

               "Our model is a special case of symmetric additively separable hedonic games (symmetric ASHGs), which have been extensively studied in the field of multi-agent systems . However, we use the interpersonal relationships, as described by a social network, to define the utilities of the players in the coalition formation game. Br?nzei and Larson and Bachrach et al have also defined the utilities is such a way. However, Bachrach et al. in imposed some constraints on the structure of the social network, such as planar, minor free and bounded degree graphs, in order to come-up with constant factor approximations for the problem of maximizing the social welfare. We provide an exact algorithm using a constraint on the number of negative edges in the social network, but not on its structure. Br?nzei and Larson investigated properties of the coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare, the core, and the relationship among them, but did not provide algorithms to find them. In other work , Br?nzei and Larson use the social network to define the utilities of players, but in a different way. All of these works did not consider the possible requirement to form exactly k coalitions, in order to enable performing of k tasks. As we discussed in Section 3, this restriction adds some unique properties to the coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare, and we also had to introduce a modification of the well-known core solution concept, which we called the k-coalitions-core.",

In our model we do not use this constraint, since the organizer has the ability to facilitate relationships, and make introductions between unacquainted agents. Similarly to the problem that we have defined for the organizer, the work of considers a problem of rewiring the network to enable better team formation in agent organized networks (AON). The key difference is that in their model each agent is able to rewire its local neighborhood, while in our case there is a centralized organizer who can add edges throughout the entire network. Apart from applying local strategies, they also consider multiple iterations, as the agents adapt to the ongoing changes of the network."

We provided a polynomial time algorithm in the case of fixed k and nearly positive graphs for computing the optimal coalition structure and the optimal set of edges the organizer should add to the network.",

We concluded by characterizing several properties for the problem of adding edges to network in order to increase the social welfare of core stable solutions. Finding a polynomial time algorithm or an approximated heuristic to this problem is the subject of further research. Another future direction based on the model analyzed in this paper would be to consider skills for the agents, where each task requires a specific set of skills. Finally, in addition to pursuing theoretical directions, we also intend to run experiments on a real network data."
