               "As the population is rapidly aging, the intergenerational communication problem has attracted researchers all around the world. In this paper, we design a teachable agent in an intergenerational private social network to provide opportunities for the young and the old generations to find more common topics and interests. Besides the basic functions shared by most social network services, we provide two additional features which are specially designed for the elderly: Timeline based autobiography and topic match. The timeline based autobiography feature fulfills the needs of the elderly that they prefer to recall the past experience and to convey useful lessons to young people. The topic match feature helps the youngster to find their posts which the elderly would like to read from other social network services."

               "It has been reported that intergeneration communication typically takes two form, mesmerizing and painful experience. The elderly often talk about their past in the conversation, and as a special form 1 of reminiscing, painful experience sharing is additionally associated with providing lesson learnt and guidance to the young people . Therefore, we need to find a way to improve the intergenerational communication. Teachable Agents are computer agents whose aim is to help students learn through the learning by teaching approach. Rather than taking on the classic role of a teacher and spoonfeeding knowledge to learners, a teachable agent is designed as a naive learner who instead needs to be taught. A teachable agent mainly has three kinds of capabilities, to learn, to practice what has been taught, and to be affective during the interaction with uses. We believe that these capabilities not only attract young generations to teach the agent, but may also provide an effective interaction with the elderly, and further have the potential to improve the intergenerational communication qualities. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to design a teachable agent in an intergenerational private social network in order to provide opportunities for young generation and old generation to find more common topic and interests."

               "Past research in the context of western culture has shown that several factors affect the communication satisfaction. A study based on Bulgarian and American population suggested the factors that can predict communication satisfaction include communication avoidance from both sides, politeness, and communication respect. In , it claimed that mutuality is associated with higher level of happiness, relaxation, and lower frustration. Research done in Chinese culture context generally resonated with the findings above in western culture, with a few new findings. It was discovered in that helping conversations in which the young ask for advice from the elderly generally resulted in higher mutual satisfaction, due to existence of common topic and attitude of learning from older people's experience. Contrarily, respect, as a core value in Chinese intergeneration communication due to Xiao, was considered essentially in every conversation.",
               "Another important finding in intergeneration communication is that young people rated their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the result that young people rated intergeneration interactions as International Journal of Information Technology Vol. less satisfying overall than communicating with same-age-peers. Moreover, in most cases, it was the older person who was reportedly converging or attuning to the conversational needs of the young person . When communicating with youths, the elderly have reported feeling patronized by what they perceive as ageist sentiments . A report from the Research on Age Discrimination Project (RoAD) in which members of the elderly are interviewed proves this point, providing accounts of the harm experienced by the elderly, when excluded from an event based on their children's assumption that they would not enjoy it. Similar emotions were experienced when elders were made the subject of ageist humor . One of the most common and long held assumptions by society about the elderly is their lack of ability and willingness to master or adopt new technology compared to younger generations . Many of instances of ageism are unintended and carried out by a variety of family members including youths who are often unaware of their behaviour. To sum up, young generations have a dominant role in intergenerational communication. They tend to not attach importance to elderly, and have Stereotype that elderly people lack ability and willingness to master or adopt new technology. We should attract or persuade young people to spend more time with elderly and improve the communication satisfaction.",
               "Existing social networks as a communication tool should have helped on the intergenerational communication. However, the existing social networks such as QQ, Skype, WeChat, Facebook, Twitter have limitations to use in this situation. For elderly, the interface of existing platforms is not designed for the intergenerational communication problem. They are not intuitive and simple enough for them to use. For young generations, they are quite busy and may easily ignore the elderly's needs. Moreover, some of them even don't know what to talk about with their parents. Based on the above findings, we aim to design an intergenerational social network with teachable agents as mediation to mutually interact with both elderly and youngster."
