               "The importance of the ability to predict trends in social media has been growing rapidly in the past few years with the growing dominance of social media in our everyday's life. Whereas many works focus on the detection of anomalies in networks, there exist little theoretical work on the prediction of the likelihood of anomalous network pattern to globally spread and become \"trends\". In this work we present an analytic model for the social diffusion dynamics of spreading network patterns. Our proposed method is based on information diffusion models, and is capable of predicting future trends based on the analysis of past social interactions between the community's members. We present an analytic lower bound for the probability that emerging trends would successfully spread through the network. We demonstrate our model using two comprehensive social datasets-the Friends and Family experiment that was held in MIT for over a year, where the complete activity of 140 users was analyzed, and a financial dataset containing the complete activities of over 1.5 million members of the eToro social trading community."

One of the main challenges associated with modeling of behavioral dynamics in social communities stems from the fact that it often involves stochastic generative processes.

The results presented in this work are based on a pure theoretical analysis.",

Recently, Zaman et al. developed a method to trace rumors back in the topological spreading path to identify sources in a social network , and suggest that methods can be used to locate influencers in a network. Some scholars express their doubts and concerns for the influencer-driven viral marketing approach, suggesting that \"everyone is an influencer\" , and companies \"should not rely on it\" . They argue that the content of the message is also important in determining its spreads, and likely the adoption model we were using is not a good representation for the reality.",
               "Our work, on the other hand, focuses on predicting emerging trends given a current snapshot of the network and adoption status, rather than finding the most influential nodes. We provide a lower bound for the probability that an emerging trend would spread throughout the network, based on the analysis of the diffusion process outreach, which is largely missing in current literature. Adoption Model. A fundamental building block in trends prediction that is not yet entirely clear to scholars is the adoption model, modeling individuals' behavior based on the social signals they are exposed to. Centola has shown both theoretical and empirically that a complex contagion model is indeed more precise for diffusion . Different adoption models can dramatically alter the model outcome . In fact, a recent work on studying mobile application diffusions using mobile phones demonstrated that in real world the diffusion process is a far more complicated phenomenon, and a more realistic model was proposed in . Our results also incorporate this realistic diffusion model. Trends Prediction and Our Proposed Model. In this work we study the following question : Given a snapshot of a social network with some behavior occurrences (i.e. an emerging trend), what is the probability that these occurrences (seeds) will result in a viral diffusion and a wide-spread trend (or alternatively, dissolve into oblivion). Though this is similar to the initial seed selection problem , we believe that the key factor to succeed in a viral marketing campaign optimization is a better analytical model for the diffusion process itself.",
               "The main innovation of our model is the fact that it is based on a fully analytical framework with a scale-free network model. Therefore, we manage to overcome the dependence on simulations for diffusion processes that characterizes most of the works in this field . We are able to do so by decomposing the diffusion process to the transitive random walk of \"exposure agents\" and the local adoption model based on . While there are some works that analyze scale-free network most of them come short to providing accurate results, due to the fact that they calculate the expected values of the global behaviors dynamics. Due to strong \"network effect\" however, many real world networks display much less coherent patterns, involving local fluctuations and high variance in observed parameters, rendering such methods highly inaccurate and sometimes impractical. Our analysis on the other hand tackles this problem by modeling the diffusion process on scale-free networks in a way which takes into account such interferences, and can bound their overall effect on the network."
