               "We study the diffusion of information in an overlaying social-physical network. Namely, we consider a physical information network where information spreads amongst people through conventional communication media (e.g., face-to-face communication, phone calls), and conjoint to this physical network , there are online social networks where information spreads via web sites such as Facebook, Twitter, FriendFeed, YouTube, etc. Capitalizing on the theory of inhomogeneous random graphs, we quantify the size and the critical threshold of information epidemics in this conjoint social-physical network by assuming that information diffuses according to the SIR epidemic model. One interesting finding is that even if there is no percolation in the individual networks, percolation (i.e., information epidemics) can take place in the conjoint social-physical network. We also show, both analytically and experimentally, that the fraction of individuals who receive an item of information (started from an arbitrary node) is significantly larger in the conjoint social-physical network case, as compared to the case where the networks are disjoint. These findings reveal that conjoining the physical network with online social networks can have a dramatic impact on the speed and scale of information diffusion."

               "Modern society relies on basic physical network infrastructures, such as power stations, telecommunication networks and transportation systems. Recently, due to advances in communication technologies and cyber-physical systems, these infrastructures have become increasingly dependent on one another and have emerged as interdependent networks . One archetypal example of such coupled systems is the smart grid where the power stations and the communication network controlling them are coupled together. See the pioneering work of Buldyrev et al. (see also , , ) for a diverse set of models on coupled networks.",
               "Apart from physical infrastructure networks, coupling can also be observed between different types of social networks. Traditionally, people are tied together in a physical information network through old-fashioned communication media, such as face-to-face interactions. On the other hand, recent advances of Internet and mobile communication technologies have enabled people to be connected more closely through online social networks. Indeed, people can now interact through e-mail or online chatting, or communicate through a Web 2.0 website such as Facebook, Twitter, FriendFeed, YouTube, etc. Clearly, the physical information network and online social networks are not completely separate since people may participate in two or more of these networks at the same time. For instance, a person can forward a message to his/her online friends at Facebook and Twitter upon receiving it from someone via face-to-face communication. As a result, the information spread in one network may trigger the propagation in another network, and may result in a possible cascade of information. One conjecture is that due to this coupling between the physical and online social networks, today's hot spot news (and information in general) can spread at an unprecedented speed throughout the population, and this is the main subject of the current study.",
               "Information cascades over coupled networks can deeply influence the patterns of social behaviors. Indeed, people have become increasingly aware of the fundamental role of the coupled social-physical network as a medium for the spread of not only information but also ideas and influence. Twitter has emerged as an ultra-fast source of news and Facebook has attracted major businesses and politicians for advertising products or candidates. Several music groups or singers have gained international fame by uploading videos to YouTube. In almost all cases, a new video uploaded to YouTube, a rumor started in Facebook or Twitter, or a political movement advertised through online social networks, either dies out quickly or reaches a significant proportion of the population. In order to fully understand the extent to which these events happen, it is of great interest to consider the combined behavior of the physical information network and several online social networks.",
               "Despite the increasingly important role that coupled networks play in many aspects of modern society, there has been little study on information diffusions across such networks. Most existing works consider information (or disease) propagation only on a single network. For instance, the spread of diseases was studied using the classical susceptible-infectiousrecovered (SIR) and susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) models , , , for small-world networks , , scale-free networks , and networks with arbitrary degree distributions . Among them, Newman has shown that SIR epidemics can be quantified for a wide variety of networks by using percolation theory. In particular, the threshold and the size of epidemics are characterized by studying the phase transition properties of the underlying random graph models."

               "In this paper, we aim to develop a new theoretic framework towards understanding the characteristics of information diffusion across multiple networks. For illustration purposes, the model definitions are given in the context of an overlaying social-physical network. Specifically, there is a physical information network where the information spreads amongst people through conventional communication media (e.g., face-to-face communication, phone calls), and conjoint to this physical network, there are online social networks offering alternative platforms for information diffusion, such as Facebook, Twitter, FriendFeed, YouTube, etc.",
               "In the interest of easy exposition, we focus on the case where there exists only one online social network along with the physical information network; see for an extension to the multiple social networks case. We model the physical network and the social network as random graphs with different topology properties. We assume that each individual in the population is a member of the physical network, and becomes a member of the social network independently with a certain probability. It is also assumed that information is transmitted between two nodes (that are connected by a link in any one of the graphs) according to the SIR model; see Section II for precise definitions.",
               "The problem under consideration is intricate since the relevant random graph model corresponds to a union of coupled random graphs, and the techniques employed in , for single networks fall short of characterizing its phase transition properties. Capitalizing on the recent progress in inhomogeneous random graphs , , we show that the overlaying social-physical network exhibits a \"critical point\" above which information epidemics are possible; i.e., a single node can spread an item of information (a rumor, an advertisement, a video, etc.) to a positive fraction of individuals in the asymptotic limit. Below the critical point, only small information outbreaks can occur and the fraction of influenced individuals always tends to zero.",
               "We consider two different models for the individual networks. First, we assume that both the physical information network and the online social network are Erd? os-Rnyi (ER) graphs , and then we consider the case where both networks are random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions ; i.e., both networks are generated according to the configuration model , . In each case, we quantify the aforementioned critical point by computing the phase transition threshold of the conjoint random graph model, and show that it depends on both the degree distributions of the networks and the number of individuals that are members of the online social network. Further, we compute the probability for an information originating from an arbitrary individual to yield an epidemic along with the resulting fraction of individuals that are influenced; this is done for both cases by computing the giant component size of the corresponding models.",
               "The results show that the conjoint social-physical network can spread an item of information to a significantly larger fraction of the population as compared to the case where the two networks are disjoint. For instance, consider a physical information network W and an online social network F that are ER graphs with respective mean degreesw andf , and assume that each node in W is a member of F independently with probability. Ifw = 0.6 and= 0.2, we show that information epidemics are possible in the overlaying socialphysical network H = WF wheneverf0.77. In stark contrast, this happens only ifw > 1 orf > 1 when the two networks are disjoint. Furthermore, in a single ER network W withw = 1.5, an information item originating from an arbitrary individual gives rise to an epidemic with probability 0.58 (i.e., can reach at most 58% of the individuals). However, if the same network W is conjoined with an ER network F with= 0.5 andf = 1.5, the probability of an epidemic becomes 0.82 (indicating that up to 82% of the population can be influenced).",
               "To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work that characterizes the information diffusion across multiple networks. The techniques (and the model) presented in this paper can also pave the way in studying the influence maximization problem over multiple networks. We believe that our findings along this line shed light on the understanding on information (and influence) propagation across coupled socialphysical networks.",
