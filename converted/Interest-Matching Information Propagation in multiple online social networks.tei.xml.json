               "Online social networks have become an imperative channel for extremely fast information propagation and influence. Thus, the problem of finding a minimum number of seed users who can eventually influence as many users in the network as possible has become one of the central research topics recently. Unfortunately, most of related works have only focused on the network topologies and largely ignored many other important factors such as the users' engagements and the negative or positive impacts between users. More challengingly, the behavior of information propagation across multiple networks simultaneously remains an untrod-den area and becomes an urgent need. Our work is the first attempt to tackle the above problem in multiple networks , considering these lacking important factors. In order to capture the users' engagement, we propose to targeting the set of interest-matching users whose interests are similar to what we try to propagate. Then, we develop our Iterative Semi-Supervising Learning based approach to identify the minimum seed users. We validate the effectiveness of our solution by using real-world Twitter-Foursquare networks and academic collaboration multiple networks."

Many efficient solutions have been introduced in the literature for the information propagation problem, focusing on finding the smallest set of selected seed users with the biggest influence. However, these solutions heavily depend on the network topologies and ignore the crucial factors as discussed next.",
               "First of all, the above studies assume that a person is influenced, i.e., adopts a product, if many of his friends believe in the product, thus he will continue influencing others. However, consider an advertisement of a sport video game to a person who has absolutely no interest in it, that is, he has no engagement into the advertisement and will not propagate it further. Thus, one of the key factors for an effective propagation is to targeting the interest-matching users, whose interests are similar to what we try to propagate. Secondly, the existing works also ignore the negative and positive impacts between users. One word from a very trusted friend is worth more than thousand words from others. The challenges of studying information propagation not only include the above lacking factors but also advance to a higher level of difficulty when information can be propagated across several networks simultaneously. Due to this feature, a user can post his message in multiple OSNs simultaneously and influence many friends on both networks at the same time. Unfortunately, the behavior of this type of information propagation still remains unexplored.",
               "In this paper, we investigate the information propagation problem in multiple networks regarding the above mentioned lacking factors, called Minimum Seed multi-Information Propagation (MSIP), which seeks for the minimum number of seed users who can spread the information to as many as interest-matching users in multiple OSNs. This is the first attempt to study the information propagation problem in multiple networks considering other important properties: interest-matching users, user negative/positive relations, and message timeliness. We propose a graph-based model to couple the multiple networks together while still carry those properties intact. As one of the first work addressing the interest-matching users, we provide a semi-supervised learning based prediction approach which can predict a large amount of users' interests based on a very limited available information. After the prediction of interest-matching users, we propose two solutions based on a novel idea of iterative semi-supervised learning to the MSIP problem and its variants. The performance of our approaches is evaluated on two datasets, Twitter-Foursquare and academic collaboration multiple networks, in which we use online APIs to crawl their topologies and users' interests.",

Starting with an initial set of active nodes (seed users) A0, the dynamics of information propagation unfold round by round as follows.

Specifically, the purposes of these three items are as follows: the loss function forces the influenced users close to the interest-matching users after d rounds; the regularizer aims to minimize the number of seed users; the iteration function guarantees that the identified seed users in previous iterations will not be replaced by other users. Starting from the empty set, the seed users can be iteratively identified by solving the cost function using the ISSL approach.",

Roughly speaking, hub users are followed by users having the relevant interests and follower users are those following at least one hub user. The mutual relationship between hub and follower users is: a good hub user is followed by many good followers and a good follower follows many good hubs. As shown in , we use a simple method by selecting the follower users to be the users following at least one user and the hub nodes as the users having at least one follower. That is, by defining d the penalties of the incorrect predictions. Clearly, after minimizing PT , a user is more interested in Im if its entry of the interest-prediction label vector? is closer to 1 (less interested if closer to -1) according to the definition of the interest-available label vector ? .

Therefore, the hub user penalty P h is P f = The underlying intuition is that the two follower users are more likely to have the same interest if they closely follow some hub users; (3) when neither u nor v has the same interest as h's, there is no penalty for any classification of u and v due to the difficulty to measure the penalty in this case.",

In Foursquare, due to the lack of message dataset, we set the weights for each link to be 1. Furthermore, we associate users with various interests retrieved from the Klout API (for those available in Klout), which measures the impact of users on various topics based on the content they created. Among all the interests available in Klout, we map more than 2500 of them, covering a wide range of topics.

Consider the most popular 25 tags for documents in related areas via Mendeley API , such as community structure, solar cells, laser etc. The authors, according to their names, can be mapped to the detailed documents corresponding to these sub-areas.

In penalty function P , we set the large constantP to be 10000 and the normalized parameterto be 0.7, based on the fraction of hub users among all users, by considering larger penalties of the incorrect prediction between followers. reports the average AUC scores of interest-matching prediction in the above two datasets respectively. As can be seen, the AUC scores of prediction using our approaches arise with the increase of interest-available users. Even when there are only 30% interest-available users, the AUC score using TSNL reaches 0.7 in both datasets while the prediction on single network is a little bit less in Twitter-Foursquare networks and even less than 0.5 in academic collaboration networks. When given more than 60% interest-available users, our prediction is accurate since the AUC score is only a little bit smaller than 0.9. This reveals both the effectiveness of our approach and the importance of \"crossing users\" in multiple social networks. The underlying reason is that our approach (coupling and prediction method) takes into account that a crossing user can retweet or mention their messages on Twitter from Foursquare. That is, the interest similarity between such user and all neighbors in both networks are well reflected in the penalty function.",

Given different percentages of interest-matching users, we test on 100 users sampled from TFMN and ACMN using the unbiased sampling approach and evaluate the average performance of 100 samplings. In our experiments, we compare our TSNL approach with the following other solutions: MSIP-IP : the integral/optimal solution of equation ; Total-Single-IP : the sum of integral solution on all networks; and MSIP-IP-No-Interest: the optimal solution without considering interest-matching users. To solve the integer programming, we use a powerful matlab toolbox, YALMIP . In addition, we set the large constantI andin cost functions CT and CI to be 10000. As revealed in , most of the time our TSNL solution is very close to the optimal solutions of MSIP-IP (only at most 5% less than optimal) and even outperform the optimal Total-Single-IP. It implies that the existence of crossing users essentially helps to provide a more effective information diffusions by sharing their messages on multiple social networks. The interesting case is that they can even beat MSIP-IP sometimes, however, with the cost of lower TPR and TFR. The number of seed users and TPR/TNR are approaching optimal solution with the existence of more and more interest-matching users. Moreover, the integral solutions of MSIP-IP-No-Interest have comparatively lowest TPR and TNR although they can identify relatively smaller size of seed users. The true negative rate, as illustrated in , drops sharply with the increase of interestmatching users since the users who are not interested in the message cannot be successfully avoided when more users are required to be influenced. further reveals some interesting observations for different number of interest-matching users in larger sampling networks. The number of seed users almost keeps the same while the running time decreases rapidly and the TPR/TFR remain quite high after increasing the number of interest-matching users.
