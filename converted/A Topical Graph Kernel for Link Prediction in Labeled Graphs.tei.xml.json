               "This paper proposes a solution to the problem of link prediction in labeled graphs with additional text information associated with the nodes. By fitting a topic model on the text corpus and some processing, we compute the topics of interest to a node. We propose a walk based graph kernel which incorporates the node's interest and thus represents structural as well as textual information. We then make predictions about the existence of unseen links using a kernelized SVM. Our experiments with an author citation network shows that our method is effective and significantly outperforms a network-oriented approach. In this paper, we propose a graph kernel which we call the topical graph kernel to solve the task of link prediction in labeled graphs with additional text information associated with the nodes. Our kernel subsumes the idea of walk-based kernels (Li & Chen, 2009), and enriches them with textual data from nodes by using a topic model to represent node interest. We then make predictions about the existence of unseen links using a kernelized SVM. Our experiments on a citation graph of authors of scientific papers shows that our method significantly outperforms a network-oriented approach."

               "Link prediction is the problem of predicting future links within some graph structure (e.g. a social network or a citation network) given some snapshot of this graph at a preceding moment. Many approaches to the problem consider only the structural features intrinsic to the network itself , such as friendship links or citation links, and ignore the properties of the nodes themselves which could be social agents or scientific articles. Alternative approaches to link prediction incorporate intrinsic properties of nodes to both improve prediction performance and provide greater insight into the network. The node properties provide an alternative view into the network that complements approaches that subsist solely on the edges.",
               "The link prediction problem has been addressed by several researchers. There are node neighborhood based methods which work under the assumption that two nodes are likely to form link if their sets of neighbors have a large overlap. These techniques employ common neighbors ), Adamic-Adar Index , preferential attachment , etc. to measure neighborhood similarity. There are other ensemble-ofall-paths based approaches which refine the notion of shortest path distance by considering an ensemble of all paths ). Recently there have been attempts to enhance text models with information from graphs. address the problem of learning topic models on labeled graphs. They propose to regularize a topic model with a regularizer based on the graph structure. However, their approach does not directly apply to link prediction. and propose solutions to the citation prediction problem using topic models to model the parameters which determine if a given paper would cite another given document. However their method is limited to . AIG construction and random walks generation for a given link these neighboring nodes. The link which the AIG centers on is the focal link and the two nodes which are incident to this link are focal nodes. While training, since the truth is known, the focal link X ? Y will actually exist whereas during testing, one will have to construct the AIG assuming that the focal link exists. In the testing phase the classifier predicts how probable it is for this hypothetical focal link to exist. An example of an AIG induced from a bigger graph is shown in Part (ii) of . modeling existence of individual links and does not incorporate the graphical topology of the neighborhood."

Also, in order to test the sensitivity of the model towards skewness of the test sets, ratio of positive to negative links in the two test sets, Test Set1 and Test Set2, was kept different: 3:1 and 1:1 respectively. We also study the effect of training set size L and number of topics K on the performance of TGK on one of the test sets. Part (a) of shows a learning curve of the F-measure as the size of the training set is increased. While both methods benefit from an increase in train set size, we see that TGK constantly outperforms the baseline method. Also, for the smallest training set of size 100, the baseline method yields an F-measure of around 20% while the proposed approach still leads to reasonable accuracy (about 53%). Similarly, part (b) of shows that the performance of TGK increases with increase in number of topics. This happens because a higher K strengthens the representative power of the node vector and is better at modeling node interests."
