               "Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to build recommender systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. However, it cannot make recommendations for so-called cold start users that have rated only a very small number of items. In addition, these methods do not know how confident they are in their recommendations. Trust-based recommendation methods assume the additional knowledge of a trust network among users and can better deal with cold start users, since users only need to be simply connected to the trust network. On the other hand, the sparsity of the user item ratings forces the trust-based approach to consider ratings of indirect neighbors that are only weakly trusted, which may decrease its precision. In order to find a good trade-off, we propose a random walk model combining the trust-based and the collaborative filtering approach for recommendation. The random walk model allows us to define and to measure the confidence of a recommendation. We performed an evaluation on the Epinions dataset and compared our model with existing trust-based and collaborative filtering methods."

               "Typically in a recommender system, we have a set of users and a set of items. Each user u rates a set of items by some values. The recommender has the task to predict the rating for user u on a non-rated item i or to generally recommend some items for the given user u based on the ratings that already exist. Collaborative Filtering methods make recommendations based on the ratings of item i by a set of users whose rating profiles are most similar to that of user u. With the advent of online social networks, the trust-based approach to recommendation has emerged. This approach assumes a trust network among users and makes recommendations based on the ratings of the users that are directly or indirectly trusted by u.",
               "Collaborative Filtering is most effective when users have expressed enough ratings to have common ratings with other users, but it performs poorly for so-called cold start user. Cold start users are new users who have expressed only a few ratings. Using similarity based approaches, it is unlikely to find similar users since the cold start users only have a few ratings. Trust-based recommenders, however, can make recommendations as long as a new user is connected to a large enough component of the trust network.",
               "Using a trust network therefore improves the coverage of recommendations. However, when we go far from the source user u in the trust network, the trust between these users and the source user will become fairly weak and their ratings will be noisy and unreliable. Therefore, we have to use the ratings expressed by users in the neighborhood close to the user u. But, in this case the probability of finding a rating expressed on the item will be very low and we will not be able to compute a prediction.",
               "In order to consider enough ratings without suffering from noisy data, we propose a random walk method (TrustWalker) which combines trust-based and item-based recommendation. TrustWalker considers not only ratings of the target item, but also those of similar items. The probability of using the rating of a similar item instead of a rating for the target item increases with increasing length of the walk. Our framework contains both trust-based and item-based collaborative filtering recommendations as special cases. Most traditional recommender systems do not provide confidence in their predictions. The random walk model allows us to com-pute the confidence in our predictions. Also our system is able to explain and justify its results.",

The rating of user u on item i is denoted by r u,i . r u,i can be any real number, but often ratings are integers in the range . In a trust-based system, we also have a trust network among users. If u trusts v, then tu,v denotes the value of this trust as a real number in . Zero means no trust and one means full trust. Binary trust networks are the most common trust networks (Amazon 4 , eBay 5 , ...). We define T U u = {vU | t u,v = 1} where T Uu denotes the set of users directly trusted by u.",

The predicted rating is denoted by r u,i . Normally, users rate only a very small percentage of the items, and ru,i is unknown for most pairs of (u,i).",
               "Traditional recommenders estimate ru,i based on ratings expressed by similar users. Basically, they find a neighborhood of raters (users who have rated target item i) who have a rating profile similar to the source user, and aggregate their ratings. In trust-based recommenders, the trust network will be used instead of rating similarities to define the neighborhood. To predict a rating we ask our directly trusted neighbors whether they know the rating for the item. If so, they return it, otherwise they recursively ask their direct neighbors. The neighborhood in a trust based recommendation is defined as the set of raters trusted (directly or indirectly) by the source user. The ratings from these rates are aggregated to produce a recommendation.",
               "Trust-based recommendation works because of the effects of selection and social influence that have been postulated by sociologists for a long time. Selection means that people tend to relate to people with similar attributes, and due to social influence related people in a social network influence each other to become more similar . The increasing availability of online social network data has finally allowed a verification of these sociological models. experimentally verified that people are similar to their neighbors in a social network for these reasons. They had a network of people having social interactions and a similarity network in which users are connected to their most similar users. It was shown that the social interaction and similarity graphs have little overlap, sharing fewer than 15% of their edges. The results of and of similar work confirm that a social network provides an independent source of information which can be exploited to improve the quality of recommendations.",
               "Exploiting the trust network in recommenders does not necessarily enhance the precision of system, but it allows to compute the recommendation for more pairs of (u, i) which leads to better coverage. Coverage is the percentage of < user, item > pairs in the test set for which we can compute a recommendation. This information can in particular help to produce recommendations for cold start users. Moreover, using a trust network will protect the recommender system against attacks like fake profiles. As faked profiles are not being trusted, they can not affect the recommender. illustrates the trust-based recommendation prob- lem. As shown in this figure, we have a social (trust) network of users. Each user has rated some items. The source user u wants a prediction on the target item i (the green diamond). Normally just a few users have rated the target item. Other users have ratings on other items which may include items already rated by u or items similar to the target item i. The goal of the recommender is to predict unknown ratings based on the ratings expressed by trusted friends."

Explicit trust denotes the trust values explicitly indicated by users, while implicit trust is the trust value inferred from some evidence such as feature similarity of users or email exchange among two persons. In this paper we deal with the explicit trust indicated by users. In the case of explicit trust, we have direct trust and indirect trust. Direct trust is the trust value explicitly indicated by users, but indirect trust is the trust inferred from direct trust using transitivity of trust. how to compute indirect trust is one of the main issues of trust models. Two different approaches can be distinguished for trust computation: Model-basedand Memory-based. In Model-based approaches, a model with its parameters will be learnt to compute indirect trust. But, in Memory-based approaches, no model is being learnt and normally exploration and heuristics are being used.",

Basically, it finds all raters with the shortest path distance from the source user and aggregates their ratings weighted by the trust between the source user and these raters. To compute the trust value between user u and v who are not directly connected, TidalTrust aggregates the trust value between u's direct neighbors and v weighted by the direct trust values of u and its direct neighbors. Since TidalTrust only uses information from raters at the nearest distance, it may loose a lot of valuable ratings from users a little further apart in the network.",

But MoleTrust considers all raters up to a maximum-depth given as an input. maximumdepth is independent of any specific user and item. Also, to compute the trust value between u and v in MoleTrust, we perform a backward exploration. It means that the trust value from u to v is the aggregation of trust values between u and users directly trusting v weighted by the direct trust values.",

The input for Advogato is given by an integer number n, the number of members to trust. To assign capacities to the edges of the network, they need to transform the network, so it needs to know the whole structure of the network. Moreover, it only computes the nodes to trust and does not compute different degrees of trust. Since the number of users to trust is independent of users and items and there is no distinction between the trusted users, this approach is not appropriate for trustbased recommendation.",

Source node u is activated through an injection of energy e, which is then fully propagated to other nodes along edges proportional to the weight of the edge.

They extract the social network from the similarity of users' profiles, which is not providing additional information as is provided by trust network. They have two definitions for trust: profile level trust, which is a global reputation metric; and item level trust, which measures the trustworthiness of a user according to his recommendations for an item rather than a user-user local trust metric. They use the trust values to filter raters, and they aggregate the ratings weighted by a combination of trust and similarity values. Moreover, they do not use the transitivity of trust, but only directly trusted users. This method is not a trust-based recommendation method in the sense in which we use this term in this paper. their ratings become. Our approach to find a good trade-off is based on the following observation. Ratings expressed by strongly trusted friends on similar items are more reliable than ratings expressed by weakly trusted far neighbors on the exact target item.

Basically, our model consists of two major components: the random walk on the trust network and the probabilistic item selection. The random walk performs the search in the trust network, and the item selection part considers ratings on similar items to avoid going too deep in the network.

Collaborative filtering methods are rather vulnerable to attacks that insert fraudulent user profiles into the database.

In order to address this problem, we proposed the random walk model TrustWalker to combine the trust-based and the item-based collaborative filtering approach to recommendation. TrustWalker considers not only ratings of the target item, but also those of similar items, with probability increasing with increasing length of the walk. As another contribution, TrustWalker allows us to define and to measure the confidence of a recommendation. We performed an evaluation on the Epinions dataset, demonstrating that TrustWalker outperforms both collaborative filtering methods and purely trust-based methods specially in terms of coverage. Also TrustWalker has a slightly better precision compared to other Trust-based approaches while clearly outperforming Collaborative Filtering approaches in terms od precision. We also showed that highly confident recommendations are of even greater quality.",

Besides the problem of predicting a rating for a given item, recommending a list of items to a user is also a natural task for recommenders. We plan to investigate the extension of the TrustWalker model for this task. In this paper and in the related work, the ratings are assumed to be stored in a centralized repository. However, applications such as mobile phone-based social networks require a distributed recommender, and a random walk model is a promising approach for such scenarios. The trust concept we considered in this paper is context independent. However, people may trust other people in some context while they do not trust those people in other contexts. Investigating context-based trust models for recommendations is also an interesting direction for future work."
