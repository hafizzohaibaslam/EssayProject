               "The problem of influence maximization deals with choosing the optimal set of nodes in a social network so as to maximize the resulting spread of a technology (opinion, product-ownership, etc.), given a model of diffusion of influence in a network. A natural extension of this would be to introduce a competitive setting, in which the goal is to maximize the spread of our technology in the presence of one or more competitors. We suggest several natural extensions to the well-studied linear-threshold model that was used in the single-technology case, and show that the original greedy approach cannot be used. Furthermore, we show that for a broad family of competitive influence models, it is NP-hard to achieve an approximation that is better than a square root of the optimal solution. Also, we show that the same proof of hardness of approximation can also be applied to give a negative result for a conjecture in [2] about a general cascade model for competitive diffusion. Finally, we suggest a natural model that is amenable to the greedy approach."

               "The problem of influence maximization has long been the focus of study in social science (e.g. ). It has been formally defined and addressed in and as follows: given a social-network as a directed graph, and a prescribed number k, pick the k most \"influential\" nodes that will function as early adopters of a particular influence, so as to maximize the final number number of infected, or activated nodes (the two terms are used in this paper interchangeably), subject to a specified model of influence diffusion. This problem begs the natural extension of a competitive version: given the competitor's choice of early adopters of technology B, maximize the spread of technology A by choosing a set of early adopters such that the expected spread of technology A will be maximal. Indeed, this problem has been the subject of interest in subsequent papers ( , , ) which present competitive extensions for the independent cascade model presented in . In this paper we suggest a few natural extensions to a well-studied model that was also given in for the diffusion of social influence in a social network -the linear threshold model. Formally, an instance of the problem would be composed of a directed, edge-weighted graph G = (V, E), a set of technology B's initial adopters I B ? V , and an integer k. The computational problem is how to choose a set I A ? V ? I B of k nodes such that the expected number of A-active nodes at the end of the process,(I A , I B ), is maximized, given the specific model for competitive diffusion of technologies (when I B is known from context we omit it and simply write(I A )). It is important to note that all of the presented models can be motivated by natural processes. Our models reduce to the original linear threshold model formalized in whenever I B is the empty set. For simplicity of notation, the models presented are stated in terms of only two competing technologies. However, all of the models and results can be easily extended for when there are several competing technologies.",

First, notice the high ratio of the weight of the edge connecting the B-subtree to the weight of the subtree containing x. Also, notice that the initially B-active node is located higher relatively to initially A-active nodes (only x in the given simple example). These two properties increase the probability that the parent node (v in our case) will adopt technology B, much more, and much more quickly than the probability that it will adopt technology A. This in effect, contributes to the decrease in the probability that the higher node (r in our case) will adopt A. Another point, is that this example shows that in less pathological cases, a node's probability of becoming A-active may increase, but this increase may come at the expense of a much higher increase in the probability of becoming B-active. In other words, by A-activating certain nodes, actually the competitor will benefit the most.",
