               "We study a setting where a group of individuals (also called agents or users) are nodes of a social network G. In general, G is a directed graph and is generated from an unknown probability distribution. We are concerned with individuals performing a certain action for the first time, e.g., purchasing a product, visiting a web-page, or tagging a photo with a particular tag.",
               "1 After an agent performs the action, we say that the agent has become active. We observe Confounding. The second explanation for correlation between actions of adjacent agents in a social network is external influence from elements in the environment (also referred to as confounding factors), which are more likely to affect individuals that are located close to each other in the social network. Mathematically, this means that there is a confounding variable X, and both the network G and the set of active individuals W come from distributions correlated with X. For example, two individuals who live in the same city are more likely to become friends than two random individuals, and they are also more likely to take pictures of similar scenery and post them on Flickr with the same tag.",
               "Note that there is a fine distinction between this explanation and homophily: homophily refers to situations where the set W affects individuals' choices to become friends, while in confounding, both the choices of individuals to become friends and their choice to become active are affected by the same unobserved variable. It is possible to distinguish between these models by looking at the time where the edges of G are established. The focus of this paper, however, is on distinguishing social influence from other types of social correlation. Therefore, we study a common generalization of the confounding and the homophily model as follows: first, the pair (G, W ) is selected according to a joint probability distribution, and then the time of activation for individuals in W is picked i.i.d. according to a distribution T on . We call this model the correlation model. The main assumption here is that the probability that an individual is active can be affected by whether their friends become active, but not by when they become active. This is in contrast with the influence model, as defined below.",
               "1 In many cases, e.g., purchasing certain products or using certain tags, an individual might perform the action multiple times. We focus on the first time the action is performed by each individual, since subsequent occurrences of the same action by the same individual is often more dependent on the first occurrence than on the social network.",
               "Influence. The third, and perhaps the most consequential explanation for social correlation is social influence. This refers to the phenomenon that the action of individuals can induce their friends to act in a similar way. This can be through setting an example for their friends (as in the case of fashion), informing them about the action (as in the case of viral marketing), or increasing the value of an action for them (as in the case of adoption of a technology). Mathematically, this can be modeled as follows: first, the graph G is drawn according to some distribution. Then, in each of the time steps 1, . . . , T , each non-active agent decides whether to become active. The probability of becoming active for each agent u is a function p(x) of the number x of other agents v that have an edge to u and are already active.",

The second instance constructed above only permutes all time stamps, and hence the new t i 's are still i.i.d. from the same distribution T . Therefore, the two instances come from the exact same distribution, and hence they should lead to the same expected social correlation coefficient. The only thing that remains to be proven is that this coefficient is concentrated around its expectation (where the expectation is taken over the random choice of the time stamps, conditioning on a fixed choice of G and W ). In the next section, we formalize this intuition, leading to Theorem 1."

We demonstrate this fact with a simple example. Consider a line graph with n + 1 nodes, v0, v1, v2, . . . , vn, and edge set the {(vi, vi+1); i = 0, 2, . . . , n ? 1}. For simplicity we assume that that node v0 is has initially used a tag; this does not change the nature of our example.

Since other forms of social correlation (other than social influence) are only based on the fact that two friends often share common characteristics or are affected by the same external variables and are independent of which of these two individuals has named the other as a friend, we intuitively expect reversing the edges not to change our estimate of the social correlation significantly. On the other hand, social influence spreads in the direction specified by the edges of the graph, and hence reversing the edges should intuitively change the estimate of the correlation. We will test this hypothesis on several classes of instances generated using probabilistic models of different forms of social correlation. To verify the validity of the techniques described in Section 3, we define three generative models one corresponding to a setting where there is no social correlation, one corresponding to a setting that there is only social influence and one that there is social correlation but not influence.

Then we show that there is positive correlation in the users' behavior. Finally, we address the issue of the source of correlation. We apply the tests of Section 3, and we conclude that influence is not a likely source of the correlation. We analyzed the tagging behavior of users for a period of 16 months. The final number of users was about 800K. Since the majority of users did not exhibit any tagging behavior at all, we restricted our attention to the set of users who have tagged any photo with any tag, which is about 340K users. Looking at this subgraph at the end of the 16-month period, the size of the giant component is 160K users, the second one has size 16, and there are 165K isolated users."

A lot of users used the misspelled tag \"grafitti.\" Here the difference turns out to be slightly larger (still small though). It is easy to imagine that indeed there is some propagation of the misspelled version. (The analogy with the TA who grades two homeworks with the same mistakes should make this concept clear!) Finally, with a third, even less common spelling (\"graffitti\"), the difference increased yet more. marketing technologies to shape the future of marketing on the Internet, this and many other related questions are of tremendous practical value."

This is an instance of the age-old problem of distinguishing correlation from causation. This problem is very difficult in general; however, in our case, we used the availability of data about the time-step of each action, as well as asymmetric social ties between the agents in order to study this problem.",

First, our techniques provide only a qualitative indication of the existence of influence and not a quantitative measure. Furthermore, we do not provide any formal verification of our results. For example, is it indeed the case that in Flickr users' tagging behavior, influence has a limited role? Or, can we pinpoint social networks and behaviors where influence is indeed prevalent and verify our tests? Also, what happens when different sources of social correlation are present, as is usually the case? All these important questions might be tricky to answer and probably require the design of controlled user experiments. Furthermore, it would be very interesting to extend our theoretical model for distinguishing between social influence and other forms of correlation in social networks. Under what conditions the information about the time step of events is enough to achieve this goal? How can the pattern of the \"spread\" of an action be used to identify social influence even in a setting where all social ties are symmetric? How can we find an \"influential\" node just by looking at the data about the spread of an action? Given the great potential of viral"
