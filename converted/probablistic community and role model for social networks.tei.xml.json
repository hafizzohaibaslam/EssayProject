               "Numerous models have been proposed for modeling social networks to explore their structure or to address application problems, such as community detection and behavior prediction. However, the results are still far from satisfactory. One of the biggest challenges is how to capture all the information of a social network such as links, communities, user attributes, roles and behaviors, in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose a unified probabilistic framework , the Community Role Model (CRM), to model a social network. CRM incorporates all the information of nodes and edges that form a social network. We propose methods based on Gibbs sampling and an EM algorithm to estimate model parameters and fit our model to real social networks. Real data experiments show that CRM can be used not only to represent a social network, but also to handle various application problems with better performance than a baseline model, without any modification to the model."

We can use a graph to model the structure of a social network, where nodes and edges represent users and interactions, which are visible elements.

For example, in a social network, nodes may have closer relationships within a community than across communities. Nodes may have different attributes-for example, some nodes may be popular, and have many followers, but others may be different. Nodes may exhibit different behaviors-for example, some nodes seem very active, and repost messages or comment on pictures, while others may not. However, according to , people's behaviors not only depend on their own attributes, but also on the influence of their neighbors and communities. How should we model a complex social network so that the model can capture the intrinsic relations between all these elements, such as conformity influence, individual attributes, and actions? How do we use a social network model to handle issues such as community detection and behavior prediction?",

Thus we can assume that each node has a distribution over the communities-i.e., that different nodes may be located in different communities. A node in a specific community may have a unique probability to link to another node.

For example, some nodes may have higher in-degree, and play the role of opinion leader , while others may have higher out-degree, and tend to transfer messages across communities, playing the role of structural hole spanner . The attributes of each role satisfy a specific distribution-such as a Gaussian distribution. Each node has a distribution over roles according to its attributes.",

Most nodes tend to take similar actions with nodes in the same community; in other words, whether a node takes a specific action partly depends on the community it belongs to. Moreover, whether a node takes an action may also depend on the role it plays. For example, according to , 25% of information diffusion is controlled by 1% of nodes serving the role of structural hole spanners. Thus, when we predict the action that a node might take, we must consider the distributions that the node has over both communities and roles."

CRM achieves much better performance in Weibo since it takes both communities and personal attributes into consideration, while other methods only take individual attributes into consideration.

In that model, the probability that two nodes have a link is proportional to the product of the values of the two nodes. proposes a model in which, when adding a node to an existing graph, selecting an existing node randomly and adding links with its neighbors with certain probabilities yields a model. adopts a mechanism that not only adds but also deletes nodes when generating a network. introduces dress various practical problems without any change to the model itself, showing its superiority.

               "Behavior prediction. This work was first conducted by economists in the 1890s. Recently, many computer scientists have been working on this topic in the social network context. conducts a famous experiment indicating that one's voting choices are susceptible to those of his/her friends. predicts user behaviors with influence from his/her friends and communities. However, neither takes personal behavior patterns into consideration. analyzes retweeting behavior in Twitter, and proposes a factor graph model to predict retweeting behavior. leverages knowledge of user behavior in different networks to alleviate the data sparsity problem and enhance the predictive performance of user modeling. analyzes click stream data and reveals key features of social network workloads, such as how frequently people connect to social networks and for how long, as well as the types and sequences of activities that users conduct on social networks.",
               "studies the reposting actions of users in social networks. This paper classifies users into three rolesopinion leader, structural hole spanner, and ordinary user, which have different behavior patterns. Whether a user reposts a message greatly depends on the role it plays.",
               "Community detection. Since the concept of community was raised formally, various methods to detect community have been proposed. Due to space limitations, we do not list them here. With the proliferation of community detection methods, evaluating them has become a hot topic. Modularity is a kind of measure to evaluate community detection algorithms through comparing edge densities. regards community quality as a function of its size, and offers a more-refined lens to examine community detection methods.
