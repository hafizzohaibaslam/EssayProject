We show that the large connectivity fluctuations usually found in these networks strengthen considerably the incidence of epidemic outbreaks. Scale-free networks, which are characterized by diverging connectivity fluctuations in the limit of a very large number of nodes, exhibit the lack of an epidemic threshold and always show a finite fraction of infected individuals. This particular weakness, observed also in models without immunity, defines a new epidemiological framework characterized by a highly heterogeneous response of the system to the introduction of infected individuals with different connectivity.

               "The epidemiology of heterogeneous networks has largely benefited from the need of understanding the spreading of human sexual diseases in the complex web of sexual partnership . Epidemic modeling considered that population groups can be characterized in classes having different sexual activity or number of sexual contacts. This fact leads to models dealing with heterogeneous populations which are known to enhance the spread of infections as well as make them harder to eradicate (for a review see ). In this perspective, a limiting case is represented by the newly identified classes of complex networks (for a review see ). The highly heterogeneous topology of these networks is mainly reflected in the small average path lengths among any two nodes (small-world property) , and in a power law distribution (scalefree property), P (k) ? k ?2?, for the probability that any node has k connections to other nodes . While regular networks present finite connectivity fluctuations (k k 2 ), scale-free (SF) networks are a limiting case of heterogeneity where connectivity fluctuations are diverging if 0 <1. In other words, the network nodes possess a statistically significant probability of having a virtually unbounded number of connections compared to the average value. SF networks find real examples in several technological systems such as the Internet and the world-wide-web (WWW) , as well as in natural systems such as food-webs, and metabolic or protein networks . The need to understand the dynamics of information transmission, the error tolerance , and other properties of complex networks has therefore called for the study of epidemic modeling in complex networks .",
               "A surprising result, originated by the inspection of the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model, has shown that the spread of infections is tremendously strengthened on SF networks . Opposite to standard models, epidemic processes in these networks do not possess, in the limit of an infinite network, any epidemic threshold below which the infection cannot produce a major epidemic outbreak or an endemic state. In principle, SF networks are prone to the persistence of diseases whatever infective strength they may have. This feature reverberates also in the choice of immunization strategies and changes radically many standard conclusions on epidemic spreading. This study appears particularly relevant in the case of technological networks, for instance for the spreading of digital viruses in the Internet , and it has soon been generalized by showing that also the susceptible-infectedremoved (SIR) model shows the same absence of epidemic threshold . These results highlight the study of epidemic models in complex networks as potentially relevant also in human and animal epidemiology , as confirmed recently by the experimental observation that the web architecture of sexual contacts is best described by a scalefree topology in which individuals have widely different connectivities .",
               "In this paper we provide a detailed analytical and numerical study of the SIR model on two prototype complex networks: the Watts-Strogatz (WS) model and the Barabsi-Albert (BA) model. The first model is a smallworld network with bounded connectivity fluctuations, while the second one is the prototype example of SF network. The analytical approach allows us to recover the total size of the epidemics in an infinite population, in agreement with earlier estimates . We are able to find the analytic expression for the critical threshold as a function of the moments of the connectivity distribution and we confirm the absence of any finite threshold for connectivity distributions P (k) ? k ?2?with 0 <1, in the infinite size limit. We obtain the general analytic expression for the total density of infected individuals and the epidemic threshold at arbitraryvalues. Finite size network effects can be easily evaluated from the analytic expressions. Time evolution and other effects of heterogeneity such as the relative infection incidence in different connectivity classes can be predicted. In order to confirm the analytical findings we perform large scale numerical simulations on the WS and BA networks. Numerical results are in perfect agreement with the analytical predictions and confirm that the interplay of complex networks topology and epidemic modeling leads to a new and interesting theoretical framework, whose predictions and implications need to be exhaustively explored.",

In this framework, diseases which result in the immunization or death of infected individuals can be characterized by the classical susceptible-infectedremoved (SIR) model . In this model individuals can only exist in three different states: susceptible (healthy), infected, or removed (immunized or dead). In a homogeneous system, the SIR model can be described in terms of the densities of susceptible, infected, and removed individuals, S(t),(t), and R(t), respectively, as a function of time. These three magnitudes are linked through the normalization condition",

The homogeneous mixing hypothesis is indeed equivalent to a mean-field treatment of the model, in which one assumes that the rate of contacts between infectious and susceptibles is constant, and independent of any possible source of heterogeneity present in the system. Another implicit assumption of this model is that the time scale of the disease is much smaller than the lifespan of individuals; therefore we do not include in the equations terms accounting for the birth or natural death of individuals. The most significant prediction of this model is the presence of a nonzero epidemic thresholdc . If the value ofis abovec ,>c , the disease spreads and infects a finite fraction of the population. On the other hand, whenis below the threshold,<c , the total number of infected individuals (the epidemic prevalence), R= lim tR(t), is infinitesimally small in the limit of very large populations (the thermodynamic limit). In order to see this point, let us consider the set of equations (2), in which, without lack of generality, we set ? = 1.

On the other hand, the WS model has also a local structure (clustering property) that is not found in random graphs with finite connectivity . The WS graph is defined as follows : The starting point is a ring with N nodes, in which each node is symmetrically connected with its 2m nearest neighbors. Then, for every node each link connected to a clockwise neighbor is rewired to a randomly chosen node with probability p, and preserved with probability 1 ? p. This procedure generates a random graph with a connectivity distributed exponentially for large k , and an average connectivity k = 2m. The graph has small-world properties and a non-trivial \"clustering coefficient\"; i.e., neighboring nodes share many common neighbors .

               "The presented results for the SIR model in complex networks confirm the epidemiological picture proposed in previous works. The topology of the network has a great influence in the overall behavior of epidemic spreading. The connectivity fluctuations of the network play a major role by strongly enhancing the infection's incidence. This issue assumes a particular relevance in the case of SF networks that exhibit connectivity fluctuations diverging with the increasing size N of the web. SF networks are therefore very weak in face of infections presenting an effective epidemic threshold that is vanishing in the limit N. In the case of the SIR model in an infinite population this corresponds to the absence of any epidemic threshold below which major epidemic outbreaks are impossible. These results strengthen the epidemiological framework for complex networks reported for the SIS model and proposed as well for the SIR model . In both models the heterogeneous connectivity allows certain regions of the network to be always in the active phase, thus shifting to zero the epidemic threshold and inducing the same functional form of the order parameter. The emerging picture is likely going to stimulate the re-analysis of several concepts of standard epidemiology such as the \"core group\" or the characteristic number of contacts that appears to be ill-defined in SF networks. The high heterogeneity of SF networks finds signatures also in the peculiar susceptibility to infections starting on the most connected individuals and the different relative incidence within populations of varying connectivity k. It is reasonable to expect that these features can point at better protection methods for these networks which appear to have practical realization in many technological and biological systems. In this perspective, the introductions of many elements of realism and a better knowledge of the networks temporal pattern are fundamental ingredients towards a better understanding of the spreading of information and epidemics in a wide range of complex interacting systems.
