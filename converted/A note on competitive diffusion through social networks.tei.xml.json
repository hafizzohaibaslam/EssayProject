We study the relation between the diameter of the network and the existence of pure Nash equilibria in the game. In particular, we show that if the diameter is at most two then an equilibrium exists and can be found in polynomial time, whereas if the diameter is greater than two then an equilibrium is not guaranteed to exist."

               "Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter are modern focal points of human interaction. The pursuit of insights into the nature of this interaction calls for a game-theoretic analysis. Indeed, a number of papers (see, e.g., ) investigate variations on the following setting. The social network is represented by an undirected graph, where the vertices are users and edges connect users who are in a social relationship. Suppose, for example, that there are several competing applications, e.g., voice over IP systems, that are not interoperable. The users play a coordination game, where if two neighbors adopt the same system they get some reward that is based on the inher-ent quality of the system. The goal is to study the diffusion of technologies through the social network. The point of view here is completely decentralized, and the players in the game are the users of the social network.",
               "We propose a different, global point of view regarding the incentives that govern the diffusion process. Suppose we have several firms that would like to advertise competing products via \"viral marketing\". Each firm initially targets a small subset of users, in the hope that the rumor about its product would spread throughout the network. However, a user that adopts one product is reluctant to adopt another, hence the campaign of one firm negatively affects the success of another firm's campaign. To the best of our knowledge our model is the first game-theoretic model to deal with the incentives of interested parties outside the social network. Note that some previous papers did consider the problem of choosing an influential set of users as an optimization problem (see, e.g., ), but not in a competitive game-theoretic setting. Other papers, which deal with Voronoi games on graphs, provide a game-theoretic study of a static facility location problem where each vertex is assigned to the closest agent and the utility of an agent is the number of vertices assigned to it (see, e.g., ). In our model, in contrast, vertices are where x iV is the initial vertex selected by agent i. We also denote",

There are n + 2 colors: a color for each agent iN, as well as two additional colors: white and gray. Initially, at time 1, some of the vertices are colored in the colors of N, while the others are white. At time t + 1 each white vertex that has neighbors colored in color i, but does not have neighbors colored in color j for any jN \\ {i}, is colored in color i. diameter at most two.
