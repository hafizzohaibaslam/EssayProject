               "Link prediction and recommendation is a fundamental problem in social network analysis. The key challenge of link prediction comes from the sparsity of networks due to the strong disproportion of links that they have potential to form to links that do form. Most previous work tries to solve the problem in single network, few research focus on capturing the general principles of link formation across heterogeneous networks. In this work, we give a formal definition of link recommendation across heterogeneous networks. Then we propose a ranking factor graph model (RFG) for predicting links in social networks, which effectively improves the predictive performance. Motivated by the intuition that people make friends in different networks with similar principles, we find several social patterns that are general across heterogeneous networks. With the general social patterns, we develop a transfer-based RFG model that combines them with network structure information. This model provides us insight into fundamental principles that drive the link formation and network evolution. Finally, we verify the predictive performance of the presented transfer model on 12 pairs of transfer cases. Our experimental results demonstrate that the transfer of general social patterns indeed help the prediction of links."

Thus, the study and modeling of the dynamics in the network structure are important and a center of focus of a number of papers , , , .",
               "In this paper, we consider the process of link formation as a tenet behind network growth and evolution. That is, given nodes in a network, the network grows by forming new relationships among the existing nodes. This has a variety of applications including biology, medicine, and social networks. In this paper, we focus on social networks, considering the question of which individuals will form connections with each other. This is the problem of link prediction or recommendation, which can be defined as the task of predicting whether a link will form between two nodes in the future. However, how such social networks evolve at the level of individual links is still not well understood , and forms the main motivation for our work.",
               "Another motivation for this work comes from the major challenge of the link prediction problem which results from the sparsity of real social networks , , which means that the existing links between nodes are only a very small fraction of all potential links in the network. To solve the strongly unbalanced data between negative instances and positive instances, the authors of undersampled the holdout test set to balance and the authors of also contribute only a sample of the negative instances to their test set. However, this sample changes the data distribution which no longer presents the same challenges at the realworld distribution. This makes the prediction performance is uninterpretable, because it no longer reflects the real capabilities and limitations of the prediction model .",

What are the intrinsic mechanisms by which link forms and structure evolves in different social networks? To which extent can we use the general patterns to model the link formation and network evolution? These questions reveal the interacting human behaviors that underlie the fundamental patterns of social activities. The solution to this problem could help shape and improve our understanding of human behaviors and social networks.",

Clearly, the likelihood of two users creating a link increases when the number of their common neighbors increases in the four networks. This effect of homophily is more pronounced when the number reaches 100, where the probabilities are all higher than 50% in the four networks. It is worth noting that the probability of reciprocal relations in Twitter network increases more sharply than in the other networks in .",

               "In this section, we will first describe how we generate candidate relationships and then introduce several baseline predictors. Candidate Generation. In this work, we try to recommend friends for users. To construct the data, we first randomly selected 2,000 nodes as the source users from the network. For each source user, we generate the candidate list for her/him. Specifically, for a given user v s , there are in total (|V | ? d(v s )) potential links except her/his existing friends. Here, we choose the 2-hop neighborhood as v s 's potential friends. There are two reasons that we focus on predicting links in the distance of 2-hop. First, there is empirically hard to believe that the benefit of successfully predicting links to nodes at high n-hop neighbors is greater than the benefit of predicting them at low n-hop neighbors . More than half of all links close triangles at the time of creation, i.e., a person connects to a friend of her/his friend . Second, the number of potential candidates grows exponentially (d(v s ) n?1 ) as the number of hops n increases. For example, in Epinions, if set n=3, then only 0.6% of the candidate relationships will finally be created. Baseline Predictors. Straightforwardly, we can consider an unsupervised method. In , the authors reviewed several typical unsupervised methods for link prediction and found that the common neighbors (CN) method, Adamic/Adar (AA) measure and Jaccard (JA) index have better performance in most cases. Here we consider the three methods as the basic predictors. In addition, we also define another predictor using the Preferential Attachment (PA) index. All four methods use the principle of homophily (similarity) to make predictions.",

SVMRank uses the local attributes associated with each link or node as features to train a classification model and then apply it to rank the potential nodes in the test data. Here, we use SVM-light. LRC uses the same local attributes to train a logistic regression classification model. As for features in the supervised models, we use the same attributes as those on our proposed model (Cf. II). networks can be fitted to power-law distributions, including trust relations in Epinions, friendships in Slashdot, vote relations in WikiVote and reciprocity in the Twitter following network.

To test whether social balance can help recommendation across heterogeneous networks, we examine how the four different networks satisfy this theory. shows the probabilities of balanced triads based on positive links and all links.

We try to examine the close triad formation with different types of users in it. (a) enumerates six cases of the process of triad formation. We examine the probabilities that two users (Y and Z) have a link, conditioned on whether user X, Y, Z are elite users. There exists some interesting patterns we have found. First, the probabilities of each of the six cases forming a close triad are very distinct. In (b), take Epinions network as an example. Conditioned on whether Y and Z are elite users, the probability of Y and Z have a link in case (A/B) (both elite users) is higher (2 to 5 times) than that in (C/D) (either), much higher (10 to 20 times) than that in (E/F) (none). Users Y and Z are more likely (2 to 10 times) to have a link if X is an elite user (A/C/E) than if X is not (B/D/F).

In general, we note that the supervised methods achieve better prediction results than unsupervised ones in terms of both AU C and P re@30, and basically, the AU C values have positive relevance with P re@30. In and IV, it can be clearly seen that our proposed RFG model significantly outperforms both supervised and unsupervised comparison methods. In terms of AU C, RFG achieves a 10-30% improvement compared with the unsupervised methods and SVMRank. Especially in Slashdot, the performance of RFG reaches about 2 times of unsupervised methods. Comparing with LRC method, RFG also gets an improvement of 4-9%. For precision at top 30, there is a slight improvement by RFG to other methods. RFG achieves a better performance than other methods, about 200% relative improvement compared with unsupervised methods in Epinions and Wikivote. In Slashdot, there is a more surprising good performance by RFG. More than 10 out of 30 positive relations we recommend are right in cases of Slashdot and Wikivote. One of the reasons that our RFG has better performance is that it considers some implicit social patterns, namely social balance and close triad formation."

We now describe the transfer power of link recommendation on 12 pairs of networks: Slashdot/Wikivote/Twitter as source network to Epinions as target network, Epinions/Wikivote/Twitter (S) to Slashdot (T), Epinions/Slashdot/Twitter (S) to Wikivote (T), Epinions /Slashdot/Wikivote (S) to Twitter (T). In all experiments, the number of positive instances in the source network is set to 50% n (n is the number of negative instances in target network) and the number of source negative instances is equal to 50% target positive instances. shows the recommendation results on 12 transfer cases. We can see that TRFG with information transfer from source networks outperforms the RFG without transfer in most cases. With Epinions, the transfer from all three other networks: Slashdot, Wikivote, Twitter benefits the recommendation performance evaluated by both AU C and P re@30 metrics. With Slashdot, only the transfer from Epinions improves the predictive power. We also note that all the transfers from Epinions or Slashdot have a more powerful prediction than RFG. With Twitter, TRFG has a slight advantage over RFG.",
               "Although TRFG outperforms RFG in most cases by leveraging the supervised information from source networks, it is worth noting that the transfer seems unhelpful especially for the cases from Twitter or Wikivote network. By a careful consideration, we notice that the degree distributions of Twitter and Wikivote networks does not fully fit the degree distribution like Epinions and Slashdot in . There indeed exist some similar patterns over different networks, but the generality of them is sometimes limited. Transfer efficiency analysis. Here we try to test how the scale of source networks can affect the prediction performance. shows the performance of link recommendation with transfer by varying the percent of source instances to target instances. In general, it shows that the prediction performance decreases as the percent increases, which is contrary to our intuition that more source instances could help solve the imbalance problem in target data. The reason for it is interpretable. Although the social patterns across heterogeneous networks are general, the original distribution of the target network varies to some certain extent with more and more source instances, which may indeed help decrease the imbalance ratio between negative and positive instances. Therefore, to what extent we can leverage the information transferred from source networks depends on the specific pairs of networks. For example, with increasing instances in source networks, the performance from Slashdot to Epinions improves. In contrast, performance decreases when transfer from Wikivote or Twitter networks."

               "Link Prediction. Link prediction has attracted considerable attention in recent years from both the computer science and physics community. Existing work can be classified into two categories: unsupervised methods and supervised methods. Most unsupervised link prediction algorithms are based on the similarity measure between nodes of a graph. A seminal work by Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg for unsupervised methods addresses the problem from an algorithmic point of view, investigating how different proximity features can be exploited to predict the occurrence of new links in social networks . More recently, researchers have advocated supervised approaches for link prediction. proposes a partially labeled factor graph for learning to predict the type of social relationships in large networks. further extends this work to heterogeneous networks by leveraging social theories as the bridge to connect different networks. In , Wang et. al. introduce a local probabilistic graphical model that can scale to large graphs to estimate the joint co-occurrence probability of two nodes. presents a unified framework for learning link prediction and edge weight prediction functions in large networks, based on the transformation of a graph's algebraic spectrum. In , , Lichtenwalter et al. motivate the use of a binary classification framework and vertex collocation profiles through a careful investigation of many factors. In , a supervised random walk is designed for link prediction and recommendation in Facebook. The main difference between traditional work on link prediction and our direction lies in that existing work mainly focuses on specific networks, while we try to exploit the general social patterns across heterogeneous networks and incorporate them into a transfer-based ranking factor graph model. Social Behavior Analysis. Our work is also related with social behavior analysis, because we try employ the general human behaviors in online social networks. Barabsi et al.",
               ", , take a lot of work to understand individual human behavior patterns, model the scaling properties of human sociality and study structure, social ties and predictability in communication networks. Eagle et al. have considered how interactions between people over mobile communication can accurately predict relations among them. The authors of investigate how social actions evolve in a dynamic social network and propose a time-varying",
               "Transfer Learning. Another type of related work is transfer learning, which aims to transfer knowledge from a source domain to a related target domain. Two main issues in transfer learning are \"what to transfer\" and \"when to transfer\" . Many approaches have been proposed by selecting instances from the source domain for reusage in the target domain , . There is a lot of work conducted to transfer features between different domains. For example, Argyriou and Evgeniou propose a method to learn a shared low-dimensional representation for multiple related tasks. In recent years, there is some work about transferring knowledge across heterogeneous feature spaces . For example, Argyriou et al. propose an algorithm for classification in a heterogeneous environment. Compared with existing work, the networks studied in our problem are quite different and may not even have any overlapping attribute features, while most existing works only consider homogeneous networks. Also, we combine general social features into a transfer learning framework, while existing methods are mainly concerned with how to find shared attributes across different domains."

Then we propose a ranking factor graph (RFG) model for traditional link prediction and a transfer-based RFG (TRFG) for the novel link-recommendation problem across heterogeneous networks. At the micro-level, we find several general social patterns over different online social networks. We combine the discovered general social patterns into TRFG, which is used to transfer supervised information from the source network to help predict and recommend links in the target network. Experimental results in both cases show that our presented models can significantly improve the predictive performance by comparing them with several baseline methods.",
               "Although the scale of online social networks is growing at an exponential rate, the microscopic mechanism of link formation is still largely unexplored. Exploring the general social patterns of link formation could help us understand human interactions better. There are many potential future directions of this work. First, other general social patterns can be further explored. Another idea is to apply the proposed methodologies to other social networks to further validate its effectiveness."
