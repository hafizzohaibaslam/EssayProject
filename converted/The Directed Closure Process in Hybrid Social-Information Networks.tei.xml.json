               "A C A C It has often been taken as a working assumption that directed links in information networks are frequently formed by \"short-cutting\" a two-step path between the source and the destination-a kind of implicit \"link copying\" analogous to the process of triadic closure in social networks. Despite the role of this assumption in theoretical models such as preferential attachment, it has received very little direct empirical investigation. Here we develop a formalization and methodology for studying this type of directed closure process, and we provide evidence for its important role in the formation of links on Twitter. We then analyze a sequence of models designed to capture the structural phenomena related to directed closure that we observe in the Twitter data."

               "Information networks, which connect Web pages or other units of information, and social networks, which connect people, are related notions, but they exhibit fundamental differences. Two of the principal differences are based on directionality and heterogeneity. First, information networks are generally directed structures, with links created by one author to point to another; social networks, on the other hand, tend to be represented in most basic settings as undirected structures, expressing relationships that are approximately mutual. Second, information networks tend to contain a few nodes with extremely large numbers of incoming edges -documents or pages that are \"famous\" and hence widely referenced --while social networks exhibit disparities in connectivity only to a smaller extent, since even the most gregarious people have some practical limit on the number of genuine social ties they can form.",
               "The link structure of the Web, and of well-defined subsets of the Web such as the blogosphere and Wikipedia, are clear examples of information networks; social-networking sites such as Facebook have provided us with very large representations of social networks that are derived from social structure in the off-line world. An interesting recent development has been the growth of social media sites that increasingly interpolate between the properties of information networks and social networks. The micro-blogging site Twitter is a compelling example of such an interpolation. A user on Twitter is able to create links to other users whose content he or she is interested in; this is referred to as following these users, and the set of all such follower relations defines a network. The structure of this network reflects properties both of a social network, since it exposes underlying friendship relations among people, and also of an information network, since it is directed and also contains huge concentrations of links to specific \"celebrities\" and automated generators of news content that reflect fundamentally informational relations.

MacArthur Foundation.",
               "Link Formation in Information Networks. In a social network, triadic closure is one of the fundamental processes of link formation: there is an increased chance that a friendship will form between two people if they already have a friend in common . (For example, we could imagine the A-C friendship in as forming after the existence of the A-B and B-C edges, and accelerated by the existence of these two edges.) Recent empirical analysis has quantified this effect on large social network datasets ). Is there Figure 2: In this example, the edge from A to C exhibits closure if there is already a two-step path from A to C (i.e., through B 1 , B 2 , B 3 ) when the A-C edge arrives.",
               "an analogous process in information networks? A natural hypothesis for such a process is the following: if a node A in an information network links to B, and B links to C, then one should arguably expect an increased likelihood that A will link to C -since the author of A has an increased ability to become aware of C via the two-step path through B. (See .) We will refer to this as the directed closure process. In addition to its intuitive appeal, this process contains an implicit hypothesis about how links are formed in information networks -through the \"copying\" of a link from something you already point to -and such copying mechanisms form a crucial part of the motivation for the fundamental notion of preferential attachment . Despite the importance of the notion, however, there has been remarkably little empirical analysis of the extent to which this type of directed closure is truly at work in real information networks, and of the effects it may have on network structure.",
               "The Present Work: The Directed Closure Process. In this paper, we analyze the directed closure process using data from Twitter: we provide some of the first evidence on large information networks that directed closure is taking place at a rate significantly above what would be expected by chance; we identify a surprising level of heterogeneity in how strongly it operates across different parts of the network; and we analyze models that capture these effects.",
               "An important difference between triadic closure in social networks and directed closure in information networks is the following observation, which in a sense serves as the starting point for our analysis: while the extent of triadic closure can be assessed from a single snapshot of an undirected graph, the evaluation of directed closure inherently requires some form of temporal sequence information. Indeed, when we see an undirected triangle such as the one in , we know that whichever edge formed last will complete a twostep path consisting of the earlier two edges, and hence will satisfy the definition of triadic closure. On the other hand, the structure in (b) satisfies the definition of directed closure only if the A-C edge formed after the other two.",
               "This means that the amount of directed closure in a directed graph depends not just on the graph's structure, but also on the order in which edges arrive. Because of this we are able to develop a natural randomization test to evaluate whether directed closure is taking place in a given network at a rate above chance. Specifically, we say that an edge in a directed graph exhibits closure if, at the time it forms, it completes a directed two-step path between its endpoints. For example, in , the A-C edge exhibits closure if and only if it arrives after the pair of edges in one of the three possible two-step A-C paths through B 1 , B 2 , or B 3 . For a given network, we can thus ask: how many edges exhibit closure, and how many would have exhibited closure (in expectation) if the edges had arrived in a random order? The point is that in any arrival order of the edges, some number of the edges will close directed triangles; but if directed closure is a significant effect, then we may expect to see a larger number of such triangle-closings compared to what we'd see under a random arrival order.",
               "To investigate this empirically, we choose a random sample of micro-celebrities on Twitter, which we define to be users with between 10,000 and 50,000 followers. (We will abbreviate the term as ?-celebrity.) For each such ?-celebrity C, we determine the number of edges to C that exhibit closure, and compare it to the expected number of edges to C that would exhibit closure in a random ordering -we will refer to this latter number as the random-ordering baseline. Given that we are studying the followers of users with high numbers of in-links, one would conjecture that there are two competing forces at work. In one direction is the intuitively natural tendency of directed closure to create short-cuts in the presence of two-step paths. In the other direction, however, is the plausible tendency for people to link first to celebrities, before they link to more obscure users; that is, it is not clear that closure processes are necessary in order for people to discover and link to very prominent users. This latter effect would tend to cause triangles as in (b) to appear with the A-C and B-C edges first, reducing the extent of directed closure in the real data.",
               "We find in the Twitter data that the number of edges to a ?-celebrity that exhibit closure is higher than the randomordering baseline, indicating that even in linking to celebrities, there is an above-chance tendency to do this by closing an existing two-step path. This finding suggests a range of further interesting questions -specifically, whether the high rate of directed closure is due to overt copying of follower lists (as in the intuitive basis for the definition), or due to more subtle, implicit mechanisms that produce copying behavior at a macroscopic level. To address this question, as we discuss below, we consider the extent to which directed closure can arise even in models that do not explicitly build in copying as a mechanism."

               "Structure. Given the prevalence of directed closure in the Twitter network, one might suppose that it operates according to a relatively uniform underlying mechanism. But what we find, surprisingly, is significant heterogeneity in the amount of directed closure. We define the closure ratio of a ?-celebrity C to be the fraction of C's incoming edges that exhibit closure. If we track the closure ratio of C as edges to C are added in their temporal order, we find that the ratio stabilizes to an approximately constant value fairly early. However, the value to which the closure ratio stabilizes varies considerably from one ?-celebrity to another, and is not closely related to the number of followers. Thus, the closure ratio appears to be an intrinsic and diverse property of users with large numbers of followers: some such users receive a clear majority of their incoming links via the closing of a directed triangle, while others receive a much smaller proportion of their links this way.",
               "The cause of this is at some level a mystery, but to get a better understanding we look at the predictions of some basic network formation models. We present a heuristic calculation based on the preferential attachment model, suggesting that a user's closure ratio should be related to the sum of the in-degrees of the user's followers, and we find on the Twitter data that the closure ratio indeed follows this quantity more closely than simpler quantities such as the user's own number of followers. However, preferential attachment is not able to explain either the diversity of different closure ratios, or the fact that they can be large on nodes of small in-degree; to understand these effects better, we analyze more complex models that do not incorporate copying as an overt or explicit mechanism in link formation, including preferential attachment with fitness and a version of preferential attachment with embedded community structure which is related to a model of .",
               "We also note that the closure ratio of a user is distinct from -and exhibits qualitatively different properties than -the clustering coefficient ( . The clustering coefficient is the fraction of pairs in a node's neighborhood that are directly linked, and in the neighborhood of a high-degree node it is almost always a small quantity, for the fundamental reason that most of a high-degree node's neighbors don't have enough incident edges to produce a significant clustering coefficient ). The closure ratio, on the other hand, is a quantity that can be quite large even for the neighborhoods of nodes with extremely large degrees."

Our models in the subsequent sections will help us investigate this phenomenon. We now use the randomization test described in the introduction to identify evidence for the directed closure process at work. We take the subgraph induced on the nodes in {C}L in (C), and we insert the edges in an order selected uniformly at random from among all permutations of the edges.",

Let S k (C) denote the set of all users who are k-linked to C, and let f k denote the fraction of users in S k (C) whose edge to C exhibits closure. Now, for each k with |S k | > 10, we approximate the expected value of f k under the assumption that the order in which the edges are created is chosen uniformly at random. To do this, we run a simulation in which we generate a network consisting simply of a node A pointing to a node C and to k other nodes which also point to C; we randomly choose |S k | different orderings of the edges of this network (one corresponding to each of the |S k | followers who are k-linked to the real ?-celebrity); and we then determine the fraction of these random orderings in which the A-C edge exhibit closure. We approximate the expected value of f k over randomly ordered edges by the average closure ratio among 100 runs of this simulation, and we define error bars using the minimum and the maximum fraction among the 100 simulations.",
               "We find the same trend for all the ?-celebrities in our sample, as shown in : there is some K such that for all k < K the actual value of f k is higher than the maximum fraction from the 100 simulations. This means that at least for small values of k the fraction of edges exhibiting closure is much higher than expected by chance. This suggests the existence of an underlying mechanism -copying of links or something producing similar observed behavior -that makes it more likely than chance to see edges that appear to be copied. For large values of k, the expected value of f k assuming random ordering of edges becomes very large, and it is hard for the values observed in the data to lie above the error bars; we find that for large k, the actual value of f k is very close to the average fraction among the 100 simulations and is inside the error bars.
