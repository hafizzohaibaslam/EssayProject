               "A social network is a social structure made up of a set of social actors and a set of the ties between these actors. A social network can be visualized as a graph, where nodes represent actors/participants (individuals, organizations, et al.) and edges (i.e. links) correspond to ties/interactions/relationships between actors. With the rapid development of internet, communication and cooperation between people have become more convenient. In recent years, online social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Weibo, have become an important part of our daily life and provide us platforms to exchange information with each other. Since the huge amounts of data on social networks has some obvious characteristics such as high quality, big data, semi-structure and direct reflection of real human society, many researchers from different areas or disciplines pay more and more attention to social networks. However, mining and analyzing social network data is a non-trivial task, which will face two challenges: incompletion and dynamic. First, almost all obtained social network data is incomplete since only part of social information can be collected from social network platforms. Second, social networks are highly dynamic, that might lead the nodes and edges to appear or disappear in the future. Therefore, predicting the missing or unobserved links in current social networks and newly added or deleted links in future social networks is very important, not only for understanding the evolution of social networks, but also for completing current social networks. This problem is commonly known as the Link Prediction. Being one of the link mining and analyzing tasks , link prediction has many important applications. First, it can be applied to recommender systems in information retrieval and e-commerce, which can help people to find new friends and potential collaborators , provide interesting items in online shopping , recommend patent partners in enterprise social networks and cross-domain partners , find experts or co-authors in academic social networks , and predict cell phone contacts in large scale communication network . Second, it also can be used to infer the complete networks based on partial observed networks , understand the evolution of networks better , and predict hyper-links in heterogeneous social networks . Finally, the link prediction techniques can also be applied in bioinformatics and biology, for example, in health care and gene expression networks , predicting specialists who are more likely to receive future referrals, and finding protein-protein interactions. Even in other domains such as security related domain, it can be used to identify abnormal communications .",
               "In the past decade, many efforts have been made by psychologists, computer scientists, physicists and economists to solve the link prediction problem in social networks. shows the number of published papers with search keywords \"link prediction social network\" on three important computer science libraries: ACM, IEEE, and Elsevier respectively from 2000 to 2013. It can be seen that more and more works pay attention to the link prediction in social networks, especially in the past five years, there are thousands papers related to this problem every year. Therefore, the research trend on this topic is growing. This paper carefully selects about 130 papers from 2000 to 2014, and most of which are published in the prominent journals (Nature, Physical Review, Physica A, TKDD, TWEB, DKE, JSS, JMLR, Social Networks, Computer Networks, and so on) and conferences (WSDM, SDM, KDD, JCDL, ICDM, CIKM, ICDM, WWW, ISWC, IJCAI, ICML, SIGCOMM, NIPS, ASONAM, et al.). shows the publication date of selected papers, which reveals that most papers are published in the past five years. shows that these selected papers are mainly finished by 19 countries, and the researchers from USA, China, Japan, France, Switzerland are more active in this problem. lists the top-10 institutions ranking by the number of published papers on link prediction, and we can see that not only academic institutions such as Stanford university and Cornell university, but also industrial companies such as IBM and Yahoo, are active in this problem.

Another interesting phenomenon is that link prediction problem also attracts the attentions from different disciplines. illustrates the disciplines of all authors in the selected papers and it is found that 98% authors are from four disciplines: computer science (87%), physics (7%), economics (3%), and management (1%). In particular, according to , only 15 (about 10%) papers are finished by cross-discipline authors: authors of 6 papers are from computer science and physics, authors of 3 papers are from computer science and economics, and 5 papers have co-authors from computer science and other disciplines. Therefore, researchers from different disciplines are still independent and lack cooperation on this problem. There have already been several excellent survey works for the link prediction problem . LibenNowell and Kleinberg provide useful information and insights for link prediction problem, with special reference to some classical prediction measures based on topological information of networks. This is a pioneering and influential work, but after 7 years, it is not able to cover the latest progress of the link prediction research. Land Zhou summarize popular link prediction algorithms for complex networks. However, they emphasize on the contributions from physical perspectives, instead of the perspectives of computer scientists. In addition, a complex network is a more abstract model than a real-world social network that we discuss in this paper. Therefore, although the link prediction algorithms summarized by Land Zhou are general and valuable, it still needs a new link prediction survey which will focus on social networks. Hasan and Zaki review some representative link prediction methods for social networks by categorizing them, especially, the survey mainly considers three types of models proposed in recent years: binary classification model, probabilistic model and linear algebraic model. It involves some new representative link prediction works, and it is more suitable for experts, but it is not comprehensive enough for a beginner who wants to learn the link prediction systematically.",
               "To fill up these gaps of existing survey works, this paper tries to provide a comprehensive and systematic survey for link prediction in social networks covering both classical and latest link prediction techniques, link prediction problems, link prediction applications, and active research groups. First, it gives the link prediction statement including formal definition, general solution framework and evaluation metric, especially, a new category of link prediction is proposed according to two perspectives: link prediction techniques and problems. Then link prediction techniques are presented from four kinds of aspects: node-based metrics, topology-based metrics, social-theory-based metrics and learning-based methods. Topology-based metrics and learning-based methods contain a lot of classical and new link prediction techniques. Based on the link prediction techniques, popular problems that link prediction often faces are discussed. Typical link prediction applications are additionally described. Active research groups are also presented to demonstrate the different solution perspectives and emphases of leading researchers about link prediction problems. Finally, besides the current achievements, some future challenges are also discussed.",

               "Consider a social network G(V, E) at a particular time t, where V and E are sets of nodes and links, respectively. The link prediction aims to predict new links or deleted links between nodes for a future time t (t > t), or missing links or unobserved links, in current network. This problem can be explained by a simple social network about five persons in , in which solid links indicate interactions already existed at time t, and dashed links indicate links that have newly appeared during the interval time . At time t, Alice and Bob are friends, Alice and Nick are also friends. At time t , maybe Alice has introduced Bob to Nick, they become friends too. Analogously, Nick and Amy would become friends at time t . The goal of link prediction problem here is to predict the appearance of newly added friendship between persons. In this paper, if there are no special declaration, the discussing link prediction work is under an assumption: the nodes in different time are static. Obviously, this assumption does not hold in real-world social networks, and it is one of the challenges in the future.",
               "To solve the link prediction problem, it needs to determine the formation or dissolution possibilities of links between all node pairs. Usually, such possibilities can be measured by similarities or relative ranks between node pairs. We use a generic framework to illustrate the link prediction solution as shown in . For an initial social network, there are two ways to predict the link evolution: similarity-based approaches and learning-based approaches. Here we take predicting the new/missing/unobserved links as examples. A similarity-based approach is to compute the similarities on non-connected pairs of nodes in a social network, namely, it is based on measures for analyzing the proximity of nodes. Every potential node pair (x, y) would be assigned a score, where higher score means higher probability that x and y will be linked in the future, and vice versa. Then a ranked list in decreasing order of scores is obtained and links at the top of list are most likely to appear. A learning-based approach is treating the link prediction problem as a binary classification task . Therefore, some typical machine learning models such as classifier and probabilistic model can be used for solving this problem. Each non-connected pair of nodes corresponds to an instance with features describing nodes and the class label. If there is a potential link connecting a pair of nodes, this pair is labeled as positive, otherwise it is negative. For the learning-based approaches, the features consist of two parts: one is the similarity features from the similarity-based approaches, another is the features derived from the social network, such as the textual information of attributes and domain knowledge. Link prediction for deleting/disappearing links can be solved analogously.",
               "There are many link prediction works, that focus on general link prediction techniques, discuss special link prediction problems, and employ existing link prediction techniques to deal with various applications. For the sake of clearly arranging these existing works, this paper proposes a new link prediction category with two perspectives: technique perspective and problem perspective. The category does not contain link prediction applications, since they are based on link prediction techniques and problems, and will be addressed independently. shows our category of link prediction techniques and link prediction problems. For link prediction techniques, they can be divided into four levels from top to bottom: (1) According to basic network information used in prediction, the first and highest level consists of node, topology, and social theory. (2) In the second level, topology is further divided into neighbor, path, and random walk; social theory is also divided into community, triad, structural hole, tie strength, and homophily. The third level includes popular basic link prediction techniques based on node, neighbor, path, random walk, and social theory. (4) In the fourth level, basic prediction techniques and external information, which includes weights, attributes and knowledge repository, provide features for complicated learning-based techniques, such as feature-based classification, kernel-based learning, probabilistic model and matrix factorization. All link prediction techniques are generic and can be used for solving various link prediction problems and applications. From another perspective, link prediction problems are arranged as three levels from bottom to top: (1) According to the object that link prediction problems concern, the first and lowest level divides the link prediction problems into network and link, the former concerns the global characteristic of network and the latter concerns link characteristic of network. (2) In the second level, the network is divided into heterogeneous network, location network, temporal network, and bipartite network; meanwhile; the link is also divided into multi-relation links, active/unactive links, and disappearing links. (3) The third level is the link prediction problems that are based on the link prediction techniques; consequently two perspectives join in here. Therefore, two perspectives are closely related. Furthermore, we should highlight that the category in can be extended with the progress of link prediction research.",
               "For the evaluation metrics used in link prediction, they commonly can be divided into two types: fixed threshold metrics and threshold curves. The precision and recall on top-N predictions are typical fixed threshold metrics. These measures often suffer from the limitation that they rely upon a reasonable threshold. Another kind of metrics are the threshold curves, such as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and precision-recall curves, are widely used in link prediction evaluation. Additionally the AUC (Areas Under ROC) is viewed as a robust measure in the presence of imbalance . AUC can be interpreted as the probability that a randomly chosen missing link has higher score than a randomly chosen nonexistent link. It is more difficult to specify and explain link prediction evaluation strategies than with standard classification wherein it is sufficient to fully specify a dataset, therefore, new evaluation methods or performance metrics are also to be proposed ."

It is based on the simple idea: the more similar the pair is, the more likelihood a link between them, and vice versa. This is consistent with the fact that users tend to create relationships with people who are similar in educations, religions, interests and locations. It can be measured by the similarity, in which each nonconnected pair of nodes (x, y) is assigned a score signifying similarity between x and y. A high score indicates high probability that x and y will be linked in the future, while a low score also indicates high probability that x and y will not be linked. Therefore, using the rank of similarity scores, we can predict the appearing or disappearing links in the future or unseen links in current networks.",
               "In a practical social network, a node usually has some attributes such as the profile in online social networks, mail name in email networks, and publication record in academic social networks. These information can be directly used for calculating the similarity between two nodes. Since in most cases the node attribute values are textual forms, the text-based and string-based similarity metrics are usually used here. Discussing classical text-based and string-based similarity measures is beyond the purpose of this paper, and readers can refer to some surveys .",

They also show that the increasing of number of friends and keywords lowers the average similarity between the user and his friends.",

Obviously, VCP cannot produce similarities between nodes, but it can be the classification feature vector for supervised learning methods that will be discussed in later section.

It even can encode continuous quantities such as edge weights by binning into relational categories, such as high activity and low activity. However, the number of subgraphs of VCP depends on n and r, that grows exponentially. For example, VCP 4,1 has 32 subgraphs and VCP 5,2 has 524,288 subgraphs.

Time complexity of path-based metrics is higher than neighbor-based ones. However, longer paths are not always more useful than shorter paths. In the theoretical justification of popular link prediction heuristics by Sarkar et al. , it shows that metrics considering longer paths is useful only if shorter paths are not numerous enough. Therefore, path-based metrics can optimize their performances by removing too long paths if networks have enough shorter paths."

For instance, decision tree, support vector machines, na?vena?ve Bayes, and so on. In order to build an efficient classifier for link prediction, it is crucial to define and extract a set of appropriate features from social networks. The features provided by node-based, topology-based and social theory based metrics are popular and important for classification learning models. For example, the VCP metric can be seen as a kind of special feature which describes local topology information . In addition, many studies show that using attributes of nodes and links (such as users' ages, interests, characteristics and friends) can significantly improve the link prediction performance. Li et al. presented a graph kernel-based learning method and used features such as age, education level, book title, keywords and introduction to predict user-item link in a bipartite network. Scellato et al. considered social features, place features and global features in location-based social networks for link prediction based on a supervised learning framework. The co-authorship social network is one of the most popular networks in link prediction. Ichise et al. introduced a semantic approach using abstract information, research titles and event information to improve the link prediction in a co-authorship social network. shows some commonly used features in a co-authorship network, and it contains node features, network features, topological features and non-topological features. The advantage of non-topological features is that it can improve the performance of link prediction problem. However, they are not always available and may be difficult to collect. More importantly, most non-topological features are domain related. It requires good domain knowledge to identify and discover them. Therefore, for a general link prediction learning model, it usually only considers the generic features including node, network and topological features, but for a practical link prediction application, non-topological features should also be considered. Finally, like many learning problems, feature selection in link prediction learning is the key task. Fortunately, a lot of feature selection work in machine learning area can be used. For example, Scripps et al. proposed a discriminative learning technique for link prediction based on the matrix alignment. The advantage of this method is that it can automatically determine the most predictive attributes and topological features by aligning the adjacency matrix of a network with weighted similarity matrices computed from node attributes and neighborhood topological features . Usually, people would think that the weight is also an important feature for link prediction learning. However, the relevance of weights for unsupervised link prediction methods is not always verified, in some cases, even the performance is harmed. For supervised link prediction methods, there are few works show that weights would improve the prediction results . But there are also some works believe that weights are useless for unsupervised link prediction . Therefore, it still needs comprehensive analysis on more datasets and applications in theory and evaluation study to determine the influence of weights.",

It is a probabilistic graph. There are many learningbased link prediction methods that have been proposed by exploiting the probabilistic graph model. Studies suggest that many networks exhibit hierarchical structure, where nodes divide into groups that can further subdivide into groups of groups, and so forth over multiple scale. Clauset et al. proposed a model to infer hierarchical structure from network and apply it to solve the link prediction problem. As shown in , a hierarchical network is represented by a dendrogram called hierarchical random graph, where N leaves corresponding to nodes of network and each of the N ? 1 internal nodes corresponds to a probability p r . The connecting probability of a pair of nodes equals to p r where r is the lowest common ancestor of the two nodes. For example, according to the dendrogram in , the connecting probability of node a and node c is 0.6, and the connecting probability of node b and node d is 0.3. Then the goal is to find the dendrogram that fits the observed network best. Given a network G and a dendrogram D, let E r be the number of edges where r is the lowest common ancestor of two nodes, and let L r and R r be the numbers of leaves in the left and right subtrees rooted at r. Then the likelihood of the network is:",
               "r The probability of internal nodes is easy to determine by maximizing L(D, {P r }). To predict whether a pair of non-connected nodes x and y are connected, it first samples a set of dendrograms with probability proportional to their likelihood, then computes the mean probability p xy over the sample dendrograms by averaging the corresponding probability p xy . Compared to the basic metrics such as common neighbor, the hierarchical random graph model is able to express assortative and disassortative structure and obtain accurate predictions for a wide range of networks. However, it takes a lot of computing time and usually is applied to deal with networks within thousands of nodes. In stochastic block model, nodes in the network are divided into several groups and nodes in the same group have same status . That is to say, whether two nodes will connect depends on the group to which they belong. A stochastic block model M = (P, Q) consists of two parts: a method of partition P and a probability matrix Q of two nodes in two different groups.

The marginalized denoising model proposed by Chen and Zhang could overcome this shortcomings. It treats the link prediction as a problem of matrix denoising, and the key point of this method is learning a mapping function that can map the matrix of current network with observed links to a new matrix of future network with unobserved links.",

To predict whether two nodes x and y will be linked, there are three steps: (1) Use topological information to identify the central neighborhood set of x and y. (2) Select itemsets that lie entirely within this set and use them as training data to train a local probabilistic model. Here, the training process is translated to a maximum entropy optimization problem. (3) Estimate the co-occurrence probability features through inference over the local model. Then Logistic Regression is used as a classifier to train the data which combines the above three types of features.",
               "Kashima et al. proposed a parameterized probabilistic model of network evolution to predict whether an edge between two nodes exists or not. In this model, the structure of a network changes probabilistically over time, namely, the edge label functionchanges over time. An edge label(x, y) indicates the probability that an edge exist between x and y.(t) denotes label function at time t. The model is assumed to be a Markov model in which(t+1) depends only on(t) . Assume that node x has a strong influence on y and there is a link between x and z, so there will likely be a link between y and z. In the model, there are two ways for(t) (x, y) to assume a particular label. One way is that node k has copied an edge label to node x or node y. The other is that(t) (x, y) =(t+1) (x, y), namely, nothing has happened. Then based on the assumption that the current network is a stationary state of the network evolution, an Expectation Maximization (EM)-type transductive learning approach is employed to estimate parameters of the model for predicting the existence of links. Therefore, the basic idea behind this model is: if you have a friend who has a strong influence on you, your association will be highly affected by the friend's association. This approach is based on the topological features of network structures and not on the node features. It differs from these earlier works in that the existence of tunable parameters within the network model naturally gives rise to a learning algorithm for link prediction, leading to improved accuracy of prediction. This model can be easily generalized to the scenario in which there are more than two edge labels. Yang et al. pointed that the information contained in interest networks and friendship networks is highly correlated and mutually helpful. Based on homophily, a friendship-interest propagation framework is proposed for linking a user to interested services and connecting different users with common interests. The framework devises a factor-based random walk model to explain friendship connections, and simultaneously it uses a coupled latent factor model to uncover interest interactions .",
               "Backstrom and Leskovec proposed an algorithm for link prediction based on supervised random walks. Unlike traditional PageRank assumes the same transition probabilities of all links, supervised random walks learn a function to assign different transition probability for each link so that the random walk is more likely to visit target nodes than other nodes of the network. The function (edge strength) is computed based on the attributes of node x and y, as well as the attributes of the link between x and y. In this way, the approach can combine structural information of the network with the attributes of nodes and links for link prediction. As shows, to predict new edges of a given source node s, there are three steps: (1) Using edge strength function to calculate the edge strengths of all edges. (2) A random walk with restarts is run from s, and the stationary distribution of the random walk assigns each node a probability. (3) A rank of nodes is generated by the order of this probability and the top ranked nodes are then predicted as destinations of future link links. Compared to supervised machine learning methods, this approach does not require complex network features and domain related knowledge.",
               "The structural information is useful for link prediction in a hybrid network . Link prediction can also be solved by mining graph evolution rules . The real-world network is usually incompletely observed. To predict which of the possible unobserved links are actually present in the network, Marchette and Priebe apply a constrained random dot product graph to rank the potential edges according to the probability that they are in fact present, and then utilize covariates to improve the link prediction . In link prediction, if the network itself is totally missing, namely, without the knowledge of an existing link structure, while some other information regarding the nodes is available such as interest group and tags, it is called the cold start link prediction problem. Leroy et al. discussed this problem and proposed a two-phase solution based on the bootstrap probabilistic graph. The first phase generates an implicit social network under the form of a probabilistic graph. The second phase applies probabilistic graphs-based measures to produce the final prediction.",

Especially in anonymous social networks like Foursquare and Secret App, only the aggregative statistics information like \"how many people like this restaurant\" is available. To predict the opinion holder in such heterogeneous social network without labeled data, generalized it to a link prediction with aggregative statistics problem and proposed an unsupervised probabilistic graphical model to solve it. First, a factor graph model with three layers of random variables infers the existence of unseen-type links. Then three types of potential functions integrate diverse information into the factor graph model. A ranked-margin learning algorithm tunes the parameters using aggregative statistics. Finally, a two-stage inference algorithm updates potential functions and optimizes the results. shows the comparison of some probabilistic graph models in link prediction. It can be seen that most methods use or modify existing probabilistic graph models such as random walk and factor graph model. Moreover, though most methods are suitable for general networks, some methods are devised for special networks such as hierarchical networks and incomplete networks. Like other kinds of learning- based methods, probabilistic graph models achieve better performance than basic topology-based metrics, especially improve the prediction accuracy. Finally, since the probabilistic graph models exploit global network information, some methods are scalable to large scale networks."

The datasets are important for fairly reproducing and comparing different link prediction methods. Constructing and collecting the datasets is a time-consuming and labor-intensive work. However, not all datasets are public and available. During surveying the link prediction works, we summarize some popular datasets used in link prediction, which are shown in . Especially, all the datasets are open, public, available and real-world. Online social network platforms (such as Twitter and Facebook) and public bibliography libraries (such as DBLP and Arxiv), are among the most popular sources of datasets. We notice that some datasets are well maintained by Stanford University. This would be an important reason that many researchers prefer to use these datasets. However, we have to point out some disadvantages of current datasets for link prediction. First, some datasets have noise, that must be cleaned before they are used. For example, all bibliographic networks are faced with the author name disambiguation problem, which will cause a lot of noise and make the networks inconsistent to the real-world networks. Second, these datasets are not rich and diverse enough in term of the size and network types. For some new and special link problems or applications, it may be unable to find existing datasets. Finally, when same metrics are compared on different datasets, their performance ranks are usually not consistent or even various greatly. However, current datasets are not enough for analyzing the strength and weakness of a link prediction metric or method. This would lead to misusing the link prediction methods. Therefore, it is necessary to build and maintain the benchmark datasets for link prediction problems. Although there are many link prediction metrics and methods proposed, only very few works open their source codes. People have to re-implement some complicate methods, and that is a time-consuming process. Only few public tools try to integrate these metrics and methods. It is very important for selecting the appropriate metrics or methods for a link prediction task. For example, LPmade, which is a cross-platform software solution, provides multi-core link prediction and related tasks and analysis . First, it is a scalable library which implements most commonly used unsupervised link prediction metrics, especially, all implementations have high performances. Second, it supports automatic link prediction processes including prediction, evaluation, and network analysis. If we have the benchmark datasets for link prediction, we could implement an open link prediction API with standard datasets loading, formatted results and automatic evaluation. It would also greatly reduce the evaluation work."

For the matrix-based part, it first collapses the network data into a single matrix. The collapsed tensor (CT) is produced by collapsing the network into a single matrix through summing all the entries across time. The improved collapsed tensor considers the weight when sum the slices in the time, and it is called the collapsed weighted tensor (CWT). CWT can give greater weight to more recent links. Then a matrix of scores for link prediction can be calculated by truncated SVD, and an extended Katz metric to the case of bipartite graphs and its relationship to the matrix SVD is also derived. Using the truncated SVD, this method is salable for calculating a truncated Katz score. However, there is no matrix-based method fully leverages and exposes the temporal information.",

Oyama et al. proposed the cross-temporal link prediction method, in which the links among nodes in different time frames are inferred, and a dimension reduction approach makes high dimensional data to be mapped to a low-dimensional latent feature space. Munasinghe and Ichise focused on the temporal behavior of the link strength, particularly the relationship between the time stamps of interactions or links and the temporal behavior of link strength and how link strength affects future link evolution. Most previous studies have neither sufficiently discussed the impact of time stamps of the interactions nor time stamps of the links on link evolution. It believes that the strength of a link varies over time. The nodes that do not interact with each other for a long time will cause the links become weaker. So higher scores are assigned to node pairs which have interacted with their common neighbors recently. In other words, if the difference between the time stamps of the most recent interactions of common neighbors having the node pair is small, then this difference has a greater effect on future links. Combining the above considerations, a new feature called time score (TS) is introduced, to take into account the time awareness for link prediction.

Specifically, for three nodes (s, n, t) and an edge type x, it first counts all triads with the same pattern as (s, n, t), then counts all triads with the same pattern with x added between s and t. P (xedge type(s, t)|pattern(s, n, t)) is determined by dividing the first count by the second count. This probability assumes that the observed pattern is correct except for the potential absence of type x, which simplifies the calculation.

It is robust to noise and has the exponential capability to capture nonlinear variance. Besides the computational benefits, this method devises two types of directed connections to the hidden variables: temporal connections and neighbor connections, which fit two well known assumptions: each node has a unique transitional pattern and a node's behavior is influenced by its local neighbors."

In addition, a reason of the link prediction being hard lies in the fact of most interesting linked datasets are very sparse.
