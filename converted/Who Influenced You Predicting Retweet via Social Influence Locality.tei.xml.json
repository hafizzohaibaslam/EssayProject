               "Social influence occurs when one's opinions, emotions, or behaviors are affected by others in a social network. However, social influence takes many forms and its underlying mechanism is still unclear. For example, how is one's behavior influenced by a group of friends who know each other and by the friends from different ego friend circles? In this paper, we study the social influence problem in a large microblogging network. Particularly, we consider users' (re)tweet behaviors and focus on investigating how friends in one's ego network influence her retweet behaviors. We propose a novel notion of social influence locality and develop two instantiation functions based on pairwise influence and structural diversity. The defined influence locality functions have strong predictive power. Without any additional features, we can obtain a F1-score of 71.65% for predicting users' retweet behaviors by training a logistic regression classifier based on the defined influence locality functions. We incorporate the social influence locality into a factor graph model, which can further leverage the network-based correlation. Our experiments on the large microblogging network show that the model significantly improves the precision of retweet prediction. Our analysis also reveals several intriguing discoveries. For example, if you have six friends retweeting a microblog, the average likelihood that you will also retweet it strongly depends on the structure among the six friends: the likelihood will significantly drop (only 1 6) when the six friends do not know each other comparing with the case when the six friends know each other."

               "At the high level, social influence has global patterns and local patterns. The former means that one's behavior is influenced by the global pattern in a social network. Examples of the global patterns include influence by a global culture and conform to the majority opinion in a community , and influence from external network . The latter, i.e., local patterns of social influence, means that one's behavior is influence by friends in her ego-network (refer to Section 2 for a formal definition). Examples of local patterns include pairwise influence , indirect influence , and topic-level influence [ . Social influence is a fundamental issue in social network analysis and it can benefit many real applications.

One important reason is that social influence takes many forms and each form may be determined by different factors.",
               "In this paper, we study the social influence problem in a large microblogging network, Weibo.com . Specifically, we consider users' (re)tweet behaviors and focus on investigating how friends in one's ego network influence her retweet behaviors.",
               "Illustrative example To clearly motivate this work, we first give a real example of retweet influence derived from the microblogging network (Weibo). We consider how a user's retweet behavior is influenced by her friends. (a)-1(c) shows three similar cases when user v has six friends already retweeted a microblog (referred to as active neighbors and denoted as red nodes). A white node indicates the corresponding user (friend) does not retweet the microblog (referred to as inactive neighbor). The difference of the three cases is that the inner structure of the six friends is different. In (a), the active neighbors A, C, and D are in one connected component, while B, E, and F are in another connected component. Thus the six active neighbors form two connected circles 2 . In (b) and 1(c), the number of the connected circles formed by the six active neighbors are respectively four and six. In the three cases, we have totally collected 5,736,320 user samples in case1, 984,230 user samples in case2, and 805,889 user samples in case3.",
               "We then study how likely user v will also retweet the microblog in the three different situations. We use a large microblogging network from Weibo to estimate the average probability that user v retweets the microblog in the three cases. We found several interesting patterns from the result as shown in . The average likelihood that user v retweets the microblog strongly depends on the inner structure among the six friends: the probability that user v retweets the microblog in case 1 is three times (3) higher than that in case 3. We further expand the analyses to more cases by varying the number of active neighbors and the number of formed connected circles. (e) shows the retweet probability by user v in various cases. It is very interesting that the retweet probability of user v is clearly negatively correlated with the number of connected circles formed by the active neighbors, no matter what kind of messages that have been retweeted by the neighbors. The retweet probabilities in this paper are all per user and are calculated by (#retweet users satisfying given conditions) / (#users satisfying given conditions). For example, to calculate the retweet probability in 1(a), we first find all users with six followees who already retweeted one same microblog and meanwhile the six followees form 2 circles. Then among all these users, we denote the number of the users who also retweeted the same microblog as N + and the number of the users who did not retweet the microblog as N ? . Finally, the retweet probability is calculated as N + /(N + + N ? ). The retweet probability is usally quite low because N + is often much smaller than N ? . From the above example, it seems that users' retweet behaviors are strongly influenced by friends in her ego network. However, what are fundamental factors that trigger the phenomenon and why? In this paper, we formalize the problem as social influence locality and try to conduct a systematical investigation on the problem. The challenges of the problem are as follows:",
               "-First, a straightforward question is: is there really influence between users for the retweet behavior? presents some intuitive explanation; however how to provide a theoretical proof. -Second, how to formally define this type of influence using a principled function? It is necessary to give a formal definition of the phenomenon and provide its instantiation. -Third, How to design a predictive model so that we can leverage the influence to predict users' retweet behaviors?",
               "Results To address the above challenges, we first employ Weibo data as the basis in our study and present a debias sampling method to prove the existence of social influence for the retweet behaviors. We then propose a formal definition of social influence locality and develop two instantiation functions of social influence locality for modeling the retweet behaviors. The defined influence locality function has a strong predictive power. We employ it for modeling and predicting users' retweet behaviors. Predicting users' retweet behaviors have many applications. For example, it can help recommending important tweets to users. Since with the rapid increasing number of tweets, information overload becomes a serious problem, which makes it urgent to recommend most interesting tweets to users . In addition, understanding how retweeting works can provide insight into how information spreads through large user communities and also have applications in marketing, such as influence maximization ].",
               "With merely a few features based on the influence locality functions, we could learn a simple classifier which results in good predictive performance, and is even better than existing methods that employ various features by +0.6% in terms of F1-measure. We further propose a factor graphic model for modeling and predicting users' retweet behaviors. The model not only considers traditional features for modeling users' retweet behaviors, but also incorporates social influence locality and network-based correlation into a probabilistic graphical model. Our experiments on the large microblogging network show that the model significantly improves the precision of retweet prediction. In addition, we also have several interesting findings:",
               "-There is a strong evidence for the existence of social influence locality. The fraction of active users (retweeted a microblog) with 2 active neighbors (followees who have retweeted the same microblog) is about 2 times greater than the fraction of active users with only one active neighbors (Cf. . -Though the probability of a user retweeting a microblog is positively correlated with the number of active neighbors, it is negatively correlated with the number of connected circles that are formed by those neighbors. When there are six active neighbors, the likelihood will significantly drop (only Compared with the previous conference version, the major improvements lie in that we conduct deeper analysis about the parameterof ego network, the whole data set distribution, the correlation feature and the basic features that influence the prediction performance.

User A is also called the follower of B and B is called the followee of A.",
               "As of December 2013, the total number of Sina Weibo users is about 560 million, a similar number to Twitter. This is obviously too large for a few tens of crawlers to collect the entire user space within a short period of time. We had to choose a sampling strategy. To begin with, 100 random users were selected as seed users, and then their followees and followees' followees were collected. In total 1,787,443 users were included in the core network. The crawling of the followees can make the core network more cohesive than crawling the followers, because many users are commonly followed by massive users. Then we monitor the dynamic changes of the \"following\" relationships for the 1,787,443 users from 8/28/2012 to 9/29/2012. Averagely there are 364,600 new \"following\" links and 267,515 \"unfollow\" links created per day. At the end of the crawling, we produced in total 4 billion following relationships among them, with average 200 followees per user. Notice that part of the final crawled users being followed may not be in the core network. Readers can refer to the Sina API of retrieving friend list for details . After crawling the network structure, for each one in the 1,787,443 core users, the crawler collected her 1,000 most recent microblogs. The process resulted in 1 billion microblogs in total. Each miscroblog can be either an original or a retweeted microblog and contains id, original microblog id, user id, content, time and so on. Readers can refer to the Sina API of retrieving user's microblogs for details . We also crawled all the users' profiles, which include name, gender, verification status, #bi-followers, #followers, #followees, creating time and so on. The specific format can refer to the Sina API of retrieving user profile 5 . We conducted some high level analyses on the crawled data set. shows several interesting statistics obtained from the data set. All the distributions are all drawn in log-log scale. shows the follower distribution per user. We see that a small portion of users has a huge number of followers. For example, 0.05% users have more than 2 million followers. The phenomenon coincides with the discoveries that 0.05% of the user population attracts almost 50% of all attention within Twitter [ ] and 1% of the Twitter users control 25% of the information diffusion in Twitter [ . shows the followee distribution per user. It seems that the number of the followees is almost averagely distributed in different ranges except the largest number of the followees (Sina weibo sets up a limitation that each user can only follow at most 3000 followees). shows the tweet distribution per user, i.e., the distribution of the number of microblogs posted by each user. We see that the distribution satisfies the power law distribution followed by an exponential tail, which is similar to the discoveries about human communications found by Wu et al. . shows the retweet distribution per original microblog, which presents an explicit power law trend. In this paper, we focus on studying the influence from the followees on one's retweet behavior in microblogging networks. For each investigated user sample, we need to make the followees in her ego network and the action status of those followees complete enough. Thus, we only consider the core network comprising of 1,787,443 users. We also select 300,000 popular microblog diffusion episodes from the above crawled data set. Each diffusion episode contains the original microblog and all its retweets. On average each microblog has been retweeted 80 times. The total number of retweets associated to the 300,000 diffuion episodes are 23,755,810. The sampled data set ensures that for each diffusion episode, the active (retweet) status of followees in one's-ego network is completed. In this way, we can better investigate the influence effect from the active followees of one user. lists statistics of the data set used in this paper.

For this purpose, randomized experiment is the preferred golden method. The basic idea is to partition users into two groups: treatment group V T and control group V C . For users in the treatment group, we assign some treatment of interest, and for users in the control group, we do not assign the treatment. In our test, the treatment of interest is defined as the social influence one would receive in her ego network. We associate a status for each user. If a user retweets a microblog posted by her friend, we say her status becomes active, otherwise inactive. Finally, we compare the activation statuses of all users between the two groups.",
               "One problem in the sampling test is how to randomly assign users to the treatment and the control groups. Straightforwardly, given a microblog, we could view users who have followees already retweeted the microblog as users in the treatment group, and assign users who do not have any followees retweeted the microblog to the control group. However, in practice, it is highly infeasible. This is because, in the microblogging network, if a user does not have any followees retweeted the microblog, she will have no chance to see the microblog and thus will not be possible to retweet it. To address this, we assign users who have only one followee retweeted the microblog to the control group and users who have more than one followees retweeted the microblog to the treatment group. In this sense, we try to evaluate the correlation between the probability of a user performing the retweet behavior and her active neighbors. Another trouble we are facing is the selection bias, that is users who were treated would have a higher activation probability than those who were not treated even though the treated users were not treated. This problem was also reported in the study on the influence of product adoption . Another bias is the confounding bias, e.g., popular microblogs make users more likely to retweet and be treated, and recently posted microblogs seem to be more likely to be retweeted.",
               "Methodologies To deal with the above problems, we use a matching-based sampling method for testing the influence. The intuition behind this method is to first fix users in the treatment group as those who have more than one followees retweeted a given microblog, and then for each user in the treatment group, we try to find the most matched user from the original control group, and finally construct a new control group by all the matched users. Specifically, we use a logistic regression model to learn a probabilistic classification model, and then apply the model to estimate the posterior probability of each user belonging to the treatment group. Finally, for a particular user uV T in the treatment group, we select user vV C who results in the minimal difference of the posterior probability with user u as u's matched user, i.e.,",

For each user who has retweeted m, we view her as active at a specific time span when she retweeted, and we also treat her as inactive instances at other time spans before she really retweeted. For each follower of an active user, we treat her as an inactive instance at every time span. Then we count the number of previous active neighbors for each active and in-active instance. Finally, we can determine the instances in the original treatment and control groups, and learn the logistic regression model based on them."

In this paper, we investigate whether the indirect influence from 2-ego network in Weibo network is evident. Specifically, we fix the number of active neighbors in one's 1-ego network, and then analyze the effect from active neighbors in 2-ego network. Here the neighbors are the users that a user directly (= 1) or indirectly (> 1) follows. The results are shown in . We can see from the figure that the effect from the active neighbors in 2-ego network almost remains unchanged when fixing the number of active neighbors in 1-ego network (i.e., from 1 to 5). We also find that the retweet probability increases with the number of active neighbors in 1-ego network. The results indicate that the retweet behaviors from the indirect followees in Weibo network exert little influence on users' retweet behaviors. The phenomenon can be explained as that users can not be easily exposed by the messages from their indirect followees, and thus the influence from those indirect followees is trivial. According to the analyses , we set the parameteras 1 and hence focus on the 1-ego network."

They simply consider the number of connected components (circles) as the indicator to analyze its correlation with the probability of user engagement to some activity, and find significantly positive correlation there. Will the structural diversity has the same effect on the retweet behavior? How to define an utility function to capture this effect? (e) plots the curves of retweet probability versus the number of connected circles formed by the active neighbors. Specifically, we analyze the results by varying the number of active neighbors by 2,3,4,5,6-10, 11-20, and 21-30 respectively. We see that, surprisingly, the retweet probability is negatively correlated with the number of circles, which is opposite to the discovery in . This phenomenon might be explained from the purpose of retweet. Boyd et al. found that one important purpose for people to retweet is to influence others. According to this, people may quickly lose interests to retweet when they find that many of their social circles are already aware of the message. We may also explain it by using the theory of peer pressure . Peer pressure is the influence that a peer group, observers or individual exerts that encourages others to change their attitudes, values, or behaviors to conform the group norms. If one user observes a microblog having been retweeted by many friends from one same group, she will be very likely to also retweet it under the peer pressure.",
               "Note that when calculating the number of circles, we only consider reciprocal (bidirectional) \"following\" relationships between users in one's ego network. This is because, we find that directional relationships are meaningless from an interaction point of view. Huberman et al. also empirically prove that a sparser and simpler network of actual friends is a more influential network in driving the microblogging usage ]. Furthermore, we also limit circles in k-brace (k is set as 2) as proposed by Ugander et al. , since two actual circles may be easily connected by an arbitrary local bridge, which however, should not be treated as in the same circle. k-brace circle is defined as the circle with all the edges of embeddedness less than k being removed, where embeddedness of an edge is the number of common neighbors shared by the two endpoints.",
               "We can use the same matched sampling method introduced in section 4 to test the structure influence from ego network. Specifically, we assign the users with only one connected component formed by the active neighbors to the control group, and the users with more than one connected component formed by the active neighbors to the treatment group. To reduce the selection bias caused by the assigning process, we find the most matched users from the original control group to each user in the treatment group to construct a new control group. We train a logistic regression model P (Y |X) to match users, where Y is the posterior probability of a user belonging to the treatment group (i.e., having more than one, e.g., five, active connected component), and X are all observed features except the number of the connected components. However, the matched sampling method is time consuming. It takes about more than seven days to get all the test results shown in with the scale of 1 million users. Actually, we tried the matched sampling method to test the structure influence on one setting, where users with 1 connected component formed by 5 active neighbors were assigned to the control group and users with 5 connected components formed by 5 active neighbors were assigned to the treatment group. We found from the test result that the ratio of the active users between the two groups was less than 1, which indicated that the users with less connected components formed by active neighbors are more likely to retweet. The result is actually consistent with the empirical analysis shown in (e). Considering the time efficiency, we empirically analyze the retweet probability under different number of circles formed by active neighbors.",

We define three kinds of basic features, including personal attributes, topic propensity and instantaneity. Specifically, we try six personal attributes, including the number of followees, the number of followers, the number of bi-followers (i.e., the reciprocal \"following\" relationships), the longevity (age of the account), gender (0 indicates male and 1 indicates female) and verification status (0 indicates being verified as a celebrity and 1 indicates not being verified). We summarize the statistics for the six personal attributes in . In order to investigate the correlation between the retweet probability and the influence from the active neighbors for users with different values of personal attributes, we divide each personal attribute into different ranges. For example, for the number of followees, we count the number of users with different number of followees and find the ten fractile respectively, and then for each ten fractile point, we investigate the retweet probabilities under the influence from 1 to 5 active neighbors. We analyze the retweet probabilities for users with different values of followers, bi-followers and longevity in the same way as followees. For gender and verification status, the values are naturally classified into 0 and 1. (a), we find that when the number of followees is too few (0-50), the whole retweet probability (the retweet probabilities under different number of active neighbors) is very low and the influence from active neighbors (the increase rate of the retweet probabilities from 1 to 5 active neighbors) almost exerts no effect. When the number of followees increases to 100-150, the whole retweet probability increases and the influence from active neighbors becomes evident. However, when the number of followees continues to increase, the whole retweet probability and the influence begin to decrease. The phenomenon may be explained as that when people follow a lot of users, the information source becomes overloaded, that makes people difficult to find valuable information to retweet. For the follower attribute in (b) and bi-follower attribute in (a), the patterns are similar to the followee attribute that the whole retweet probability and influence first rise then fall. The peak point for follower attribute is 700-1000 followers and for bi-follower, the peak point is 100-160. The phenomenon may be explained that when the social relationships grow up to a moderate status, the users are most active in retweeting and are also most easily influenced by the active neighbors in order to develop their social circle."

For predicting the behavior of user v i , the behaviors of v i 's neighbors before time t are viewed as the observable information and can be leveraged to predict the behavior of v i . However, when we change the setting as aftertime interval when a microblog m was published, predicting the retweet behaviors of all the users who have seen the microblog m, the behaviors of all the users to be predicted are actually dependent. For example, when two friends v i and v j are both the users to be predicted, one's behavior can not be viewed as the observable information and used as features to predict the behavior of another user. However, v i 's action status will be very likely to influence the action status of v j . In summary, the action status of one user not only depends on the predefined attributes associated to the user, but also may be influenced by the action statuses of the neighbors to be predicted.

Similar gradients can be derived for parameter. The graphical structure in the factor graphic model can be arbitrary and may contain cycles, which makes it intractable to directly calculate the marginal distribution P (y i |X, G). We choose Loopy Belief Propagation due to its ease of implementation and effectiveness. Specifically, we approximate the marginal distribution P (y i |X, G) using LBP. With the marginal probabilities, the gradient can be obtained by summing over all instances. It is worth noting that we need to perform the LBP process twice in each iteration, one time for estimating the marginal distribution of unknown variables, i.e., y i =?, and another time for estimating the marginal distribution over all instances. In this way, the algorithm essentially performs a semi-supervised learning over the complete network. This idea was first proposed in ] for learning to categorize social relationships.

Although we can use other prediction algorithms such as matrix factorization to verify the effects of the discovered influence patterns, logistic regression provides a coefficient for each feature, which suggests how the feature is used by the model to provide weight for or against a retweet behavior and provides proposals for how subset of these features offers evidence for retweet behaviors.

However, the structure influence presents insignificant effect.",
               "How structure influence help? Through the analyses in Section 5, we find that the probability of a user retweeting a microblog is negatively correlated with the number of connected circles that are formed by the active neighbors. However, the negative effect is evident only when the number of active neighbors is relatively large, i.e., larger than 5 active neighbors as shown in (e). The negative influence is insignificant when there are only a few active neighbors, i.e., less than 5 as shown in (e). However, through analyzing the instances in our dataset for prediction, we find that almost 80% instances only have one active neighbors, and the instances with the number of active neighbors larger than 5 only occupies 2.17% (shown in . Therefore, when we use those instances for training and test, the predictive performance is dominated by the instances with a few number of active neighbors and the effect of the number of circles can not be presented. To prove the effect of the structure influence, we sample the instances with the number of active neighbors larger than 5, and then use the sampled instances to conduct the training and test. We compare the performance of the logistic regression model with only the pairwise influence function g (LRC-Q(w = 1)) and the logistic regression model with both the pairwise influence function g and the structure influence function f (LRC-Q(w = 0.5)). The results presented in show that when adding the feature of structure influence, F1-measure is improved by about 8% and the accuracy is improved by about 3%. This indicates that structure influence can indeed improve the performance of retweet prediction when the number of active neighbors is large enough. We also notice that the whole performance in is lower than that in . It may due to the reason that users with large number of active neighbors are very likely to have similar personal attributes and propensity to retweet a microblog, and thus the behaviors of those users are more difficult to predict. In fact, in the current Sina Weibo system, when a user reads a microblog, the other neighbors who have already retweeted the microblog are also exposed to the user. This information is very useful to help the user determine whether the microblog is valuable or not. According to our experiments, if the system can cluster the active neighbors in different ego circles and tell the user in which circles the microblog has already been diffused, it will further benefit the user to identify valuable information, and meanwhile, the system can recommend the microblogs to the users according to the features more accurately.",
               "How correlation affects the predcitive performance? For evaluating the performance of factor graphic model, we construct data set in different ways. Specifically, for each microblog m, the positive instances, i.e., the users who retweeted a microblog m, are divided into training data and test set. The training data are those who retweeted m within 10 hours after m being published. Test set are those who retweeted m 10 hours after m being published. The negative instances, i.e., the followers of positive instances that were never observed to retweet m, are also divided into training data and test set in the same way, where the timestamps of the negative instances are randomly generated. shows the performance of LRC-BQ and FGM-BQ in the above experimental setting. The two methods both consider all the basic and influence locality features, while FGM-BQ also considers the correlations between instances additionally. We can see from the results that FGM-BQ outperforms LRC-BQ in terms of Precision but under-performs it in terms of Recall. This is because FGM-BQ uses additional features and the prediction conditions are more strict. In order to distinguish their difference, we perform sign test on their prediction results. The p-value of sign test is less than 0.001, which confirms that the factor graphic model considering the correlation feature significantly performs better than the logistic regression model without the correlation feature. We also find that the whole performance of this setting is lower than that in . This is because we only use the active users within 10 hours after a microblog m being published to construct influence locality features. Thus the information can be leveraged is less, which makes the prediction under this setting more difficult."

               "Social influence analysis We investigate the related work from two aspects, social influence analysis and retweet behavior prediction. Considerable work has been conduced for studying the effects of social influence. These studies can be roughly classified into three categories: influence testing , influence quantification [ , and influence models and maximization methods .",
               "Influence testing is to verify whether the influence indeed exists or not on certain behaviors. One kind of work focuses on statistical causal inference based on the observed data. For example, Arala et al. ] distinguished the effect of influence from homophily based on a statistical propensity score matching method. Fond et al. measured the gain in correlation and used a randomization technique to assess whether a significant portion of this gain is due to influence and/or homophily. Anagnostopoulos et al. proposed a shuffle test to examine the existence of social influence. Another kind of work leverages the online social networks to conduct real controlled trials. For examples, Bakshy et al. ] conducted randomized controlled trials to identify the effect of social influence on consumer responses to advertising, and Bond et al. ] used a randomized controlled trial to verify the social influence on political voting behaviors.",
               "Influence learning is to quantify influence. From the perspective of measured objects, we classify the studies into: quantifying influence from topic level , sentiment level , and so on. For example, Tang et al. proposed a Topical Affinity Propagation (TAP) approach to model the topic-level social influence in large networks. [ proposed a generative topic model to mine topic influence between users in heterogeneous networks. and measured the pairwise influence between two individuals based on the idea of independent cascade model ]. Xin et al. ] studied the indirect influence using the theory of quantum cognition. Myers et al. and proposed probabilistic mod-els to quantify the external influence out-of-network sources. proposed a probabilistic factor graphic model to quantify the individual, peer and group influence in a social network. formalized conformity influence and measured conformity of different roles. ] investigated and measured the influence between two communities. From the perspective of the measuring methods, , and used probabilistic topic models to learn the influential strength between papers or users. , and ] used probabilistic discriminative models to learn the weights of different influence factors. Some other work learns the influence based on the state-of-art influence models. For example, Gruhl et al. [ proposed a time-decayed diffusion model for blogging writing, and used an EM-like algorithm to estimate the influence probabilities. ] learned influence by solving a likelihood function based on time-decayed IC model. Some heuristic methods have also been proposed to quantify the influence. For example, Goyal et al. effectively calculated the influence probabilities by directly counting the number of actions in the collected data set.",
               "Influence models describe the process of how users influence each other. The state-ofart influence models include two fundamental diffusion models, Linear Threshold (LT) Model and Independent Cascade (IC) Model ]. Recent years, several new influence models considering different factors have been proposed, such as timedecayed Independent Cascade Model , topic sensitive Independent Cascade Model and Linear Threshold Model [ , influence models considering positive and negative opinions together , influence model considering friend and foe relationships together , and the diffusion model distinguishing user roles . Influence maximization is one of the most important applications of influence. The objective is to find K seeds in a network that can exert maximal influence. One kind of work is to propose more efficient maximization methods . Another kind of work is to propose the corresponding approximate solutions for variant influence models In this work, we mainly study the problem of influence testing and influence learning. The kind of influence we study is the aggregated influence from a user's ego network. The testing method is the statistical causal inference based on the observed data and the learning method is a heuristic method to quantify the influence from the pairwise and the structural angle.",
               "Retweet behavior study A bulk of studies try to understand why and how people retweet. gave an interesting investigation on the reasons why they retweet. The study was mainly based on human interviews and the results are lack of verification on real large data. Some other studies try to explain the retweet behaviors from different perspectives, for example, some researches focus on analyzing the effect of the content of the tweets on retweet probability. ] used a machine learning approach to learn the weights for different features extracted from the tweet content. They found that the tweets containing hashtags, URLs or usernames are more likely to be retweeted . [ tagged the tweets with Wikipedia categories and aggregated these tags for a particular user to generate a topics-of-interest profile for that user. They came up with four models and found the profile model (one would be more likely to retweet another user if they share similar profiles) was the most likely model. Some other perspectives such as the popularity of the topics, strength of the social ties, and the status of the publisher are also investigated by different researchers . Despite the success of the previous work, it would be interesting to see the influence effect of retweet behaviors from the neighbors on the user. All these works do not consider how friends in one's ego network influence the individual's behavior. This paper finds that by merely using the influence locality factors, we can train a simple predictive model to forecast users' retweet behaviors with high accuracy."

               "In this paper, we study a novel phenomenon of social influence locality, which is also proposed as a challenge in . We first conduct a sampling test to provide evidence of the existence of influence locality, and then formally define the influence locality function based on the observations of pairwise influence and structure influence on retweet behaviors. One interesting discovery is that retweet probability is negatively correlated with the number of connected circles that are formed by the active neighbors.We evaluate the influence locality functions through retweet behavior prediction by using the logistic regression model and the factor graphic model. Our experiments on retweet behavior prediction show that merely using single influence locality function, we can obtain a F1-score that is comparable with existing methods with a bunch of various features. In addition, we investigate the effect of correlation feature between the neighbors to be predicted by using the factor graphic model. The results show that the factor graphic model performs better in Precision than the logistic regression model without the correlation feature.",
               "As future work, it is interesting to study other functions to quantify the influence locality. In addition, traditional influence models only consider the pairwise influence between users, however, from the study in this paper, we know that the aggregated influence from the local ego network is different if the ego network structure constructed by the active neighbors is different. Thus, how to define an influence model by incorporating the structure influence is an interesting problem to be studied in the future."
