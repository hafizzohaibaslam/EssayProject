               "Understanding the scenarios in which newly launched products penetrate a market, and how those products supersede existing dominant products, is crucial. The ability to simulate such scenarios has direct applications in business education as well as increasing our understanding of marketing theory. The success of such a market entry is highly connected to the behavioural patterns and decision making processes of individual consumers. This behaviour is influenced by information made available through advertising and marketing efforts and its diffusion within consumer communities, a process that can be skewed and biased by possibly fake news and information. We present a market simulation in which an established product is gradually replaced by a new alternative. We show how fake news can influence the distribution of market shares depending on factors that include communication patterns and the credulousness of consumers. Finally we discuss these findings with respect to published models of information diffusion."

All actors are empowered to utilise their world knowledge to infer implicit knowledge as well as to decide how to act in specific situations. Agents in AGADE simulations are active parts of a complex social structure, in which they communicate with and learn from each other.",

Before starting a simulation the social structure comprised of the mutual relations of all agents has to be defined. The sociogram of the community can be defined interactively through an adjacency matrix of the underlying graph. However, as this is only possible for small sized communities, social structures can be set up automatically according to defined rules, for example, Erdoes-Renyi random graphs or graphs built with preferential attachment that show small-world like behaviour (see for details).",

This enables further inspection of the current state to happen but also lets users intervene by adjusting parameter settings. Current simulation data is displayed continuously. These features make AGADE a tool that can be applied in the context of business simulations (see ). In this paper we focus on the basic simulation features of AGADE and show how existing models can be extended to analyse advanced questions like the effect of rumours on the success of a newly launched product."

               "Our experiments are based on a scenario that models the diffusion of an innovative new product into a saturated market. Kiesling et. al. published a case study in which they investigated the launch of a second generation biofuel product into the Austrian market (see ). Kiesling argues that an agent-based model is to be preferred as alternative approaches e.g. existing mathematical models \"do not distinguish between the individual characteristics of consumers and thus neglect consumers' heterogeneity with regard to preferences and behaviour\". A product launch that needs high initial investment in infrastructure means that considerable financial resources are at stake until a sufficiently large share of the market can be conquered. In scenarios such as this, multi-agent simulations are valuable tools to predict answers to the crucial questions of whether a market ultimately accepts a product, and the time and funds needed to reach that goal. In this scenario was implemented using AGADE and the efficiency of this process using AGADE's semantic extensions was demonstrated. However, there are other factors that can affect the development of a market scenario and the relative positioning of goods within it, for example, fake, bad, or negative news. We extend the aforementioned scenarios to investigate the effect of negative news about a product spread during the product's launch and compare this for different social structures and different diffusion mechanisms (broadcast vs. viral mouth to mouth).",

The latter is determined by opinion and communicated information and can easily be influenced by bad news or rumours. We assume that information about products is either broadcast (conventional advertising) or spread virally through mouth to mouth communication. Our model respects both kinds of information propagation in each round of the simulation. Each agent has a numeric representation of how well informed he is (information level inf o a for agent a with 0 < inf o a < 1). If two agents a and a encounter a communication event we assume that the agent with the lower information level learns from the one with the higher one.

In the simulations describedwas set to 0.15 for all agents andwas chosen randomly in each round. Marketing activities focus on increasing the information level of each agent within reach of the activity. Therefore a marketing activity contains the variable information content value. The reach of marketing and advertising activities is modelled by a process that randomly selects agents that are then aware of the activity and a stochastic variable determining the (individual) impact of each marketing activity, that is, the value that may be added to the current information level of the agent. In each round of the simulation several marketing activities can be started.

The number of connections of a node added to the network was set to 10. Any node that is connected to more than 100 nodes is considered a hub. Due to the parameter settings of the network construction, approximately 1 percent of the agents are hubs. The weight of the edges connecting nodes to a hub is randomly set to an opinion influence value between 0.8 and 1. This lets hubs act as opinion leaders who strongly influence buying decisions of other consumers through communication events. Additionally experience events occur randomly in each round after the first time the agent has bought biofuel. These events determine how personal experience of the new product develops for each consumer.",

               "The reach of each marketing activity is limited to 10% of the overall number of participating agents in each period. Whenever an agent is reached by a marketing activity, the information content value is added to biofuel information level of the agent i.e. inf o t (a, biof uel) is updated. Initially, fossil fuel is the only fuel consumers can buy. At the beginning of the simulation the consumers are not even aware that there is an alternative product such as biofuel. The only fuel which is modelled in the private ontology is fossil fuel. When biofuel is launched into the market, the seller agent initiates marketing activities to spread information about the new product. Agents then start adding this new information to their private ontology and develop its information level through personal conversation with other agents or through information gathered from advertising. The decision of whether to buy biofuel depends on the individual's utility values and thresholds. shows the results of the basic scenario from . We now extend this scenario to simulate bad news about the new product. In our first experiment we let 10 hub agents produce bad news and rumours about biofuel during period 100 and 125 i.e. these agents communicate an information value of ?1 in their communication events. This value spreads out through the network depending on the degree of connectedness of the agents hit by such an event. shows how this word of mouth diffusion leads to a significant decline of the number of biofuel consumers. Recovery takes place in around period 180 after which the process continues as it would have done without the disturbance and runs into saturation similar to . In a second setting we now let 10 randomly selected agents (no hub agents) produce bad news and rumours about biofuel during period 100 and 125. shows that there is still an effect and that the number of biofuel users surmount that of the fossil fuel but this effect is much weaker than it was with communication through hubs. In a third setting we have simulated the direct broadcast of bad news. This is done by elaborately adding marketing activities with a negative information value and significantly higher reach than usual marketing activities (50 percent instead of 10 percent). In we can see that again we have a strong effect on the distribution of market shares. The damping is similar to that of our first scenario in which rumours were spread through hubs. Finally we have run additional simulations with increasing numbers of agents to see how the model scales up. Models with up to 10000 consumer agents and respective parameters e.g. for hub identification show identical behaviour. Concluding we have shown that the viral spread of news in a community can at least be as efficient as direct broadcasting This results confirms to our findings when experimenting with mobile phone markets (see )."

               "The concept of ideas and thoughts passing through societies and evolving in a manner similar to biological evolution was first discussed by where the term meme was used to describe an idea or behaviour that spreads through society and evolves during this process. When the meme is spread to an individual it may modify the behaviour or beliefs of that individual, in turn the individual may pass the meme on further. An individual may modify a meme prior to passing it on, based on the beliefs and state of the individual (which may have in turn been influenced by other memes).",
               "In the field of social simulation the passing of ideas and concepts within groups of agents has been described as a simulation of memetics. Axelrodstudied the effects of social influence on agents, in particular showing how agents that are neighbours are likely to adopt traits from each other. Axelrod goes on to demonstrate that specific cultural regions comprising agents with similar traits can emerge, but ultimately they may be move towards a polarised global environment as local groups converge.",
               "Axelrods' early simulation of cultural dissemination was based on an abstract grid world, a more recent simulation of memes, influenced by advertising within the Health Care environment has been explored by Sutcliffe and Wang . In their work the authors simulate the effects of health care advertising (e.g. campaigns for healthy eating) and their effects on the behaviour of agents. The effects of specific memes on individuals are defined by Bayesian models which determine whether an individual will alter its behaviour based on the receipt of a particular meme. The spread of memes is controlled through a social network layer, which controls how memes spread between individuals. The authors conclude that broadcast style propagation (e.g. advertising) is potentially more effective than memes being spread directly between agent networks. Suctcliffe et. al. examine the specific area of health education, many of the basic concepts may be applicable to the wider field of consumer advertising as discussed in this paper.",
               "Within this paper we discuss the simulation of adoption of an innovative product, biofuel, and how the spread of memes can influence the adoption of such an innovation. The definitive work on the adoption of innovation is by Rogers . Rogers discusses the means by which innovation spreads through societies and the manners in which innovations are adopted, in particular Rogers describes five groups of adopters (Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority and Laggards) and how these groups adopt at different rates and influence others through the concept of opinion leadership.",
               "Although memetics can provide some of the mechanisms for the spread of ideas and influences, techniques used to model the spread of infections are also relevant. Zhang et. al. demonstrate how diseases such as influenza may be spread through a city. In particular the artificial city model used by the authors simulates social contact as well as more formal networks, in this way social contact between agents (e.g. due to friendship or use of public transport) is captured. Although used for simulating the spread of disease, the model described could be adapted for simulating the spread of memes though an artificial city.",
               "Another perspective is the analogy between the spread of innovations and that of epidemics. Zafarani et. al. discuss how classical models of mathematical epidemiology can be used to describe the flow of information in social networks (see ). If we consider consumers buying fossil fuel as those who are susceptible for the innovation of biofuel and biofuel buyers as those being infected, the simulations in the previous chapter can be compared with the SIS model. The SIS model belongs to a set of models extending the basic SI model. SIS stands for susceptible-infectious-susceptible meaning that a person once having been infected becomes susceptible again without immunisation and removal of the model. This respects the effect that consumers that have adopted the new product may well return to their initial choice. The SIS model describes the population dynamics of the susceptible and the infectious portion by means of two ordinary differential equations with appropriate parameter setting and starting values. Jin et. al. discuss how the SIS model and a model derived from that (SEIZ) can be used to model the spread of rumours on Twitter. As we have argued before the advantage of using the agent based approach lies in the fact that we do not have to calibrate the parameters of differential equations but rather have to describe the behaviour of the individuals. This leads to a higher degree of freedom while still producing results confirming to accepted methods. As our experiments have shown we can model singularities (like sudden appearance of -possibly fake -news about a product) which is hardly possible in a purely equation based model. shows how the diffusion of innovation (biofuel) simulated with AGADE behaves like that of Zafarani's SIS model which is shown in . Furthermore, if agents that have been hit by bad news subsequently decide to return to their initial choice and become totally hostile to the innovation, classified as rejecters, then we get a model with dynamics analogous to that of the SIR (susceptible-infectious-recovered) model as shown in .

Further investigations into how news and rumours influence public opinion seem promising because the semantic approach of AGADE supports elaborate models of behavioural patterns for individual agents. A potential application of scenarios that model the influence of fake news could be a marketing tool to assess possible actions to be executed in the aftermath of a fake news attack on a company or product. Besides looking at additional consumers models, our approach can also be used to model communities and the spread of fake news within then making it feasible to simulate sociological research questions about the interplay between marketing, information diffusion, and behaviour."
