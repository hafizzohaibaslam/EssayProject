               "We study an interesting phenomenon of social influence locality in a large microblogging network, which suggests that users' behaviors are mainly influenced by close friends in their ego networks. We provide a formal definition for the notion of social influence locality and develop two instan-tiation functions based on pairwise influence and structural diversity. The defined influence locality functions have strong predictive power. Without any additional features, we can obtain a F1-score of 71.65% for predicting users' retweet behaviors by training a logistic regression classifier based on the defined functions. Our analysis also reveals several intriguing discoveries. For example, though the probability of a user retweeting a microblog is positively correlated with the number of friends who have retweeted the microblog, it is surprisingly negatively correlated with the number of connected circles that are formed by those friends. understand the underlying mechanism that users' retweet behaviors influence with each other. We formulate the notion of social influence locality and verify its effects in the mi-croblogging network. Definition 1 Social Influence Locality. Let G = (V, E) denote a social network, where V is a set of users and E ? V �� V is a set of directed relationships between users. For a user v �� V , we use G �� v ? G to denote v's ��-ego network, where ��-ego network means a subnetwork formed by v's ��-degree friends in the network G and �� �� 1 is a tunable integer parameter to control the scale of the ego network. Assume each user is associated with an action status s v �� {0, 1}, with s v = 1 indicating active and s v = 0 inactive. Given S v = {v i |v i �� G �� v �� s vi = 1} as the collection of active neighbors in v's ego network G �� v , social influence locality is defined as a function to quantify how user v's behavior (action status) is influenced by other users in her ��-ego network,"

For example, for modeling the retweet behaviors in the microblogging network, as users have directed (following) relationships with each other, we consider all the following relationships between users in the-ego network. shows an example of the-ego network (= 2) of user v (centered in the network), with six directed neighbors active and five inactive. By taking a close look at the inner structure formed by those neighbors, we could find that users A and B are not directly connected, E and F are connected with each other, while C and D also are not directly connected, but they are connected via H, except v. In this sense, the six active neighbors form four connected circles 2 . It is non-trivial to instantiate the function Q(S v , Gv ) of social influence locality.

Section 4 explains We first engage into a sampling test to verify the existence of social influence locality for the retweet behaviors. This problem can be connected to the causality inference problem . For this purpose, randomized experiment is the preferred golden method. The basic idea is to partition users into two groups: treatment group V T and control group V C . For users in the treatment group, we assign some treatment of interest, and for users in the control group, we do not assign the treatment. In our test, the treatment of interest is defined as the social influence one would receive in her ego network. We associate a status for each user. If a user retweets a microblog posted by her friend, we say her status becomes active, otherwise inactive. Finally, we compare the activation statuses of all users between the two groups.",
               "One problem in the sampling test is how to randomly assign users to the treatment and the control groups. Straightforwardly, given a microblog, we could view users who have followees already retweeted the microblog as users in the treatment group, and assign users who do not have any followees retweeted the microblog to the control group. However, in practice, it is highly infeasible. This is because in the microblogging network if a user does not have any followees retweeted the microblog, she will have no chance to see the microblog and thus will not be possible to retweet it. To address this, we assign users who have only one followee retweeted the microblog to the control group and users who have more than one followee retweeted the microblog to the treatment group. In this sense, we try to evaluate the correlation between the probability of a user performing the retweet behavior and her active neighbors. Another trouble we are facing with is the selection bias, that is users who were treated would have a higher activation probability than those who were not treated even though the treated users were not treated. This problem was also reported in the study on the influence of product adoption . Another bias is the confounding bias, e.g., popular microblogs make users more likely to retweet and be treated, and recently posted microblogs seem to be more likely to be retweeted. original treatment and control groups, and learn the logistic regression model based on them.",
               "Methodologies. To deal with the above problems, we use a matching-based sampling method for testing the influence. The intuition behind this method is to first fix users in the treatment group as those who have more than one followee retweeted a given microblog, and then for each user in the treatment group, we try to find the most matched user from the original control group, and finally construct a new control group by all the matched users. Specifically, we use a logistic regression model to learn a probabilistic classification model, and then apply the model to estimate the posterior probability of each user belonging to the treatment group. Finally, for a particular user uV T in the treatment group, we select user vV C who results in the minimal difference of the posterior probability with user u as u's matched user, i.e.,",

To quantify this, we cast the problem as measuring the relatedness between nodes in a graph and use the theory of random walk with restart (RWR) ] to achieve it.",

The random walk probability can be explained as how the influence of an active neighbor can finally reach the given user v via the network connection between them. For example, as shown in , user B only has one path to reach v, while F has a number of different paths to connect v through E and another two users. shows the probability that a user retweets a microblog conditioned on the average random walk probability (a) and sum of the random walk probability (b) of all active neighbors in her ego network.

As observed in , user v has six active neighbors, A, B, C, D, E, and F , who form four connected circles. How is the influence locality correlated with the inner structure of active neighbors? A more specific question is: comparing with A and B who distribute into different circles, will the pair of users C and D who reside in the same circle have the same influence effect on v's retweet behavior? Literature reports that structural diversity can be used as a positive predictor of user engagement. They simply consider the number of connected components (circles) as the indicator to analyze its correlation with the probability of user engagement to some activity, and find significantly positive correlation there. Will the structural diversity has the same effect on the retweet behavior? How to define an utility function to capture this effect? plots the curves of retweet probability versus the number of connected circles formed by the active neighbors. Specifically, we analyze the results by varying the number of active neighbors by 2,3,4,5,6-10, 11-20, and 21-30 respectively. We see that, surprisingly, the retweet probability is negatively correlated with the number of circles, which is opposite to the discovery in . This phenomenon might be explained from the purpose of retweet. Boyd et al. found that one important purpose for people to retweet is to influence others. According to this, people may quickly lose interests to retweet when they find that many of their social circles are already aware of the message.",

The result suggests that the followees with different retweet time actually exert different influence on retweet behaviors. Besides, we also find that arithmetic mean performs poorly comparing with geometric mean for both the time weighted pairwise influence (g 5 under-performs g 6 ) and the pairwise influence without time weighting (g 2 under-performs g 3 ). This is due to the reason that the estimates of the pairwise influence from the active neighbors are not normally distributed but right-skewed. That is, the majority of pairwise influence are low and a minority of pairwise influence are scattered in a fat right tail. We can see that for structure influence, f 2 function considering both the number of active neighbors and the number of circles formed by them performs better than only considering the number of circles, which indicates that there in deed exists strong correlation between the two factors. Existing social influence research studies different forms of influence. For example, Tang et al. and propose measuring the influence on different topics. and measure the pairwise influence between two individuals based on the idea of independent cascade model . ] study the indirect influence using the theory of quantum cognition. Myers et al. propose a probabilistic model to quantify the external influence out-ofnetwork sources. Belak et al. investigate and measure the influence between two communities. In this work, we study the influence from a user's ego network and formally defines it as social influence locality.",
               "A bulk of studies try to understand why and how people retweet. give an interesting investigation on the reasons why they retweet. Some other researches try to explain the retweet behaviors from different perspectives, for example, popularity of the topics, strength of the social ties, and the status of the publisher ."

               "In this paper, we study a novel idea of social influence locality for modeling users' retweet behaviors in the microblogging network. We first conduct a sampling test to provide evidence for the existence of influence locality, and then formally define the influence locality function based on the observations of pairwise influence and structure influence on the retweet behaviors. Our experiments on retweet behavior prediction show that merely using single influence locality function, we can obtain a F1-score that is comparable with existing methods with a bunch of various features.",
               "As future work, it is interesting to study other functions to quantify the influence locality. It is also interesting to extend study on larger scale ego network (> 1). For the retweet prediction problem, it is also helpful to design a better predictive model with higher accuracy."
