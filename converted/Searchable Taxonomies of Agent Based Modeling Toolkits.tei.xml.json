Abstract In this paper, we present a web-based search appliance for Agent Based Modeling (ABM) toolkit selection. This search appliance enables users to query a comprehensive ABM repository to determine toolkits that are appropriate for their project. It searches the repository according to the criteria set forth by the user, and then it displays the results in a series of user friendly and interactive graphical and textual tables. It also serves as a potential client base for further research into ABM toolkits; Once on the site, the users are asked if they would like to participate in a toolkit survey, thereby furthering ABM research and also feeding back to improve the web tool itself. In this research, we have addressed these limitations through a comprehensive ABM toolkit survey, in which we have examined many of the less well known platforms in addition to the most popular ones [Nikolai and Madey 2009]. Next we assimilated this information into a relational database. Now we take the next step and create a search engine that quickly and efficiently helps users from any discipline to find a list of toolkits that are applicable for their research."

               "Agent Based Modeling is a simulation paradigm in which one uses bottom up techniques to model large numbers of very simple agents. The behavior of agents is specified via a set of individual rules and then the agents are \"let loose\" in a simulation environment. As the agents interact with each other, researchers examine the emergent behavior of the system and try to draw inferences and make conclusions . This paper is structured as follows: First, we discuss our general methodology. Next, we discuss several agent based modeling taxonomies based on our research. After that, we outline the content of the search engine, and we describe the basic system workflow. Then, we examine each of the search engine subsystems and the underlying databases. Next, we show several example searches using the search engine. Following this, we discuss the limitations of this work. Finally, we finish with a few concluding remarks and references.",

A second limitation is that since this type of modeling and simulation spans multiple disciplinary fields, the surveys that are available are scattered across multiple domains (e.g. computer science, social science, artificial intelligence [ [ .

               "The research underlying this repository is a culmination of on-going research into ABM toolkits over the last 12 months. We began by gathering a comprehensive list of agent based toolkits available and that are being used in some fashion for ABM purposes (see table 1). These include any platforms that are available, including open source and closed source, general purpose and specialized, as well as free and proprietary toolkits. We tried to make this as comprehensive as possible. Next, we gathered available information from open sources. We scoured white papers, technical papers, journals, and various websites to gather as much information as possible. Where there was third-hand information, we confirmed it by going directly to the source. Then, we sorted through all the information and created various taxonomies based on major classifications. Next, we created a database repository of these classifications. Finally, we implemented an online search engine to allow users to access the information in a variety of ways in a centralized location. That is, users can input a range of desired toolkit characteristics, and the tool returns a list of candidate platforms that contain those characteristics. There are four main characteristics available across the spectrum of toolkits from which the users can choose: programming language required to create a model or simulation, operating system required to run the toolkit, type of license governing the platform, and primary domain for which the toolkit is intended.",
               "We chose these characteristics because they are usually the first features that one looks at when choosing a toolkit for a project The next three largest contingents are C, C++, and the Logo dialects. About 17% of the platforms use C++ to program models, about 11% use C, and about 8% use a variant of Logo. Approximately 28% of the toolkits use a platform-specific language which the toolkit authors designed to facilitate programming models and simulations in that domain. Note that the sum of this collective is above 100%. This is because several platforms support multiple languages. See for the complete set of taxonomies."

An important note for the reader is that these are the primary domains for which the toolkit has been designed, and these are the primary domains for which the toolkit has been documented as a primary domain. Note that many toolkits are used for more domains that just their primary. The secondary domains, however, have extremely unequal and incomplete representation. Therefore, we do not attempt to classify toolkits further than their primary domain. Also note that the domain categories listed here are the terminology of the toolkit documentation. As such, we do not attempt to disambiguate domain terminology. Rather, the goal is to give the user a broad feel for the types of domains for which these toolkits may be applicable, so it will bring to the fore potential toolkits that the user otherwise may not have considered.

We used recommended techniques such as writing clear questions, using syntax and linguistics to facilitate understanding and respondent recall, and developing unscaled response lists to minimize question bias, memory error, and measurement error. We used odd numbered Likert scales to allow for neutrality in decisions by the respondent.

Although we are focused in this research on ABM, the distinction is not clear because some toolkits with ABM contain underlying artificial intelligence and the ability to create more advanced agents, and some MAS are able to create larger numbers of simple agents."
