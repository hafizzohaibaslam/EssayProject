               "As part of the recent surge of research on large, complex networks and their properties, a considerable amount of attention has been devoted to the computational analysis of social networksstructures whose nodes represent people or other entities embedded in a social context, and whose edges represent interaction, collaboration, or influence between entities. Natural examples of social networks include the set of all scientists in a particular discipline, with edges joining pairs who have co-authored papers; the set of all employees in a large company, with edges joining pairs working on a common project; or a collection of business leaders, with edges joining pairs who have served together on a corporate board of directors. The availability of large, detailed datasets encoding such networks has stimulated extensive study of their basic properties, and the identification of recurring structural features. (See, for example, the work of Watts and Strogatz , Watts , Grossman , Newman , and Adamic and Adar , or, for a thorough recent survey, Newman .) Social networks are highly dynamic objects; they grow and change quickly over time through the addition of new edges, signifying the appearance of new interactions in the underlying social structure. Understanding the mechanisms by which they evolve is a fundamental question that is still not well understood, and it forms the motivation for our work here. We define and study a basic computational problem underlying social network evolution, the link prediction problem:",
               "Given a snapshot of a social network at time t, we seek to accurately predict the edges that will be added to the network during the interval from time t to a given future time t .",
               "In effect, the link prediction problem asks: to what extent can the evolution of a social network be modeled using features intrinsic to the network itself ? Consider a co-authorship network among scientists, for example. There are many reasons, exogenous to the network, why two scientists who have never written a paper together will do so in the next few years: for example, they may happen to become geographically close when one of them changes institutions. Such collaborations can be hard to predict. But one also senses that a large number of new collaborations are hinted at by the topology of the network: two scientists who are \"close\" in the network will have colleagues in common, and will travel in similar circles; this suggests that they themselves are more likely to collaborate in the near future. Our goal is to make this intuitive notion precise, and to understand which measures of \"proximity\" in a network lead to the most accurate link predictions. We find that a number of proximity measures lead to predictions that outperform chance by factors of 40 to 50, indicating that the network topology does indeed contain latent information from which to infer future interactions. Moreover, certain fairly subtle measures-involving infinite sums over paths in the network-often outperform more direct measures, such as shortest-path distances and numbers of shared neighbors.",
               "We believe that a primary contribution of the present paper is in the area of network evolution models. While there has been a proliferation of such models in recent years-see, for example, the work of Jin et al. , Barabasi et al. , and Davidsen et al. for recent work on collaboration networks, or the survey of Newman -they have generally been evaluated only by asking whether they reproduce certain global structural features observed in real networks. As a result, it has been difficult to evaluate and compare different approaches on a principled footing. Link prediction, on the other hand, offers a very natural basis for such evaluations: a network model is useful to the extent that it can support meaningful inferences from observed network data. One sees a related approach in recent work of Newman , who considers the correlation between certain network growth models and data on the appearance of edges of co-authorship networks.",
               "In addition to its role as a basic question in social network evolution, the link prediction problem could be relevant to a number of interesting current applications of social networks. Increasingly, for example, researchers in artificial intelligence and data mining have argued that a large organization, such as a company, can benefit from the interactions within the informal social network among its members; these serve to supplement the official hierarchy imposed by the organization itself . Effective methods for link prediction could be used to analyze such a social network, and suggest promising interactions or collaborations that have not yet been utilized within the organization. In a different vein, research in security has recently begun to emphasize the role of social network analysis, largely motivated by the problem of monitoring terrorist networks; link prediction in this context allows one to conjecture that particular individuals are working together even though their interaction has not been directly observed .",
               "The link prediction problem is also related to the problem of inferring missing links from an observed network: in a number of domains, one constructs a network of interactions based on observable data and then tries to infer additional links that, while not directly visible, are likely to exist . This line of work differs from our problem formulation in that it works with a static snapshot of a network, rather than considering network evolution; it also tends to take into account specific attributes of the nodes in the network, rather than evaluating the power of prediction methods based purely on the graph structure.",

We choose four times t 0 < t 0 < t 1 < t 1 , and give an algorithm access to the network G[t 0 , t 0 ]; it must then output a list of edges, not present in G[t 0 , t 0 ], that are predicted to appear in the network G[t 1 , t 1 ].

Adamic and Adar consider a related measure, in the context of deciding when two personal home pages are strongly \"related.\" To do this, they compute features of the pages, and define the similarity between two pages to be 1 log(frequency(z)) .

It would interesting to understand the generality of these overlap phenomena, especially since certain of the large overlaps do not seem to follow obviously from the definitions of the measures. It is harder to quantify the relationships among the datasets, but this is a very interesting issue as well. One perspective is provided by the methods based on low-rank approximation: on four of the datasets, their performance tends to be best at an intermediate rank, while on gr-qc they perform best at rank 1. This suggests a sense in which the collaborations in gr-qc have a much \"simpler\" structure than in the other four. One also observes the apparent importance of node degree in the hep-ph collaborations: the preferential attachment predictor-which considers only the number (and not the identity) of a scientist's co-authors-does uncharacteristically well on this dataset, outperforming the basic graph distance predictor. Finally, it would be interesting to make precise a sense in which astro-ph is a \"difficult\" dataset, given the low performance of all methods relative to random, and the fact that none beats simple ranking by common neighbors. We will explore this issue further below when we consider collaboration data drawn from other fields.  Small worlds. It is reassuring that even the basic graph distance predictor handily outperforms random predictions, but this measure has severe limitations. Extensive research has been devoted to understanding the so-called small world problem in collaboration networks-i.e., accounting for the existence of short paths connecting virtually every pair of scientists . This property is normally viewed as a vital fact about the scientific community (new ideas spread quickly, and every discipline interacts with and gains from other fields) but in the context of our prediction task, we come to a different conclusion: the small world problem is really a problem. The shortest path between two scientists in wholly unrelated disciplines is often very short (and very tenuous). To take one particular (but not atypical) example, the developmental psychologist Jean Piaget has as small an Erd?s Number-three -as most mathematicians and computer scientists. Overall, the basic graph distance predictor is not competitive with most of the other approaches studied; our most successful link predictors can be viewed as using measures of proximity that are robust to the few edges that result from rare collaborations between fields.",

               "The breadth of the data. We also have considered three other datasets:  Performance versus random swells dramatically as the topical focus of our data set widens. That is, when we consider a more diverse collection of scientists, it is fundamentally easier to group scientists into fields of study (and outperform random predictions, which will usually make guesses between fields). When we consider a sufficiently narrow set of researchers-e.g., STOC/FOCSalmost any author can collaborate with almost any other author, and there seems to a strong random component to new collaborations. (In extensive experiments on the STOC/FOCS data, we could not beat random guessing by a factor of more than about seven.) It is an interesting challenge to formalize the sense in which the STOC/FOCS collaborations are truly intractable to predict-i.e., to what extent information about new collaborations is simply not present in the old collaboration data.",
               "Future directions. While the predictors we have discussed perform reasonably well, even the best (Katz clustering on gr-qc) is correct on only about 16% of its predictions. There is clearly much room for improvement in performance on this task, and finding ways to take better advantage of the information in the training data is an interesting open question. Another issue is to improve the efficiency of the proximity-based methods on very large networks; fast algorithms for approximating the distribution of node-to-node distances may be one approach . The graph G collab is a lossy representation of the data; we can also consider a bipartite collaboration graph B collab , with a vertex for every author and paper, and an edge connecting each paper to each of its authors. The bipartite graph contains more information than G collab , so we may hope that predictors can use it to improve performance. The size of B collab is much larger than G collab , making experiments prohibitive, but we have tried using the SimRank and Katz predictors on smaller datasets (gr-qc, or shorter training periods). Their performance does not seem to improve, but perhaps other predictors can fruitfully exploit the additional information in B collab . predictor astro-ph cond-mat gr-qc hep-ph hep-th graph distance (all distance-three pairs)",

               "Similarly, our experiments treat all training period collaborations equally. Perhaps one can improve performance by treating more recent collaborations as more important than older ones. One could also tune the parameters of the Katz predictor, e.g., by dividing the training set into temporal segments, trainingon the beginning, and then using the end of the training set to make final predictions.",
               "Finally, there has been relevant work in the machine learning community on estimating distribution support: given samples from an unknown probability distribution P , we must find a \"simple\" set S so that Pr x?P [x /S] <. We can view training period collaborations as samples drawn from a probability distribution on pairs of scientists; our goal is to approximate the set of pairs that have positive probability of collaborating. It is an open question whether these techniques can be fruitfully applied to the link prediction problem."
