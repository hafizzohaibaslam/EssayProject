               "This paper examines important factors for link prediction in networks and provides a general, high-performance framework for the prediction task. Link prediction in sparse networks presents a significant challenge due to the inherent disproportion of links that can form to links that do form. Previous research has typically approached this as an unsu-pervised problem. While this is not the first work to explore supervised learning, many factors significant in influencing and guiding classification remain unexplored. In this paper , we consider these factors by first motivating the use of a supervised framework through a careful investigation of issues such as network observational period, generality of existing methods, variance reduction, topological causes and degrees of imbalance, and sampling approaches. We also present an effective flow-based predicting algorithm, offer formal bounds on imbalance in sparse network link prediction , and employ an evaluation method appropriate for the observed imbalance. Our careful consideration of the above issues ultimately leads to a completely general framework that outperforms unsupervised link prediction methods by more than 30% AUC."

Security agencies can more precisely focus their efforts based on probable relationships in malicious networks that have heretofore gone unobserved . In social networks, individuals can efficiently and effectively find companions, assistants, or colleagues . In medicine and biology, link prediction can be used to find relationships and associations that exist, but which might otherwise surface only after arduous and expensive research and study on a huge selection of agents. Finally, researchers can easily adapt link prediction methods to identify links that are surprising given their surrounding network, or which may not belong at all . Put simply, any environment that naturally maps to a network probably has an equally coherent mapping from link prediction in that network back to an important question in the environment.",
               "This broad applicability demands a powerful yet general framework, and we promote supervised learning. Unsupervised methods, which receive the most attention in link prediction literature, are fundamentally unable to cope with dynamics, interdependencies, and other properties in networks. We recognize that this is not the first paper to apply supervised learning to the link prediction problem, but there are important differences versus past work. First, in spite of the excellent intentions of past researchers, they have fallen prey to unique pitfalls endemic to problems with highly imbalanced class distributions. In , the holdout test set is undersampled to balance, and the authors of also contribute only a sample of the negative instances to their test set. As researchers familiar with high skew are aware, modifying the data distribution on which testing is performed generates uninterpretable results. The distribution of the resulting testing data no longer presents the same challenges as the real-world distribution, and performance measures in testing no longer reflect the real capabilities and limitations of the model. Additionally, both of these works employ semantic and contextual information that pertains almost exclusively to the bibliographic domain. Finally, these works do not consider the important impact of geodesic distance and the intricacies of class imbalance specific to the task of link prediction.",
               "We demonstrate that decomposition by geodesic distance has important impacts on predictor performance irrespective of the choice of predictor. We also expand the library of unsupervised measures with an intuitive flow-based metric that is over 15% AUC more predictive than baseline methods in certain networks. After illustrating the benefits of supervised learning, we cast link prediction as a problem in class imbalance. The result of these considerations is a framework that improves upon the best baseline unsupervised methods by over 30% AUC in our test networks. Furthermore, the framework is entirely general, operating over any class of network whether it be weighted, unweighted, directed, or undirected. It does not require any node attributes but is capable of accepting them.",

Section 4 lays out the rationale for supervised learning. This leads to a discussion of class imbalance in Section 5. In Section 6 we describe our realization of the framework and Section 7 presents results. Finally, Section 8 provides recommendations and concludes. components provides some insight into the broad topological structure of the network."

The average clustering coefficient measures the tendency of nodes in the network to be connected in dense groups.

The size and diameter of such Scalar measures often used in link prediction, such as precision on the top-N predictions and factors of improvement in precision over random models, rely upon the application of an arbitrary and often unjustified threshold. Most of our evaluation relies instead upon receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. These curves present achievable true positive rates (T P ) with respect to all false positive rates (F P ) by varying the decision threshold on probability estimations or scores. ROC curves provide information about the operating range of classifiers. For example, classifier A may outperform classifier B when we dictate F P < 20% but B may outperform A when we allow F P20%. The expected performance of a random classifier is the line y = x, and curves below this line indicate an inverted predictor. Finally, we can say that classifier A dominates classifier B in ROC space if all points on the convex hull of A dominate all points on the convex hull of B in the xy-plane, and this is a condition known to correlate highly with superiority in many other measures . The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a related scalar measure of the performance over all thresholds. AUC has classically been used as a measure of performance in imbalanced learning."

The restrictions are that the walk terminates upon reaching vj or upon revisiting any node including vi. The walk selects links based on their weights. This produces a score sij that can serve as an estimation of the likelihood of new links. PropFlow is somewhat similar to Rooted PageRank, but it is a more localized measure of propagation, and is insensitive to topological noise far from the source node. Unlike Rooted PageRank, the computation of PropFlow does not require walk restarts or convergence but simply employs a modified breadth-first search restricted to height l. It is thus much faster to compute. It may be used on weighted, unweighted, directed, or undirected networks. We supply the detailed procedure for weighted, directed networks in Algorithm 1.",

We attribute this success to the nature of the mechanisms in phone underlying the appearance of new links. Although it may be used in any network, PropFlow has special intuitive significance as a link predictor in networks where some reWhile past studies on link prediction have focused on unsupervised single metrics, some recent works have used a supervised classification scheme, and rightly so. If one accepts the basic premise that ground truth, whether a link forms or not, is always available from prior incarnations of the network, there is no practical disadvantage to using a supervised framework. Even training classifiers based on a single unsupervised method has the potential to outperform rankings generated by sorting the scores of the method if there are multiple differentiating boundaries in the domain of scores. Supervised algorithms are also able to capture important interdependency relationships between topological properties. While past studies simply acknowledged this fact and trained classifiers, we probe more deeply into the relevant issues so that we can fully understand how to frame the prediction problem and why a supervised framework is best for the task. We first address the how question in Section 4.1 by examining how to best transform network data into standard data sets. We then address the why question in sections 4.2, 4.3, and throughout section 5. More specifically, Section 4.2 explains that supervised approaches are adaptive and may be more general whereas unsupervised methods are invariant. Section 4.3 demonstrates that unsupervised methods cannot be, or at least have not been, combined into ensembles to reduce variance. Section 5 explains that unsupervised methods are inherently incapable of combating extreme class imbalance, a natural characteristic of link prediction in nearly any network."

Regardless, the network evolves through time to present a longitudinal source of data. We see then that link prediction, a domain in which unsupervised topological measures receive much attention, is very often suitable for supervised learning. The acquisition of ground truth for constructing models does not mitigate the necessity of the task; future forms of the static network will raise the same questions that exist in the present.",

A significant novelty of link prediction as a supervised learning problem is its extreme imbalance, which reaches past the most skewed distributions studied by the imbalance community.

Ensembles consist of many models that have been trained on slightly perturbed variations of the data. It is difficult or impossible to accomplish the same goal with unsupervised methods common in link prediction because the score is invariant for a given potential link. Furthermore, it is likely that network analogs to common ensemble sampling techniques are fundamentally flawed as a rough corollary of work in , where samples of networks with ill-behaving distributions produce new networks with different properties. Nevertheless, we wanted to explore the potential for one method of ensemble construction using unsupervised methods. To achieve the values in , we construct 10 new networks, randomly selecting p percent of the edges in the original network for each. Then, we compute a common neighbors score for the pair in each network and combine the scores using a summary statistic.",

What the figure does not show is that the p = 100 ROC curve dominates all ROC curves for p < 100, including mean and max, and that transformations of the ROC curves into precision-recall space show p = 100 greatly outperforms even p = 95.

               "In link prediction, graph distance plays a primary role in determining the imbalance ratio. We define the n-degree neighborhood of a node vi as the set of nodes exactly n hops away from vi. As n increases, the number of potential links will increase in proportion to the superlinear increase in the number of neighbors. Simultaneously, it is reasonable to expect that the new links will tend to form between nodes that are close, such as in phone where local influences such as recommendations and common neighbors pertain. illustrates the imbalance behavior of the phone and condmat networks. It also demonstrates the distribution of distances between pairs of nodes for all distances where the underlying computation is feasible. It is important to note here that phone has a diameter in its largest strongly connected component of 25 while condmat has a diameter of only 19 in its largest connected component. Further, the n6-degree neighborhood of any given node in phone still includes only a moderate fraction of nodes in the network. In the much smaller condmat network, the n6-degree neighborhood of any given node often approaches the periphery and includes almost every node in the network. The simultaneous severe increase in unformed potential links and severe decrease in links that actually form causes even more dramatic increases in imbalance ratios. phone imbalance goes from 131:1 at n = 2 to 32,880:1 at n = 4 and 606,926:1 at n = 6. condmat imbalance goes from 179:1 at n = 2 to 6,247:1 at n = 4. Fortunately, there is often little reason to believe that the benefit of successfully predicting links to nodes at high n is greater than the benefit of predicting them at low n.",
               "Given that imbalance increases so sharply between neighborhoods, and local mechanisms quickly give way to global mechanisms at higher values of n, we suggest that each neighborhood should be treated as a separate problem in supervised learning. This also allows us to avoid the V :1 imbalance of the general problem. Additionally, in the case of the entire class of neighbor-based models, there is null output for n3 in undirected networks because there is no sense in which such nodes can have common neighbors. Many unsupervised methods have implicit or explicit adjustments for graph distance, but the fundamental distinction of neighborhood comes for free. Supervised models may benefit from a decrease in noise and, for networks in which the distance spanned by the predicted link is inconsequential, the consideration of low n saves computational time."

We use two different ensemble methods: bagging and random forests. Random forests is an excel- Percentage Positive lent method for these data sets for two reasons. First, the data sets are composed of a combination of strong features and weak features. While the weak features are occasionally helpful, random forests is an excellent method to prevent overfitting them. Second, the decreased training time for each single tree counters the increased training time to build the forest, making it an especially efficient method of variance reduction for these large data sets. In both data sets, after undersampling to balance, we found on average a 4.04% AUC improvement moving from a single tree to 10 bagged trees and an additional 3.91% improvement moving from 10 bagged trees to 10 bagged random forests. The total average improvement of 8.11% justifies the use of these variance reduction methods, and the sheer size of the testing sets lends significance to even fractional percentage improvements. We found that neither 100 bagged trees without random forests nor 100 random forest trees without bagging offered the same improvements. Finally, we note that the improvements we observed after the application of these techniques are impressive, but still suboptimal. We constructed our ensembles from the same selection of undersampled negative class instances. With a minimal penalty in computational time, each member of the ensemble could make use of a random selection of the entire set of negative class instances. "

In doing so, we had to carefully consider the enormity of the data sets, especially for large values of n. As shows, in phone n = 2 produces 81.4 million instances and n = 4 produces 2.2 billion instances. Even in the smaller condmat network, n = 2 produces 431.6 thousand instances and n = 4 produces 8.1 million instances.",
               "One of the best oversampling strategies, SMOTE , is O(p 2| x|), the product of the number of positive class instances p and the length of the feature vector. While this may work for condmat where p is on the order of thousands, it certainly will not work for phone. We also theorize that phone, with p in the order of tens or hundreds of thousands, does not suffer as much from lack of definition in the positive class as from a strong classifier bias toward f (x) = 0 from prior information. Furthermore, oversampling approaches only increase data set size and training time. We considered training skew-insensitive decision trees based on Hellinger distance . Such trees are best when trained on the original training set distribution, however, and performed poorly with undersampled data. Without undersampling, the training set sizes for the data often render training with these trees infeasible. Undersampling, on the other hand, can help to mitigate the problem of class imbalance while also reducing the size of the training set.",
               "In section 5.2 we argue for treating each neighborhood as a separate problem. This also allows for skew-combating methods that are appropriate to the particular neighborhood. If n2 is combined into a single data set and subsequently uniformly undersampled, negative representatives of n = 2 will be underrepresented causing a distortion of the real n = 2 class boundary.",
               "The class ratio to which the data set is undersampled serves as a significant parameter to our framework. In we explore a wide range of possible sampling parameters using a single C4.5 decision tree evaluated according to AUC. The performance of the phone data set is relatively stable, but it exhibits an interesting trend wherein AUC drops slightly when the class distribution is balanced. condmat achieves AUC values that are higher with increasing negative class representation through the ratios we tested. Despite these results, in Section 7 we undersample the training sets to balance to present a consistent view of performance.",
               "We would like to mention that the beneficial relationship between link prediction researchers and class imbalance researchers is mutual. Class imbalance research contributes many options to the link prediction community. Simultaneously, link prediction offers the potential for a wide variety of data sets that match or surpass the imbalance ratios of the most demanding publicly available data. Any large network can become an authentic source for data with selectable features, selectable imbalance ratios depending on the chosen value of n, and a large pool of positive instances from which to draw the desired positive class cardinality.

               "The phone and condmat curves illustrate that the mechanism by which links arise is indeed different both across networks and geodesic distances. In fact, this leads to an interesting broad observation about mechanisms of link formation. In the condmat network, individuals have a global view of the topology through a variety of means. In essence, researchers know of other eminent researchers in the field however remote they may be in terms of geodesic distance. In the phone network, there is little reason to suspect that individuals have much knowledge of other individuals at remote locations in the network. The performance of the preferential attachment method supports this theory in the two networks; it is much stronger for condmat than for phone. Additionally, it shows performance that increases with n in both networks. The more distance potential links span in a network, the weaker local influences such as neighbor recommendations or path-based considerations become. The discriminative power of methods based on these principles generally drops accordingly. On the other hand, global influences such as degree have the same interpretation at any distance in the network. As the local influences lose their meaning with increasing n, the preferential attachment method becomes an increasingly pure estimation of link formation biases.",
               "We can clearly see the deterioration in predictive capacity of the local methods. Neighbor-based methods perform worse for n = 3 than for n = 2 phone, and they perform much worse for n = 4 than for n = 3. Neighbor-based methods have no meaning for n3 in directed networks such as condmat; there is no sense in which two unconnected individuals greater than two hops away from each other can share a neighbor. The PropFlow predictor degrades more gracefully than neighbor-based methods in phone but suffers mediocre performance on condmat. Despite much greater curve areas in phone, PropFlow does not dominate other measures. Instead, methods based on common neighbors achieve slightly higher T P rates at very low F P rates, but PropFlow rapidly surpasses them. Importantly, the HPLP dominates all other methods in ROC space in every case except phone n = 2, where PropFlow actually crosses at F P = 0.99. On a more general note, especially in phone where imbalance ratios grow higher, the increasing difficulty of more distant neighborhoods is exhibited in the form of ROC curves that converge toward T P = F P .",
               "We now move to the discussion of AUC values and . HPLP achieves performance levels as much as 30% higher than the best unsupervised methods. The difference in performance between HPLP and HPLP+ averages < 1% AUC. Though it does not appear in the figures, in phone we also created a data set with all unsupervised methods except PropFlow. We found that PropFlow alone achieves higher performance than using all other unsupervised methods put together when using the same basic supporting features, such as node degree. To substantiate the hypothe- sis that there are useful dependencies between features, we compared na?vena?ve Bayes to a single C4.5 tree and confirmed that the latter wins by > 2.3%. Nonetheless, even using a single, fast na?vena?ve Bayes classifier, HPLP always greatly outperforms the strongest of the unsupervised methods. To provide statistical significance to this statement, we used two-tailed paired t-tests. The paired samples come from 10-fold cross validation AUC scores. For all values of n, HPLP outperforms unsupervised methods at over 99% confidence and HPLP+ outperforms them at over 99.99% confidence."

Although it outperforms such methods by > 30% in terms of AUC, it does not require any domain-specific node attributes to do so. It can be applied in any domain exactly as described or it can accept any number of domain-specific features. It is also highly scalable; feature computation for a single pathbased method requires more time than the entire classification framework. The feature computation itself is embarrassingly parallel.",
               "In addition to the results, the supporting study allows for some recommendations. Unsurprisingly, for networks where topological convergence and saturation may be a concern, the training observation period,x, should be as long as possible. The parametery for the static network from which labels are gathered should match the size of the real-world prediction window so that testing and real-world prior distributions are as similar as possible. In link prediction on networks such as the Internet or electricity grids, these concerns are moot since snapshots contain the entire network structure.",
               "Optimal class ratios for undersampling are specific to the problem at hand, but the results we obtained for both networks indicate that undersampling to balance may not be ideal in the link prediction domain. Those employing this classification framework should be aware of this fact and should investigate other ratios as resources permit. For small networks where computational resources are not problematic, we advise the use of skew-insensitive classifiers such as Hellinger trees in an ensemble framework. We encourage the community to consider the link prediction task as a separate problem for each desired neighborhood in domains where local mechanisms are likely to pertain. This not only decreases computational time by considering those links most likely to rank highly regardless but has the potential to sensitize supervised classification to the specific mechanisms and boundaries present for predictions within the target graph distances.",

No such method, no matter how high its performance in some subset of our data, provides acceptable performance for the entire range of problems. Where there is some limitation on supervised learning due to the unavailability of labels for training, we hope that the included study of unsupervised performance measures proves helpful in the selection of an appropriate option. For networks where one expects local mechanisms to dominate, especially local mechanisms related to flow or propagation, we highly encourage the use of the unsupervised method, PropFlow, proposed in this paper.",
