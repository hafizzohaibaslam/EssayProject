               "Considerable attention has recently been devoted to investigating the structure and function of various networks including computer networks, social networks and the World Wide Web . From a functional point of view, networks can mediate diffusion of various things such as innovation and topics. However, undesirable things can also spread through networks. For example, computer viruses can spread through computer networks and email networks, and malicious rumors can spread through social networks among individuals. Thus, developing effective strategies for preventing the spread of undesirable things through a network is an important research issue. Previous work studied strategies for reducing the spread size by removing nodes from a network. It has been shown in particular that the strategy of removing nodes in decreasing order of out-degree can often be effective . Here notice that removal of nodes by necessity involves removal of links. Namely, the task of removing links is more fundamental than that of removing nodes. Therefore, preventing the spread of undesirable things by removing links from the underlying network is an important problem.",
               "In contrast, finding influential nodes that are effective for the spread of information through a social network is also an important research issue in terms of sociology and \"viral marketing\" ). Thus, researchers have recently studied a combinatorial optimization problem called the influence maximization problem on a network under the independent cascade (IC) model, a widely-used fundamental probabilistic model of information diffusion. Here, the influence maximization problem is the problem of extracting a set of k nodes to target for initial activation such that it yields the largest expected spread of information, where k is a given positive integer. Note also that the IC model can be identified with the so-called susceptible/infective/recoverd (SIR) model for the spread of disease in a network ( ).",
               "The problem we address in this paper is a dual problem to the influence maximization problem. The problem is to minimize the spread of undesirable things by blocking a limited number of links in a network. More specifically, when some undesirable thing starts with any node and diffuses through the network under the IC model, we consider finding a set of k links such that the resulting network by blocking those links minimizes the expected contamination area of the undesirable thing, where k is a given positive integer. We refer to this combinatorial optimization problem as the contamination minimization problem. For this problem, we propose a novel method for efficiently finding a good approximate solution on the basis of a naturally greedy strategy. Using large real networks including a blog network, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms link-removal heuristics that rely on the well-studied notions of betweenness and out-degree. In particular, we show that unlike the case of removing nodes, blocking links between nodes with high out-degrees is not necessarily effective for our problem."

When a node u first becomes active at timestep t, it is given a single chance to activate each currently inactive child node w, and succeeds with probability p. If u succeeds, then w will become active at time-step t + 1. If multiple parent nodes of w first become active at time-step t, then their activation attempts are sequenced in an arbitrary order, but all performed at time-step t.

Here, as in , the circles, triangles, diamonds and squares indicate the results for the proposed, betweenness, out-degree and random methods, respectively. In , the dashed line indicates the contamination degree of the network obtained by the proposed method for k = 300. We also see from Figures 5 and 6 that the proposed method outperformed the betweenness, out-degree and random methods for the Wikipedia network. In particualr, we observe from that as the value of k increased, the performance difference between the proposed and betweenness methods gradually increased. Note here that blocking 300 links means blocking about 0.12% of the links in the Wikipedia network. Thus, we find from that by appropriately blocking about 0.12% of the links in the Wikipedia network, the proposed and betweenness methods decreased contamination degree by about 26% and 16%, respectively. Hence, we can deduce that the proposed method was effective, and also outperformed the betweennes method by about 10% at k = 300 for the Wikipedia network. Moreover, we find from Figure 6 that blocking 300 links by using the proposed method was the same as blocking about 30000 links by using the out-degree and random methods for the Wikipedia network. Namely, we can deduce that the proposed method was effective about 100 times as much as the out-degree and random methods at k = 300 for the Wikipedia network.",
               "These results imply that the proposed method works effectively as expected, and significantly outperforms the conventional link-removal heuristics, that is, the betweenness, out-degree and random methods. This shows that a significantly better link-blocking strategy for reducing the spread size of contamination can be obtained by explicitly incorporating the diffusion dynamics of contamination in a network, rather than relying solely on structual properties of the graph.",
               "We note from Figures 4 and 6 that the out-degree method was almost the same as or worse than the random method in performance. In the task of removing nodes from a network, the out-degree heuristic has been effective since many links can be blocked at the same time by removing nodes with high out-degrees. However, we find that in the task of blocking a limited number of links, the strategy of blocking links between nodes with high out-degrees is not necessarily effective. "

               "In an attempt to minimize the spread of undesirable things by blocking links in a network, we have considered the contamination minimization problem, a dual problem to the influence maximization problem for social networks. This minimization problem is another approach to the problem of preventing the spread of contamination by removing nodes in a network, We have proposed a novel method for efficiently finding a good approximate solution to this problem on the basis of the greedy algorithm and the bond percolation method. Using large-scale blog and Wikipedia networks, we have experimentally demonstrated that the proposed method effectively works, and also significantly outperforms the conventional link-removal heuristics based on the betweenness and out-degree. Moreover, we have found that unlike the task of removing nodes, the strategy of blocking links between nodes with high out-degrees is not necessarily effective for our problem."
