               "We present a cost based comparative study of homogeneous and heterogeneous clustered sensor networks. We focus on the case where the base station is remotely located and the sensor nodes are not mobile. Since we are concerned with the overall network dimensioning problem, we take into account the manufacturing cost of the hardware as well as the battery energy of the nodes. A homogeneous sensor network consists of identical nodes, while a heterogeneous sensor network consists of two or more types of nodes (organized into hierarchical clusters). We first consider single hop clustered sensor networks (nodes use single hopping to reach the cluster heads). We use LEACH as the representative single hop homogeneous network, and a sensor network with two types of nodes as a representative single hop heterogeneous network. For multi-hop homogeneous networks (nodes use multi-hopping to reach the cluster head), we propose and analyze a multi-hop variant of LEACH that we call M-LEACH. We show that M-LEACH has better energy efficiency than LEACH in many cases. We then compare the cost of multi-hop clustered sensor networks with M-LEACH as the representative homogeneous network, and a sensor network with two types of nodes (that use in-cluster multi-hopping) as the representative heterogeneous network. be overloaded with the long range transmissions to the remote base station, and the extra processing necessary for data aggregation and protocol coordination. As a result the cluster head nodes expire before other nodes. However it is desirable to ensure that all the nodes run out of their battery at about the same time, so that very little residual energy is wasted when the system expires. One way to ensure this is to rotate the role of a cluster head randomly and periodically over all the nodes as proposed in LEACH [5]. However the downside of using a homogeneous network and role rotation is that all the nodes should be capable of acting as cluster heads, and therefore should possess the necessary hardware capabilities."

Researchers have studied several aspects of wireless sensor networks such as routing, MAC and collaborative data gathering mechanisms ( , , , , ). Energy efficiency is a key design objective in most of the research related to wireless sensor networks because the nodes are severely energy constrained, and battery replenishment is often not practical. However besides energy efficiency, hardware complexity is another important aspect that needs to be taken into account when studying the overall network design problem.",

Cluster heads also serve as fusion points for aggregation of data, so that the amount of data that is actually transmitted to the base station is reduced. Clustered sensor networks can be classified into two broad types; homogeneous and heterogeneous sensor networks.",
               "In homogeneous networks all the sensor nodes are identical in terms of battery energy and hardware complexity. With purely static clustering (cluster heads once elected, serve for the entire lifetime of the network) in a homogeneous network, it is evident that the cluster head nodes will On the other hand, in a heterogeneous sensor network, two or more different types of nodes with different battery energy and functionality are used. The motivation being that the more complex hardware and the extra battery energy can be embedded in few cluster head nodes, thereby reducing the hardware cost of the rest of the network. However fixing the cluster head nodes means that role rotation is no longer possible. When the sensor nodes use single hopping to reach the cluster head, the nodes that are farthest from the cluster heads always spend more energy than the nodes that are closer to the cluster heads. On the other hand when nodes use multi-hopping to reach the cluster head, the nodes that are closest to the cluster head have the highest energy burden due to relaying . Consequently there always exists a non-uniform energy drainage pattern in the network.",

While heterogeneous networks achieve the former, the homogeneous networks achieve the latter. However both features cannot be incorporated in the same network. The objective of this paper is to compare homogeneous and heterogeneous sensor networks from the point of view of the overall network cost by taking into account the above energy-hardware trade-off.",

This ensures that the following two sets of nodes are relieved of their energy burdens: 1. The cluster head nodes which have to perform long range transmissions to the distant base station. 2.

In this single hopping scheme the nodes use the same power level, since they have the same communication radius R. However the overall energy expenditure can be further reduced if nodes use power control, and this scheme is nothing but LEACH. On the other hand if we obtain that a > R, then the nodes must use multi-hop communication, and the quantity a/R is a good indicator of the hop count.

Since M-LEACH does not use power control for in-cluster communication, it performs worse in terms of energy than LEACH when it comes to pure single hop network. This is reflected in the energy term in . However when the optimum solution of M-LEACH is more in favor of multihop, i.e., a > R, then M-LEACH out-performs LEACH. This is especially true when the propagation loss exponent is large, or the size of the region is large. This is precisely the case for scenario II. The solution to (11) for scenario II from . Since for scenario II, k 1 = k 2 = 4, we cannot directly use the results from (1) and (2) for LEACH, since those were derived by assuming k 1 = 2 and k 2 = 4. However it is easy to generalize those results for any k 1 and k 2 . The values of m and E for LEACH in scenario II were obtained by appropriately re-deriving the expressions for m and E for k 1 = 4 and k 2 = 4. We note in that since for M-LEACH R is smaller than a, i.e., the communication radius is smaller than the cluster radius, multi-hop mode is the optimum mode of communication. We also note from Table II that the optimum communication radius R is greater than the minimum communication radius r required for connectivity, since to ensure connectivity with a probability of at least 0.99, we obtain r = 13m. Thus for scenario II M-LEACH clearly out-performs LEACH.  the overall network cost."

               "Having obtained results for M-LEACH, we use the results for the cost of a multi-hop heterogeneous network that have already been obtained in , and then we can determine the corresponding cost-difference function f (.) as in . We consider the settings of scenario II for this comparison, because the high propagation loss for in-cluster communication, and large size of the region favor multihopping. The approach for cost-based comparison is exactly similar to the single hop case. In this case we consider M-LEACH as the representative multi-hop homogeneous network as we have already seen in the previous section that for scenario II, M-LEACH is more energy efficient than LEACH. We consider a network with two types of nodes as the representative heterogeneous network. For this network and for the settings of scenario II, we obtain that the optimum radius of communication is?Ris? is?R = 93m, while for M-LEACH the optimum radius of communication is 70m (see ). We plot the cost difference between the two multi-hop networks in . In this case, E in1 /E along the x-axis is the battery energy of M-LEACH. Again the nature of the plot is similar to that of . As the relative cost of the hardware increases, the heterogeneous network is more cost effective than the homogeneous network. We also observe that for the range of1 /E that we consider, M-LEACH performs much better than its heterogeneous counterpart ) as compared to the performance of LEACH versus its heterogeneous counterpart ). This is especially the case when0 = 0.51 , where M-LEACH out-performs the heterogeneous multi-hop network. Thus in general to determine the most cost effective solution (homogeneous or heterogeneous, single hop or multi-hop), we must compare We first presented a cost based comparative analysis of single hop homogeneous and single hop heterogeneous networks. We took into account the hardware as well as the battery cost of the nodes in our analysis. We also proposed and analyzed a generalization of LEACH called M-LEACH (Multi-hop LEACH) which uses multi-hop communication within the cluster, and uses random and periodic cluster head rotation for load balancing. We showed that in many cases M-LEACH is more energy efficient than LEACH. Using M-LEACH as the representative multi-hop homogeneous network, we presented a cost based comparison of multi-hop homogeneous and multi-hop heterogeneous networks."
