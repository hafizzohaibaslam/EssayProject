               "Introduces the definition of rate of convergence for sequences and applies this to fixed-point root-finding iterative methods. Concludes with the development of a formula to estimate the rate of convergence for these methods when the actual root is not known. 1. Rate of Convergence Definition 1. If a sequence x 1 , x 2 ,. .. , x n converges to a value r and if there exist real numbers �� > 0 and �� �� 1 such that (1) lim n���� |x n+1 ? r| |x n ? r| �� = �� then we say that �� is the rate of convergence of the sequence. When �� = 1 we say the sequence converges linearly and when �� = 2 we say the sequence converges quadratically. If 1 < �� < 2 then the sequence exhibits superlinear convergence. 2. Fixed-Point Iterations Many root-finding methods are fixed-point iterations. These iterations have this name because the desired root r is a fixed-point of a function g(x), i.e., g(r) �� r. To be useful for finding roots, a fixed-point iteration should have the property that for x in some neighborhood of r, g(x) is closer to r than x is, leading to the iteration x n+1 = g(x n). Newton's method is an example of a fixed-point iteration since (2) x n+1 = g(x n), g(x) = x ? f (x) f (x) Theorem 1. Let r be a fixed-point of the iteration x n+1 = g(x n) and suppose that g (r) = 0. Then the iteration will have a linear rate of convergence. Proof. Using Taylor's Theorem for an expansion about fixed-point r we find (3) g(x) = g(r) + g (r)(x ? r) + g (��) 2 2 (x ? r) where �� is some value between x and r. Evaluating at x n and noting that x n+1 = g(x n) and g(r) = r we obtain x n+1 = r + g (r)(x n ? r) + g (��) 2 (x n ? r) 2 ."
