               "Kempe et al. [4] (KKT) showed the problem of influence maximization is NP-hard and a simple greedy algorithm guarantees the best possible approximation factor in PTIME. However, it has two major sources of inefficiency. First, finding the expected spread of a node set is #P-hard. Second, the basic greedy algorithm is quadratic in the number of nodes. The first source is tackled by estimating the spread using Monte Carlo simulation or by using heuristics [4, 6, 2, 5, 1, 3]. Leskovec et al. [6] proposed the CELF algorithm for tackling the second. In this work, we propose CELF++ and empirically show that it is 35-55% faster than CELF."

               "In influence maximization, we are given a network G with pairwise user influence probabilities (as edge labels) and a number k, and want to find a set S of k users (nodes) such that the expected spread of influence (spread for short) is maximized. In their seminal work , studied this problem, focusing on two fundamental propagation models -Linear Threshold Model (LT) and Independent Cascade Model (IC). They showed, under both models, the problem is NP-hard and a simple greedy algorithm successively selecting the node with the maximum marginal influence spread approximates the optimum solution within a factor of (1 ? 1/e). This is due to the nice properties of monotonocity and submodularity that the spread function exhibits under these models. In terms of spread, monotonocity says as more neighbors of some arbitrary node u gets active, the probability of u getting active increases. Submodularity says the marginal gain of a new node shrinks as the set grows. Function f is submodular iff",
               "A major limitation of the simple greedy algorithm is twofold: (i) The algorithm requires repeated computes of the spread function for various seed sets. The problem of computing the spread under both IC and LT models is #P-hard . As a result, Monte-Carlo simulations are run by KKT for sufficiently many times to obtain an accurate estimate, resulting in very long computation time. (ii) In each iteration, the simple greedy algorithm searches all the nodes in the graph as a potential candidate for next seed node. As a result, this algorithm entails a quadratic number of steps in terms of the number of nodes.",
               "Considerable work has been done on tackling the first issue, by using efficient heuristics for estimating the spread to register huge gains on this front. Relatively little work has been done on improving the quadratic nature of the greedy algorithm. The most notable work is , where submodularity is exploited to develop an efficient algorithm called CELF, based on a \"lazy-forward\" optimization in selecting seeds. The idea is that the marginal gain of a node in the current iteration cannot be better than its marginal gain in the previous iterations. CELF maintains a table u,u(S) sorted onu(S) in decreasing order, where S is the current seed set andu(S) is the marginal gain of u w.r.t S.u(S) is re-evaluated only for the top node at a time and if needed, the table is resorted. If a node remains at the top, it is picked as the next seed. Leskovec et al.",

               "In this work, we introduce CELF++ that further optimizes CELF by exploiting submodularity. Our experiments show that it improves the efficiency of CELF by 35-55%. Since the optimization introduced in CELF++ is orthogonal to the method used for estimating the spread, our idea can be combined with the heuristic approaches that are based on the greedy algorithm to obtain highly scalable algorithms for influence maximization."

In that sense, the extra overhead is relatively insignificant compared to the huge runtime gains we can achieve, as we will show from our experiments."

S over all users examined in the current iteration. The algorithm starts by building the heap Q initially (lines 2-4). Then, it continues to select seeds until the budget k is exhausted. As in CELF, we look at the root element u of Q and if u.f lag is equal to the size of the seed set, we pick u as the seed as this indicates that u.mg1 is actuallyu(S) (lines 6-9). The optimization of CELF++ comes from lines 10-11 where we update u.mg1 without recomputing the marginal gain. Clearly, this can be done since u.mg2 has already been computed efficiently w.r.t. the last seed node picked. If none of the above cases applies, we recompute the marginal gain of u (line 12-13).",

In these settings, we found that computing u.mg2 for all nodes in the first iteration results in large overhead. So, we apply CELF++ starting from the second iteration. Notice that the optimization behind CELF++ can be applied starting from any iteration. As can be seen, CELF++ is significantly faster than CELF. This is due to the fact that the average number of \"spread computations\" per iteration is significantly lower. Since we apply the optimization starting from the second iteration, we report the average number of nodes examined starting from the third iteration.",

We consider the IC model and assign the influence probability to arcs using two different settings, following previous works (e.g., see ).
