However, and perhaps more important, it also represents an important and essential set of techniques for constructing useful applications of data mining in a wide variety of real and important domains, especially those involving complex event detection from highly structured data. This article provides examples of problems and domains that require link mining techniques and discusses the technical requirements of these problems and domains.",

               "A central claim of this article is that link mining presents both challenges and opportunities. It presents challenges because data mining techniques for non-linked data are inadequate for similar problems with linked data and because the combinatorics of linked domains typically far exceed those of domains characterized by non-linked data. It presents opportunities because the structure of linked data provides both constraints on what can be inferred and additional information for inference than can be obtained from non-linked data.",
               "Many domains of interest are inherently relational. In fact, they are not just relational, but highly structured. By highly structured, we mean not only that there are semantically meaningful connections ? between entities of the same and different types, but also 1) that there are grouped entities that have as members other entities (of single or multiple types) and 2) that there are multiple abstraction hierarchies on these entities and their relationships. (Note that these two types of hierarchies correspond to the usual part-of and is-a predicates in many knowledge representation systems; the distinction between these two types of hierarchies is sometimes ignored in many link mining techniques, but is as important for learning and inference in link mining as it is in knowledge representation and reasoning.) At a high level of abstraction the application needs may be to correct inaccuracies and resolve uncertainties in the data, infer the existence of missing entities and links, identify higher-order entities that are not explicitly represented in the data, classify or score entities according to some attributes of interest, detect interesting subgraphs, detect changes or anomalies, and/or learn significant patterns. These rich domain structures provide a wide choice of representations; selecting an appropriate representation that enables all aspects of an application to be solved is a major challenge because the distinct techniques needed for particular aspects of an application often depend on different representational choices. Typically a database or set of databases is available. The databases may use incompatible data models, any or none of which may be appropriate for the link mining techniques. The combined databases may be thought of as a large heterogeneous graph; however, translating from a particular schema to a graphical data model is a one-to-many process. Often the data models are sparsely populated, contain uncertain and incorrect information, require inference to specify entities of interest -which may occur very rarely -from those that are"

One important application task in such domain typically consists of classifying inferred entities over time.",

Typically the former task is based on long-term role or trust type relationships while the latter is based on events. For example, an intelligence organization would want to keep track of certain people, places, events, and materials, infer the existence of organizations or (planned) activities, and classify (or score) these entities as threatening or not. A regulator might want to track activities by organizations and identify individuals who are at a high-risk for committing fraud.

Data mining is considered to be a particular step in this process, albeit the significant automated one in which algorithms are applied to extract the patterns. However, there is an inherent ambiguity in the use of the term \"pattern\" that is particularly important when one considers link mining applications. The patterns that are discovered are typically templates, or class-based. They contain variables that, when instantiated, provide examples of the pattern. The \"pattern\" is then used as the basis for inference to detect other instances by pattern matching. These other matches may also be referred to by the same term. Unfortunately, this dual meaning of the word pattern leads to confusion about what is data mining -i.e., pattern discovery -and what is the application -i.e., pattern detection. * Finally, in some domains, a third use of the term pattern is with respect to a frequently occurring (i.e., repeated) behavior of an individual entity. In this case, many instances of a pattern template are observed with the same instantiation of at least one of the variables.",
               "Accomplishing these goals requires many subsidiary problems to be solved first. In particular, the challenges of integrating data from different databases, resolving identities and consolidating transactions, inferring and acquiring missing data (entities and especially links), clustering entities into groups, inferring link strength and importance, and constructing unspecified features must all be solved to some degree.",
               "For such application tasks, the basic method for detection of entities or organizations of interest is pattern matching. However, patterns are rarely known exactly or specified fully. Even if a pattern of activity that is indicative of improper activity is fully specified, the data to support a full match may not all be available. And if the data are available, it may reflect a deviation from the specified pattern because the activity of interest is performed in different ways by different people. Supporting this pattern matching task is the task of discovering patterns. While pattern matching may be thought of as inference, pattern discovery is more properly thought of as learning. Pattern matching and pattern discovery are really complementary -a pattern is discovered because of the existence of many instances, and a pattern instance is matched from the pattern template.",
               "There is also an inherent ambiguity with respect to the term \"link\" that occurs in many circumstances, but especially in discussions with people whose background and research interests are in the database community. In the database community, especially the subcommunity that uses the well-known entity-relationship (ER) model, a \"link\" is a connection between two records in two different tables. This is important because in this model a link is not identical to a real-world relationship. The real world relationship is modeled by having a corresponding table, or relation. Links are abstract connections between tables that refer to the co-occurrence of the same value in fields of two different relations. Links can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-tomany. So, for example, a link might connect a \"person\" record to the person's account or to that person's address.",

In the intelligence community a \"link\" typically refers to some real world connection between two entities. The difference between these two communities' use of the term \"link\" ; the database use of the term describes the lines in the top and left of the figure, while the domain use of the term describes the lines in the bottom right.

This representation is efficient for typical database query operations. However, it is inefficient for the types of queries typically performed in link analysis, such as finding all paths between two entities or finding all entities within a certain distance of a specified entity. It is also inflexible with respect to the addition of new entity or link types. Link analysis applications typically require the ability to refocus on different link types or different sets of entities, as they concentrate on detecting, analyzing, and displaying different subsets of data with their full connectivity structure. Link analysis representations often are based on two tables, one for entities and one for links, with the semantics of the data types determined by the entries in these tables rather than being specified in the data model. This type of representation is inefficient for aggregate queries but extremely flexible for interactive queries on reasonably sized datasets and difficult to update. illustrates the two-table data structure typically used in link analysis tools.

Link diagrams are often constructed painstakingly by a manual process, based on information that is collected incrementally as the focus of a particular investigation.

Link discovery technology would be developed to enable the ability to discover related entities, additional attributes, and other relevant relationships from a starting point of a set of entities, relationships, and attributes potentially relevant to a scenario of interest. Pattern learning technology will be developed to enable learning from examples of instances of scenarios of interest patterns or models which will facilitate the extraction and discovery of additional instances of scenarios of interest.",
               "The resulting program was the first large-scale effort to focus research on the problem of linked and structured data. Contracts were awarded in late summer of 2001, and interest in this area increased drastically shortly thereafter following the attacks of . EELD's goals were to increase the size of datasets that could be analyzed by several orders of magnitude over the life of the program on an increasing set of link mining tasks. EELD was responsible for much of the progress in link mining between ; for example, 6 of the 11 papers presented in were from work funded as precursors to EELD as was much work reported in other workshops and conferences during this time. All three winners of the KDD-Cup 2003 task 4 (open task) competition were EELD funded researchers. 5."

               "Real applications typically have many requirements, with pattern discovery and pattern detection at their core. Other requirements arise from characteristics of the environment; e.g., the need to combine data from multiple sources, the need to compute certain derived attributes for use by the pattern discovery and pattern detection algorithms, the need to support multiple analysts, the need to record and audit system activities, the need to sort data into distinct threads of interest, the need to support detection of patterns that may occur over long time periods, the need to visualize patterns (in both senses of the term), the need to both discover and detect patterns that are continually changing, the need to protect the identity of entities until a particular level of belief in their interestingness is supported and, perhaps, proper approvals are obtained, the need to allow for multiple competing hypotheses, the need to allow for refutation of previously asserted evidence, the need to allow for frequent tuning between false positives and false negatives, the need to support both comprehensive review of all data based on approved patterns and ad-hoc review based on particular external indicators, the need to support what-if analyses by individuals, the need to support organizational workflow processes, the need to operate continuously and perhaps autonomously on incrementally arriving massive data streams, and perhaps others.",
               "representation of entities and links. Such a language would also allow for the representation of pattern templates and for specifying matches between the templates and their instantiations. The language would have to accept an arbitrary database schema as input, with a specified mapping between relations in the database and fundamental link types in the language. It would have to compile into efficient and rapidly executable database queries. It would need to be able to represent grouped entities and multiple abstraction hierarchies and reason at all levels. It would have to enable the creation of new schema elements in the database to represent newly discovered concepts. It would need to represent both pattern templates and pattern instances, and to have a mechanism for tracking matches between the two. It would have to have constructs for representing fundamental relationships such as part-of, is-a, and connected-to (the most generic link relationship), as well as perhaps other high-level link types such as temporal relationships (e.g., before, after, during, overlapping, etc.), geo-spatial relationships, organizational relationships, trust relationships, and activities and events. The toolkit would include at least one and possibly many pattern matchers. It would require tools for creating and editing patterns. It would have to include visualizations for many different types of structured data. It would need mechanisms for handling uncertainty and confidence. It would have to track the dependence of any conclusion (e.g., pattern match or discovered pattern) back to the underlying data, and perhaps incorporate backtracking so the impact of data corrections could be detected. It would need configuration management tools to track the history of discovered and matched patterns. It would need workflow mechanisms to support multiple users in an organizational structure. It would need mechanisms for ingesting domain-specific knowledge. It would have to be able to deal with multiple data types including text and imagery. And it would have to be able to rapidly incorporate new link mining techniques as they are developed. Finally, it would need to include mechanisms for maximum privacy protection.",
               "Given the progress that has occurred in the past decade and the challenges outlined in section 2, what remains to be done? Rather than focus on the research issues that would enable more effective solutions to particular link mining tasks, we discuss the overall needs to construct effective link mining applications. To address this question, it is helpful to imagine a complete \"link mining toolkit.\" What would such a toolkit look like? It would have to solve all the application issues discussed earlier and it would have to do so in a manner that enabled it to be operated as part of an integrated application. Such a link-mining toolkit would have to, at a minimum, enable the exchange of data and models between different link mining techniques. To build integrated applications, it would require not only a common representation for linked data but also meta-level descriptors of the inputs, outputs, transformations, and assumptions, for each of the included link mining techniques so they could be used in various combinations to solve the different aspects needed by an application. For realtime applications it might also require a control architecture that enabled automatic dynamic algorithm selection and application, as well as an ability to evaluate the quality of results from any particular technique. And it would have to be tightly integrated with underlying databases management systems."

The construction of successful and useful link mining applications is still very much an ad-hoc enterprise.",
               "Choosing the right representation for the underlying data and concepts is still the key, much more important than the particular choice of algorithms for scoring or classification. Designing an effective architecture to support all necessary functions of an integrated application is also a key to success."
