               "Social networks have become a popular medium for people to communicate and distribute ideas, content, news and advertisements. Social content annotation has naturally emerged as a method of categorization and filtering of online information. The unrestricted vocabulary users choose from to annotate content has often lead to an explosion of the size of space in which search is performed. In this article, we propose latent topic models as a principled way of reducing the dimensionality of such data and capturing the dynamics of collaborative annotation process. We propose three generative processes to model latent user tastes with respect to resources they annotate with metadata. We show that latent user interests combined with social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users can significantly improve social link prediction in the online music social media site Last.fm. Most link prediction methods suffer from the high class imbalance problem, resulting in low precision and/or recall. In contrast, our proposed classification schemes for social link recommendation achieve high precision and recall with respect to not only the dominant class (non-existence of a link), but also with respect to sparse positive instances, which are the most vital in social tie prediction."

               "Social networking sites have offered Internet users a novel way to organize their online digital content and share content with other users. In general, users of social media sites contribute content which is not restricted to one media type (e.g., documents, photos, URLs). Depending on the social media site, users can annotate content using descriptive text (e.g., title and description of photos in Flickr 1 ) or with metadata (i.e., tags). User-generated content mostly comprises of free, unstructured text, which often does not adhere to grammatical and syntactical rules, contains slag terms and abbreviations and is often of restricted length (e.g., 140 characters in Twitter 2 ). To improve online content organization, categorization, search and filtering, users have adopted tags (or hashtags). The ability of users to select tags from an unrestricted vocabulary has led to the creation of personalized taxonomies, offering greater malleability and adaptability in information organization than formal classification systems, which impose users with the restriction to annotate content based on predefined keywords. Even though tags tend to be very inconsistent between various users, resulting in a large number of polysemous and synonymous annotations , hierarchies of mediated community knowledge emerge .",
               "In current social tagging systems organization, classification and search tend to be rather simplistic in nature, often relying on keyword-based retrieval algorithms or aggregated results stemming from collaborative filtering techniques . Probabilistic models have been successfully used in discovering the set of hidden topics that were responsible for generating a collection of documents (e.g., ). In this work, we describe three unsupervised models of online social tagging systems as a principled mechanism to address issues of synonymy, polysemy and tag sparseness. Our probabilistic models capture the generative primitives behind online content annotation, while at the same time extract information about users' latent interests and hidden topics from online, large-scale social tagging systems.",
               "Online social media sites users' rich activities reveal crucial information about their behavior and interests. Users' interaction with online content can be effectively captured with tripartite graphs . The models we present in this article mine users' latent interests from their interactions with online content, instead of relying to user-generated profiles, which may be incomplete or obsolete. We benefit from such modeling of users' latent interests into providing answers to a broad range of important queries, such as which users have similar interests (i.e., community detection) and which other users a user would be mostly interested in (i.e., social link prediction). Link prediction in social networks is a challenging problem, as social networking data are inherently noisy and heterogeneous. One key assumption in sociology is the theory of homophily , which postulates that people who have similar characteristics tend to form ties. Moreover, it is likely that the stronger the tie, the higher the similarity . Link prediction models that estimate tie strength from entity attributes and graph structure [Lu and or interaction activity and user's profile similarity have been proposed . Such approaches assume the existence of a latent model that captures the causality of the underlying social process by considering relationship strength to be the hidden effect of user profiles similarities and interactions between users. In our work, we first examine which users' activity (annotations, resources, or annotation of resources) is the most discriminative in predicting social ties. We show that users' latent interests can be particularly beneficial to social link prediction and we model the process of social link creation as the hidden effect of such latent profiles combined with network features. Particularly, we propose a framework to integrate our modeling of social annotations with network proximity. The proposed approach consists of two steps: (1) discovering salient topics that characterize users, resources and annotations; and (2) enhancing the recommendation power of such models by incorporating social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users.",
               "The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows. First, we propose a novel generative modeling of tripartite graphs in social media sites with three probabilistic models that simultaneously capture users' interests with respect to annotation of resources and hidden topics. We provide a systematic comparison of our models in the task of uncovering hidden topics and we illustrate numerous applications. Consequently, we propose several scalable methods for learning to classify social links, based on latent semantics and local network structure. We compare our methods against state of the art social link prediction techniques on a real-world dataset.",
               "The outline of the article is as follows: Section 2 describes the basic structure of tripartite graphs and Section 3 introduces our three probabilistic models for tripartite graph generation. Section 4 briefly describes a social link prediction technique based on semantic similarity of user-generated metadata. We use this technique as a baseline to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models in the task of social tie recommendation. Section 5 discusses our four scalable social link classification schemes, which exploit latent semantics and local network structure. Section 8 evaluates our clustering schemes on a real-world dataset and contrasts it to other approaches. Section 9 summarizes previous work, while Section 10 concludes with a discussion of the implications of our findings and directions of future work."

In order to exploit implicit relationships between users, tripartite graph models have also been proposed , as shown in .",
               "Tripartite graphs offer a mechanism to describe and capture users' behavior and interests in terms of their activities. A tripartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into three disjoint sets: 1) a set of actors (e.g., users) A = {a 1 , ..., a A }, 2) a set of concepts (e.g., tags) C = {c 1 , ..., c C } and 3) a set of resources (e.g., photos) R = {r 1 , ..., r R }. A resource rR is annotated with a set of concepts c rC of size N r (similarly created, used, bookmarked or shared), by a set of actors a rA. A collection of R resources is then represented as a concatenation of individual concept vectors c, having N = R r=1 N r concepts in total. It is possible to cluster vertices that belong to any of the three disjoint sets of a tripartite model so as to extract emergent semantics. Tripartite graphs can this way be reduced into three bipartite graphs, which model associations between actors and concepts (bipartite graph AC), concepts and resources (bipartite graph CR), and actors and resources (bipartite graph AR). Bipartite graphs are easier to comprehend and work with but the reduction process discards higher dimensional links between the three sets, which could otherwise be extremely useful in the analysis of the social network at hand. A bipartite graph can be further reduced to produce two simple, weighted graphs. For example, the bipartite graph of actors and concepts (AC) may be reduced into two graphs, one for actors (graph A) and one for concepts (graph C). In this case, the reduced graph A models relationships between actors, weighted by the number of times two actors have used same concepts.",
               "The creator of a resource is often considered to be its owner, but many actors may use, bookmark or share a resource, thus becoming \"owners\" themselves. Further, many actors may collectively annotate a resource, socially contributing to its set of concepts. We consider artists in Last.fm 3 as resources, which are annotated with tags. Tags become concepts in our modeling. More complex hierarchical Bayesian models can be designed if more types of resources and concepts are considered. The models we describe below can be naturally extended to accommodate other resources and annotation types, such as annotations of Flickr photos, or descriptive text of Youtube videos.",
               "Users annotate resources by choosing tags from an uncontrolled vocabulary according to their style and interests. Resources of the same nature (i.e., topic) may be tagged with different keywords, which may have similar meaning (e.g., synonyms) or with linguistic variations of the same keyword due to the uncontrolled vocabulary (e.g., \"lac\" as opposed to \"laclippers\"). Conversely, the same keyword can be used to annotate resources of different nature due to polysemy. For example, \"apple\" may be used to describe a story about farmers' market or about a new i-phone product. We use probabilistic models as a mechanism to address such issues of synonymy, polysemy and tag sparseness and effectively model tripartite graphs in order to capture users' interests in social networks."

The process of resource annotation can be described as a stochastic process. A group of users a r , which for the purposes of estimation we assume is observed, collectively annotate resource r. For each resource annotation a user a is chosen uniformly at random. Based on user a's interests and the nature of the resource, a set of topics is selected.

We extend this approach by considering resources and metadata to represent users' interests instead of documents consisting of words.

Precisely, average similarity is large for large values of common friends, however, it drops as the number of common friends decreases. Large fluctuations in this case are visible for large number of common friends due to the small number of users over whom averages are computed. Average similarity under the URC model is relatively constant in this case, when the number of common neighbors is in the range between 1 and 25, even though a small increasing trend is visible.

Based on the analysis presented above we observe that hidden topics proximity alone is not sufficient to accurately predict social ties. However, our work demonstrates that the addition of local network features to latent semantics greatly improves performance, often by a considerable margin."

AUC quantifies prediction accuracy and tests how much better a classifier is than pure chance, while at the same time measuring its overall ability to rank all missing connections (positive class), which are the hardest to predict, over nonexistent ones (negative class). AUC evaluates classification performance across the entire range of decision thresholds, providing a good performance overview when the operating condition for the classifier is unknown or the classifier is expected to be used in situations with significantly different class distributions. We randomly split our dataset into two disjoint sets, such that we retain 10%, 25%, 50%, and 75% of the data for training and the rest for testing. The evaluation consists of selecting pairs of users, computing their similarity and adding links between users in decreasing order of their topical similarity. The pairs of users with highest similarity are those we predict to be most likely tied. Particularly, we randomly sample 12, 716 pairs of users, out of which 50% are true links and 50% are negative samples. For each predicted social link, we check the actual social network to see if the prediction is correct. Our \"Ensemble Classification Scheme\" (Scheme D) produces only class labels without assigning score values, hence we exclude it from our comparison. This leaves us with two Schemes, A and C.",
               "The choice to select pairs of users randomly stems from the size of our dataset, which makes an exhaustive comparative evaluation infeasible. For the calculation of AUC values for the two baselines, we use the complete dataset instead of splitting it into disjoint training and testing sets. Note that this strategy may bias the evaluation in favor of the baselines, which have a complete view of the dataset for their similarity calculations. Therefore, our evaluation is a conservative choice in that it does not unfairly help our proposed schemes (in fact there might be a bias against them).",

Further, different datasets may result in different optimal models. shows the results. The observation of AUC values further validates that our classification schemes act as proper ranking functions for all three models. Scheme A, which combines latent topics with local structure (number of common neighbors), performs better than Scheme C, which only considers latent similarity. Further, as the fraction of observed edges increases, the classification accuracy of our schemes improves significantly. When 20% or more of the original dataset is provided for training, our schemes outperform the baselines, often by a considerable factor."

Our model is an adaptation of the author-topic model proposed by Rosen-Zvi et al. . The objective of their work was to provide a generative process for document creation, capable of recovering hidden topics in a document corpus. We are extending their model to resources of any type (not just documents) and annotations (instead of words). The social process of annotation generation is unknown. It is not intuitive that such framework would perform as well in this context. Social tagging systems have been well studied, leading to a vast literature around this area. Gupta et al. summarized different techniques employed to study various aspects of tagging. studied the basic dynamics behind tagging in the social bookmarking site del.icio.us and proposed a collaborative tagging model based on preferential attachment and informational value. We instead take a probabilistic, generative approach that accurately models collaborative annotation in online social media.",

In both works, there is only one \"tagger\" per document, whereas our model captures the social aspect of tagging, allowing a mixture of users to collaboratively contribute in the annotation process. Therefore, our approach is more general and the problem we study more difficult. proposed a general model to find hidden structures (local clusters and global community structures) from a k-partite graph.

Taskar et al. proposed a relational Markov network framework to define a joint probabilistic model over the entire graph-entity attributes and links, assuming a Markov dependency (the label of one node depends on its neighbors' labels).

Sun et al. proposed PathSim to measure the similarity among same type objects in heterogeneous networks based on symmetric meta paths (sequence of rela-tions between different object types). However, in online social networks many valuable paths are asymmetric and the relatedness of different-typed objects is also meaningful. Hence, PathSim is not suitable in this context. Further, there is no standard procedure to follow in order to explicitly specify path combinations to define meta paths. Typical users do not necessarily posses the amount of domain knowledge required to define meta paths. Choosing the best path by experimentation or learning it from training examples leads to a state space explosion, rendering this approach impractical. Davis et al. proposed a neighborhood multi-relational link prediction approach based on triad census, trivially extended to heterogeneous networks. Its weighted version is equivalent to weighted common neighbors. Prediction scores are calculated individually for each link type of interest, ignoring latent influence due to meta paths. Instead, our approach combines structural features with latent user interests, while at the same time provides a generative model of the heterogeneous network formation and evolution.",

For applications where models with n-ary relations with n > 3 need to be considered, tensor factorization techniques are required. provide a recent overview of leading approaches. Unfortunately, the straightforward application of higher-order tensor models becomes problematic due to computational requirements and data sparsity.",

Their hierarchical system exploits latent user interests based on user profiles, treating users as documents. In this sense, our work is a generalization of their approach, while at the same time requiring significantly less amount of training data to achieve high precision and recall. Further, in their small-scaled experiments, they only considered ROC-AUC analysis. We, in contract, address scalability issues, considering thousands of users who may be arbitrarily connected, resulting in million potential friendships.

In particular, we showed how to exploit latent user interests in conjunction with structural features to significantly improve social link prediction in the online music social media site Last.fm. We showed that similarity of interests alone does not trigger the creation of a social link. Instead, we showed how to achieve high prediction performance using four classifiers, which jointly exploit users' interests similarity and their local network proximity. We plan to further validate our results by examining dynamic social networks. Taking into account temporality, we will be able to better understand if the combination of taste and local network similarity indeed drives tie formation or if conversely, tie formation results in taste alignment and local network densification. While most link prediction methods suffer from the high class imbalance problem resulting in low precision and/or recall solutions, our proposed methods achieve high precision and recall for highly imbalanced classes.",

We also plan to establish a mechanism which will automatically identify the most discriminative latent topics and will discard uninformative resources and metadata. Our results have important implications for the design of social media sites. Besides link recommendation and prediction, our methods can be easily adapted to facilitate analysis of trending topics and users' latent interests, resource and tag recommendations and categorization, classification and filtering of online information."
