               "Social networks often serve as a medium for the diffusion of ideas or innovations. An individual's decision whether to adopt a product or innovation will be highly dependent on the choices made by the individual's peers or neighbors in the social network. In this work, we study the game of innovation diffusion with multiple competing innovations such as when multiple companies market competing products using viral marketing. Our first contribution is a natural and mathematically tractable model for the diffusion of multiple innovations in a network. We give a (1?1/e) approximation algorithm for computing the best response to an opponent's strategy, and prove that the \"price of competition\" of this game is at most 2. We also discuss \"first mover\" strategies which try to maximize the expected diffusion against perfect competition. Finally , we give an FPTAS for the problem of maximizing the influence of a single player when the underlying graph is a tree."

               "Social networks are graphs of individuals and their relationships, such as friendships, collaborations, or advice seeking relationships. In deciding whether to adopt an innovation (such as a political idea or product), individuals will frequently be influenced, explicitly or implicitly, by their social contacts. In order to effectively employ viral marketing , i.e., marketing via \"word-of-mouth\" recommendations, it is thus essential for companies to identify \"opinion leaders\" to target, in the hopes that influencing them will lead to a large cascade of further recommendations. More formally, the influence maximization problem is the following: Given a probabilistic model for influence, determine a set A of k individuals yielding the largest expected cascade. The formalization of influence maximization as an optimization problem is due to Domingos and Richardson , who modeled influence by an arbitrary Markov random field, and gave heuristics for maximization. The first provable approximation guarantees are given in .",
               "In this paper, we extend past work by focusing on the case when multiple innovations are competing within a social network. This scenario will frequently arise in the real world: multiple companies with comparable products will vie for sales with competing word-of-mouth cascades; similarly, many innovations face active opposition also spreading by word of mouth. We propose a natural generalization of the independent cascade model to multiple competing influences (see Section 2 for details). Our model extends Hotelling's model of competition , and is related to competitive facility location and Voronoi games . We first study second-mover strategies and equilibria of the resulting activation game and show that: Theorem 1. The last agent i to commit to a set S i for initial activation can efficiently find a (1 ? 1/e) approximation to the optimal S i .",

Finally, we give an FPTAS for maximizing the influence of a single player on bidirected trees, even when the edges in opposite directions have different probabilities. proved that the general version of influence maximization is NP-complete, and we conjecture it is so even for arborescences directed into a root."

               "The social network is represented as a directed graph G = (V, E). Following the independent cascade model , each edge e = (u, v)E has an activation probability p e . Each node can be either inactive or active; in the latter case, it is assigned a color denoting the influence for which it is active (intuitively, the product that the node has adopted). To avoid tie-breaking for simultaneous activation attempts by multiple neighbors, we augment the model by a notion of activation time for each activation attempt. When node u becomes active at time t, it attempts to activate each currently inactive neighbor v. If the activation attempt from u on v succeeds, v will become active, of the same color as u, at time t + T uv , where the T uv are independent and exponentially distributed continuous random variables. Subsequently, v will try to activate inactive neighbors, and so forth. Thus, a node always has the color of the first neighbor succeeding in activating it.",
               "In the influence maximization game, each of b players selects a set S i of at most k i nodes. A node selected by multiple players will take the color of one of the players uniformly at random. Then, with S i being active for influence i, the process unfolds as described above until no new activations occur. Letting T 1 , . . . , T b be the active sets at that point, the goal of each player i is to maximize E [|T i |]. Player i is indifferent between strategies S i and Si if their expected gain is the same. In particular, the game is thus not a zero-sum game. Simple examples show that in general, this game has no pure strategy Nash Equilibria; however, it does have mixed-strategy Nash Equilibria.",

               "Proof. We obtain a deterministic equivalent of the activation process by choosing independently if each edge e = (u, v) will constitute a successful activation attempt by u on v (a biased coin flip with probability p e ), as well as the activation time T e , beforehand. Then, we consider running the (now deterministic) activation process using these outcomes and delays.",
               "If node u has color j, and activates node v successfully, we color the edge (u, v) with color j. A path P is called a color-j path if all its edges have color j. Then, a node u ends up colored with color j iff there is a color-j path from some node in S j to u.",
               "Conditioned on any outcome of all random choices as well as all S j , j = i, the set of nodes reachable along color-i paths from S i is the union of all nodes reachable from any one node of S i . Thus, if S i ? Si , the set of nodes reachable from S i + v, but not from S i , is a superset of those reachable from Si + v, but not from Si (by monotonicity). Thus, given fixed outcomes of all random choices and S j , j = i, the number of nodes reachable from S i is a monotone and submodular function of S i . Being a non-negative linear combination of submodular functions (with coefficients equal to the probabilities of the outcomes of the random choices), the objective function of player i is thus also monotone and submodular.",
               "The above lemma implies that for the last player to commit to a strategy, the greedy algorithm of iteratively adding a node with largest marginal gain is within a factor (1 ? 1/e) of the best response (see ), thus proving Theorem 1. Second, as the expected total number of active nodes at the end is also a monotone submodular function of S := j S j , the game meets the requirements of a valid utility system as defined by Vetta . We can apply Theorem 3.4 of to obtain that the expected total number of nodes activated in any Nash Equilibrium is at least half the number activated by the best solution with a single player controlling all of the i b i initial activations. This proves Theorem 2."

               "We now consider first mover strategies in a duopoly, with 2 players called \"red\" and \"blue\". The following variant of the competitive influence maximization problem is motivated by its similarity both to the case of multiple disjoint directed lines (discussed briefly below) and to a fair division problem: Given n lines of lengths ? 1 , . . . , ? n , the red player first gets to make any k cuts, creating k + n pieces whose lengths sum up to the original lengths. The blue player picks the k largest segments (\"blue pieces\") and the red player gets the next-largest min(n, k) segments (\"red pieces\").",

Then, we obtain the following recurrence relation, which turns into a dynamic program in the standard way.",

Second, partially used line segments can be converted to completely used line segments by adding the unused part to an existing blue segment (if it exists) or to an existing red segment (if no blue piece exists). The latter may entice the blue player to take a red piece. But this frees up a formerly blue piece (of size at least c) to be picked up by the red player.",

If the optimal solution contains an unevenly cut line with red and blue pieces, we increase the sizes of all red pieces and decrease the sizes of all blue pieces until the line is cut evenly. As before, the red player's gain cannot be reduced by the blue player switching to a different piece, because any new piece the red player may obtain after the blue player switches will have size at least c.",

In the former case, the slight difference is that the \"leftmost\" piece of any line is not available to the red player. These extensions are deferred to the full version due to space constraints."
