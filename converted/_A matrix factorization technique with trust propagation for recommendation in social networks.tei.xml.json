               "Cold start users are one of the most important challenges in recommender systems. Since cold start users are more dependent on the social network compared to users with more ratings, the effect of using trust propagation gets more important for cold start users. Moreover, in many real life social rating networks a very large portion of users do not express any ratings, and they only participate in the social network. Hence, using only the observed ratings does not allow to learn the user features. The SocialMF model forces the user feature vectors to be close to those of their neighbors to be able to learn the latent user features for users with no or very few ratings.",

We present a new In recommender systems we have a set of users U = {u 1 , ... u N } and a set of items I = {i 1 , ... i M }. The ratings expressed by users on items are given in a rating matrix R = [Ru,i]NM . In this matrix Ru,i denotes the rating of user u on item i. Ru,i can be any real number, but often ratings are integers in the range . In this paper, without loss of generality, we map the ratings 1, ..., 5 to the interval by normalizing the ratings. In a social rating network, each user u has a set Nu of direct neighbors and tu,v denotes the value of social trust u has on v as a real number in . Zero means no trust and one means full trust. Binary trust networks are the most common trust networks (Amazon 4 , eBay 5 , ...). The trust values are given in a matrix T = [Tu,v]NN . Non-zero cells Tu,v in T denote the existence of a social relation from u to v. Note that T is asymmetric in general.",

The SocialMF model learns to tune the latent features of these users close to their neighbors. So, despite not having any expressed ratings, the feature vectors of these users will be learnt to be close to their neighbors. Basically, the social trust relations among users is an observed dependency among the feature vectors of users. It should be noted that since evaluating the learnt features is typically based on the withheld observed ratings, we are currently not able to evaluate the features learnt for users with no expressed ratings."

To show how significant our gain is, note that the gain of STE over the baseline MF method is 2.5% and the gain of SocialMF over STE is more than 2 times that gain. As another evidence for the significance of these RMSE reductions, note that in the Netflix prize competition , there was a $1 Million reward for a reduction of the RMSE by 10%.",

Larger values ofT in the objective function of equation 12 indicate more impact of the social network on the behavior of users.

However, very large values ofT lead to a model in which having feature vectors close to those of direct neighbors dominating having lower squared error in the training phase.",

Again, SocialMF clearly outperforms existing methods. In Flixster, the improvement of the RMSE for SocialMF over STE is 5% which more than 3 times of the gain of STE over baseline MF (1.5%)."

Another explanation for the better results on Flixster could be that it Flixster is a richer dataset since there are more social relations and ratings per user in Flixster compared to Epinions. Some users in a social rating network express a lot of ratings, but most users express a few ratings. We consider users who have expressed less than 5 ratings as cold start users . In both Flixster and Epinions more than 50% of users are cold start users . Hence efficiency of any recommendation algorithm for cold start users becomes very important. : RMSE values on cold start users (K=5).",

Also if a user has not expressed any ratings, his feature vectors can be learnt as long as he is connected to the social network via a social relation. Thus SocialMF deals better with cold start users than existing methods. Note that if a cold start user is not connected to the social network, then social network based approaches have no additional information to improve the quality of recommendation for that user.",

This work suggests several interesting directions for future work. We want to extend the model to handle negative trust relations, since some social networks allow users to express distrust towards other users. In this paper, we performed experiments on different ranges ofT . As future work, we investigate the possibility of tuningT automatically. Finally, cold start items have not been addressed in this paper, and it should be explored how the model can be extended so that the feature vectors of cold start items are also learnt efficiently."
