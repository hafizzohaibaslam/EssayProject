               "Link prediction in complex networks is an important issue in graph mining. It aims at estimating the likelihood of the existence of links between nodes by the know network structure information. Currently, most link prediction algorithms based on local information consider only the individual characteristics of common neighbors. In this paper, first, we study the link prediction results as the change of the exponent on the degree of common neighbors, and find some regular pattern between different networks and different exponent. After that, we come up with a new algorithm exploiting the interactions between common neighbors, namely Individual Attraction Index. To reduce the time complexity, we design a simple edition, called Simple Individual Attraction Index. We compare nine well-known local information metrics on eight real networks. The result proves well the best overall performance of these two new algorithms. of small world networks to assess confidence for individual protein-protein interactions. Kleinberg and Liben-Nowell [8] empirically investigated the similarity-based prediction indices for large scientific collaboration networks. In 2008, Clauset et al. [9] proposes a hierarchical structure method to link prediction, this algorithm has good result in the network which has obvious hierarchy. In addition, Lichtenwalter et al. [10] proposed a supervised learning framework for link prediction. It uses the classification algorithm to predict links. In recent years, link prediction based on node similarity has become a research focus."

               "Link prediction in data mining has attracted increasing attention from complex networks communities, it refers to how to predict the possibility of the existence of a link between two nodes based on observed links and the attributes of two nodes. Link prediction includes: (1) one is the prediction of missing links in sampling network such as the World Wide Web network; (2) the other is the prediction of links that may exist in the future of evolving networks such as the phone call network. This paper focuses on the problem of predicting the unknown links.",
               "Recently, the link prediction based on node similarity take more and more focus on the degree of common neighbors. The different functions on the degree of common neighbor have an effect on the accuracy rate of link prediction. To know the relationship between the variation of different degree functions and different networks, in this paper, we make an intensive experiment by changing the exponent of the degree of common neighbors. At the same time, traditional link prediction algorithms based on node similarity only consider the number of common neighbors between two nodes predicted and the degree of common neighbors, and do not study the relationships between common neighbors in depth. This paper proposes a new link prediction algorithm, Individual Attraction Index (IA), and its simple edition, Simple Individual Attraction Index (SIA). The two algorithms take not only the common neighbors themselves but also the impact of the small network formed by the common neighbors. The new algorithms achieved good results comparing other nine well-known nodesimilarity algorithms.",

Popescul and Ungar designed a regression model to predict citations made in scientific literature based not only on the citation graph, but also on authorship, journal information and content. Taskar et al. used the relational Markov network algorithm to predict missing links in social network, in which the welldefined attributes of each node are exploited. Madadhain et al.",

The content and attribute information are generally not available and thus the applications of the above algorithms are strongly limited, although the usage of external information can somewhat enhance the algorithmic accuracy . Goldberg and Roth exploited the neighborhood cohesiveness property This paper is organized as follows: The second section gives a brief description about link prediction and the evaluation, also the datasets and other nine known metrics used in the paper; Section 3 try to find the relationship between the exponent on the degree of common neighbors; Section 4 and Section 5 propose two new link prediction metrics; In Section 6, eight real data sets are used to compare the experimental results of different metrics; The last section is a brief summary of the paper."
