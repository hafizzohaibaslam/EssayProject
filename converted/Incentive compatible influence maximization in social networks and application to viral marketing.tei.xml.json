               "Information diffusion and influence maximization are important and extensively studied problems in social networks. Various models and algorithms have been proposed in the literature in the context of the influence maximization problem. A crucial assumption in all these studies is that the influence probabilities are known to the social planner. This assumption is unrealistic since the influence probabilities are usually private information of the individual agents and strategic agents may not reveal them truthfully. Moreover, the influence probabilities could vary significantly with the type of the information flowing in the network and the time at which the information is propagating in the network. In this paper, we use a mechanism design approach to elicit influence probabilities truthfully from the agents. We first work with a simple model, the influencer model , where we assume that each user knows the level of influence she has on her neighbors but this is private information. In the second model, the influencer-influencee model , which is more realistic, we determine influence probabilities by combining the probability values reported by the influencers and influencees. In the context of the first model, we present how VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanisms could be used for truthfully eliciting the influence probabilities. Our main contribution is to design a scoring rule based mechanism in the context of the influencer-influencee model. In particular, we show the incentive compatibility of the mechanisms when the scoring rules are proper and propose a reverse weighted scoring rule based mechanism as an approSocial networks are widespread and indeed provide an effective medium to propagate information and to market and advertise products. Examples of online social networks include facebook, twitter, linked in, orkut, etc. A social network, in a natural way, could be represented in the form of a graph in which an individual is represented as a node and there is an edge between two individuals if they are associated with each other. * Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, mail -mayur@csa.iisc.ernet.in ? Professor, Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, mail -hari@csa.iisc.ernet.in Consider a situation in which a company has designed a new gaming console which it wants to market on a social network. As a marketing strategy, the company can select a small set of influential users to whom it provides the product for free. If these users like the product, then they will recommend it to their friends. These friends could get influenced by the users and will perhaps buy the product. Some of these friends will in turn recommend the product to their friends, leading to a marketing cascade. An online social network is an effective medium for launching such a marketing campaign because it has much information about the users as well as the relationship graph of users. The choice of an initial set of users is critical here because these initially selected users will decide the expected number of users that would get influenced ultimately. An important problem in this context is the influence maximization problem -given a social network graph and influence probabilities on each edge, how do we select a small set of initial users so as to maximize Thus, the influence probabilities can vary drastically with the product being marketed, the time at which the recommendation is made, and perhaps many other factors. Building robust and accurate models for estimating the influence probabilities from the currently available data in online social networks is a difficult task. The best way to know the influence probabilities accurately is to elicit them truthfully from the users themselves. However, the users need not reveal the influence probabilities truthfully due to strategic reasons. For example, a user might misreport by projecting a higher level of influence on her friends in order to become a part of the initially active set. The success of a viral marketing strategy or in general influence maximization is critically dependent on the initially chosen target set. This in turn depends on the accuracy of the influence probabilities. More generally, predicting information diffusion in a social network critically depends on knowing the influence probabilities.",

               "In this paper we address the influence maximization problem in an incomplete information setting in which, influence probabilities are the private information. Our objective in this paper is to extract influence probabilities accurately using a mechanism design approach.",
               "The current models for information diffusion process assume that the social planner knows the influence probabilities accurately. There are many reasons why this assumption is not true in practice. Consider an example, say a seller wants to sell a newly released book by some author and another seller wants to sell a tennis racket. Both the sellers decide to use viral marketing on a popular online social network to market these products. To do this the seller will have to find the values of influence probabilities on each edge and find the influential set of nodes to initiate the cascade process. Consider a typical user u and her set of neighbors on the social network. See . The influence probability of u on each neighbor for a product say book need not be the same for another product say tennis racket. This is perhaps because u is a novice tennis player but is good at English literature and her friends know this, however, this particular information is not available on this social networking site. Hence her friends will be influenced more by her recommendation of a novel to them than a tennis racket."
