               "Since the advent of computers, the natural and engineering sciences have enormously progressed. Computer simulations allow one to understand interactions of physical particles and make sense of astronomical observations, to describe many chemical properties ab initio, and to design energy-efficient aircrafts and safer cars. Today, the use of computational devices is pervasive. Offices, administrations, financial trading, economic exchange, the control of infrastructure networks, and a large share of our communication would not be conceivable without the use of computers anymore. Hence, it would be very surprising, if computers could not make a contribution to a better understanding of social and economic systems. While relevant also for the statistical analysis of data and data-driven efforts to reveal patterns of human interaction [1], we will focus here on the prospects of computer simulation of social and economic systems. More specifically, we will discuss the techniques of agent-based modeling (ABM) and multi-agent simulation (MAS), including the challenges, perspectives and limitations of the approach. In doing so, we will discuss a number of issues, which have not been covered by the excellent books and review papers available so far [2-10]. In particular, we will describe the different steps belonging to a thorough agent-based simulation study, and try to explain, how to do them right from a scientific perspective. To some extent, computer simulation can be seen as experimental technique for hypothesis testing and scenario analysis, which can be used complementary and in combination with experiments in real-life, the lab or the Web. It is well-known that the ways in which social scientists analyze human behavior, social interactions, and society vary largely. The methods range from qualitative to quantitative ones, and among the quantitative ones, some communities prefer detailed models with many variables and parameters, while others prefer simple or simplified models with a few variables and parameters only. Reference [11] discusses these different types of system description and their respective advantages and disadvantages. Overall, each method has its justification, and the choice of the proper method very much depends on the respective purpose. For example, the elaboration of applications such as new systems designs often requires a quite realistic and, hence, detailed description of all relevant aspects. In contrast, simple models may be used to get a better understanding of how social mechanisms work. They serve to reduce the complexity of a given system to an extent that allows to guide our thinking and provide an intuition how certain changes in the system would affect its dynamics and outcome. The application of computational models is currently not common in the social and economic sciences. This is perhaps because many people consider them as intransparent and unreliable (as compared to analytical methods) and/or as unsuitable for prediction. These points will be addressed later on. In fact, if properly done, computer simulations can deliver reliable results beyond the range of analytical tractability (see Sect. 2.3.6). Moreover, we will show in Sect. 2.4.1 that prediction is not generally impossible for socioeconomic systems and that it is even not necessary to improve a system (e.g. to reduce instabilities or vulnerabilities), see Sect. 2.4.2. Besides, the benefit of computational models is not restricted to prediction. Joshua Epstein, for example, discusses 16 other reasons to build models, including explanation, guiding data collection, revealing dynamical analogies, discovering new questions, illuminating core uncertainties, demonstrating tradeoffs, training practitioners, and last but not least decision support, particularly in crisis situations [12]. In fact, computer models can naturally complement classical research methods in the socioeconomic sciences. For example, they allow one to test whether mechanisms and theories used to explain certain observed phenomena are sufficient to understand the respective empirical evidence, or whether there are gaps or inconsistencies in the explanation. Moreover, they allow one to study situations, for which analytical solutions cannot be found anymore, and to go beyond the idealizations and approximations of simple models. Without the exploration of model behaviors that can only be numerically determined, scientific analysis is often restricted to unrealistic models and to situations, which may be of little relevance for reality. For example, the financial crisis may have been the result of approximations"

Such an approach would certainly be hard to transfer to the social sciences, as most system behaviors have not been formalized mathematically. A method that seems to be more suited for the computer simulation of socio-economic systems is agent-based modeling (ABM) . The corresponding computational technique is called multi-agent simulation (MAS) or agent-based computational modeling (\"ABC modeling\"). Depending on the problem of interest, agents may for example represent individuals, groups, companies, or countries and their interactions. The behaviors and interactions of the agents may be formalized by equations, but more generally they may be specified through (decision) rules, such as if-then kind of rules or logical operations. This makes the modeling approach much more flexible. Besides, it is easily possible to consider individual variations in the behavioral rules (\"heterogeneity\") and random influences or variations (\"stochasticity\").",

Therefore, they can shed new light on social and economic systems from an \"ecological\" perspective . In fact, evolutionary ecological models can also reflect the feature of steady innovation, which is typical for socio-economic systems.",

               "Agent-based computational modeling is also well suited for visualization. Here, it makes sense to distinguish agent-based models in science from computer games. While the latter may actually be based on agent-based models, they are often oriented at believability, i.e. at appearing as realistic as possible. However, computer games usually do not care too much about making realistic assumptions. That is, while the outcome may look realistic, the underlying mechanisms may not be well justified. As a consequence, they may not be suited to understand the outcome of the simulation, to draw conclusions, or to make predictions. Implications outside the exact settings that the game was prepared for are likely to be unreliable. Therefore, in many cases, such computer simulations will not produce useful knowledge beyond what has been put into the model. Scientific agent-based models, in contrast, do often not invest into believability. That is, they intentionally make simplifications and may, for example, represent people by circles, or purposefully restrict themselves to very few properties from the list given in Sect. 2.1.2. Instead of focusing on a plausible appearance, they try to represent a few characteristic features (such as certain kinds of interaction mechanisms) more realistically. Such computer simulations should enable one to draw conclusions about previously unexperienced scenarios, i.e. they should be in reasonable agreement with later empirical observations or experimental results. In other words, scientific simulations are more focused on getting the processes rather than the visual representation right. They are interested in explanatory power.",

It is usually no problem to apply methods from statistics and econometrics to simulation outcomes and to compare simulation results with actual data (after processing them in a way reflecting the measurement process). Moreover, by modeling the relationships on the level of individuals in a rule-based way, agentbased simulations allow one to produce characteristic features of the system as emergent phenomena without having to make a priori assumptions regarding the aggregate (\"macroscopic\") system properties."

For example, rather than assuming that individuals would strictly optimize over all options when decision are taken (as \"homo economicus\" would do), it seems justified to use simple decision heuristics, as evidence from social psychology suggests .

However, in many cases, spatial proximity is just one factor or even irrelevant. In many cases, one needs to consider friendship networks or other interaction networks. It is well-known that the statistical properties of the interaction network may matter for the dynamics of the system dynamics. As a consequence, it may also be needed to run the simulation for different interaction networks. For example, interactions in square grids and in hexagonal grids may sometimes lead to qualitatively different outcomes. Moreover, the number of interaction partners may be relevant for the system dynamics, as may be a heterogeneity in the number of interaction partners or the existence of loops in the interaction network.",

It is advised to test the sensitivity of the model with respect to the initial condition.",

For example, if a simulation of agents is performed in space, one needs to decide how the rules should look like at the boundary. One may decide to use a finite world such as a chess board. However, this may cause artificial behavior close to the boundaries of the simulation area. Therefore, in many cases one assumes \"periodic\" boundary conditions, which corresponds to a simulation on the surface of a torus. This is often simpler than the simulation on the surface of a sphere. Note, however, that an improper choice of the boundary conditions can sometimes produce artifacts, and that the simulated system size may affect the result. Therefore, one needs to have an eye on this and may have to test different specifications of the boundary conditions. ? Finally, it is necessary to specify the open model parameters, i.e. to calibrate the model. If the initial and boundary conditions, or the structure of the interaction network cannot be independently measured, they have to be treated as model parameters as well. In case there are enough empirical data, the parameters can be determined by minimizing an \"error function\", which measures the difference between simulation results and empirical data. Note that the choice of a suitable error function may be relevant, but non-trivial. An improperly chosen function may not be able to differentiate well between good and bad models. For example, minimizing the error between actual and simulated trajectories of pedestrians does not manage to distinguish well between a simple extrapolation model and a circular repulsion model for pedestrians, although the latter avoids collisions and is much more realistic . Or maximizing throughput may produce some unrealistic effects, such as the occurrence of pedestrians or drivers, who get trapped in a certain place , while a minimization of delay times ensures that everybody gets forward. Therefore, not only the model, but also the error function must be well chosen.",

Despite the simplicity of this method, it was surprisingly successful and managed to reproduce a number of striking self-organization phenomena observed in pedestrian crowds .",

Particularly, if the model contains many parameters, the reliability of the parameter estimates tends to be poor. In the worst case, this can imply dangerously misleading model predictions. To get an idea of the confidentiality intervals of parameters, one should therefore determine all parameter combinations which are compatible with the error bars of the empirical data to be reproduced."

The calibration dataset is used to determine the model parameters, and the validation dataset is used to measure the goodness of fit reached with the model parameters determined in the calibration stage. In order to make this calibration and validation procedure independent of the way in which the original dataset is subdivided, the whole procedure should be performed either for all possible subdivisions into calibration and validation datasets or for a representative statistical sample of all possibilities. As each of these subdivisions delivers a separate set of parameters in the calibration step, this results in a distribution of model parameters, which are consistent with the data. From these distributions, one can finally determine average or most likely model parameters as well as confidence intervals. Furthermore, the distribution of goodness-of-fit values reached in the related validation steps reflects the predictive power of the model. Another way of judging the power of a model is to determine the number of stylized facts that a model can reproduce. It sometimes makes sense to prefer a model that reproduces many different observations qualitatively well (for example, different observed kinds of traffic patterns) over a model whose goodness of fit is quantitatively better (for example, in terms of reproducing measured travel times). This applies in particular, if the model, which appears to be quantitatively superior, is not well consistent with the stylized facts . To distinguish models of different quality, it can also be useful to measure the goodness of fit with several different error functions."

               "The performance is often measured by the analysis of how the required computational time increases with the number N of agents in the system. In the ideal case, such a scalability analysis gives a linear (or constant) dependency on the \"system size\" N . In many cases, however, the computational time scales like a polynomial, or, what is even worse, like an exponential function. Hence, evaluating how a computer code scales with system size allows one to distinguish efficient implementations from inefficient ones. In computer science, the performance of algorithms is expressed by the \"complexity\" of an algorithm. For example, the term NP-hard refers to an algorithm which does not scale polynomially, which means that the computer time required for simulations explodes with the system size. In such cases, only moderate system sizes are numerically tractable on a PC. Larger systems may still be treated by parallelization of the computer code and parallel processing on dozens or hundreds of processors, but NP-hard problems can be too demanding even for the biggest supercomputers. However, it is sometimes possible to reduce the complexity considerably by applying reasonable approximations. For example, the simulation of pedestrian crowds can be significantly accelerated by assuming that pedestrians do not interact if their distance is greater than a certain value. Moreover, many optimization problems can be approximately solved by using suitable \"heuristics\" ."

               "An important way of studying the behavior of socio-economic systems with agentbased models is the scanning of the parameter space. As was pointed out in Sect. 2.1.5, systems composed of many non-linearly interacting agents are likely to produce a number of self-organized or emergent phenomena. It is, therefore, interesting to determine the conditions under which they occur. In particular, it is relevant to identify the separating lines (or hypersurfaces) in the parameter space that separate different system behaviors (\"system states\") from each other, and to determine the character of the related \"phase transitions\": One typically checks whether it is a continuous (\"second-order\") transition, at which systemic properties start to change smoothly, or a discontinuous (\"first-order\") transition, where a sudden regime shift occurs (see . The latter transitions occur, for example, in cases of hysteresis (\"history dependence\"), and their possible types have been studied by \"catastrophe theory\" (see . Scientific paradigm shifts, for example, are typically first-order transitions , as are revolutions in societies . The parameter dependencies of the different kinds of system states (\"phases\") and their separating lines or hypersurfaces are usually represented by \"phase diagrams\". A particularly interesting case occurs, if the system displays multistability, i.e. were different stable states are possible, depending on the respective initial condition or history. For example, in traffic theory, various kinds of congested traffic states may result, depending on the size of perturbations in the traffic flow (see . That circumstance allows one to understand systems, which show apparently inconsistent behaviors. In fact, it is quite common for social systems that a certain characteristic system behavior is reported in one part of the world, while another one is observed elsewhere . There may nevertheless be a common theory explaining both system behaviors, and history-dependence may be the reason for the different observations. Scanning parameter spaces typically requires large computational resources. Even when using a computer pool, it may require weeks to determine a twodimensional phase diagram at reasonable accuracy. Varying more parameters will consume even more time. However, one way of determining interesting areas of the parameter space is to use the \"overlay method\", which simulates interactions in two-dimensional space, but additionally varies the parameter values in horizontal Overlay phase diagram for an evolutionary public goods game with success-driven migration as well as prosocial and antisocial punishment, representing different behaviors by different colors (recent work with Wenjian Yu; see Chap. 8 for an explanation of the different behaviors such as 'moralists' and 'immoralists'). The prevalent behavior depends on the size of the model parameters (here: the punishment cost and fine), which is varied along the axes. One can see that people showing the same behavior tend to form clusters (a phenomenon called \"homophily\"). Moreover, cooperators (mainly green moralists and a few blue non-punishing cooperators) spread above a hyperbolic kind of line. Below it, defectors (red or black) florish. The spreading of moralists above a certain punishment level gets rid of the conventional free-rider and the secondorder free-rider problem. Mobility speeds up the convergence to the finally resulting strategy distribution. It also increases the green area of moralists, i.e. it pushes the hyperbolic separation line to lower punishment values. Defectors who punish non-punishers (grey) occur around the separating line. Defectors who punish defectors (yellow immoralists) occur in separation from each other (as loners). They require enough space, which they mainly find at low densities, or when mobility creates areas of low density. In the mixed phase of black and red, and in the mixed phase of blue and green, there is only a slow logarithmic coarsening, because the payoffs are the same. (This looks like a coexistence of two strategies, if the simulations are not run long enough.) The occurence of black defectors who punish cooperators can explain the existence of antisocial punishers. Black antisocial punishers can exist basically at all punishment levels, if they can cluster together and are not in direct neighborhood to moralists and vertical direction. In this way, one may get a quick impression of the spatiotemporal dynamics in different areas of the considered two-dimensional parameter space (see . After identifying the approximate location of separating lines between different phases (i.e. qualitatively different system behaviors), a finegrained analysis (e.g. scaling analysis) can be made to reveal the detailed behavior next to the phase separation lines (or hysersurfaces)."

However, when a transition line (or hypersurface) is crossed, significant changes in the system behavior are expected, particularly if the transition is of first order (i.e. discontinuous).",

               "However, a multi-agent simulation may not only be sensitive to parameter changes. It may also be sensitive to minor modifications of the agent-based model itself. For example, slight changes of the interaction network (by adding or subtracting nodes or links) may impact the system behavior. Analyses of failure and attack tolerance demonstrate this very well . To investigate so-called k-failures, one randomly removes k agents or links from the system and studies changes in the system performance. Similarly, one may investigate the impact of adding k links or agents. The method is capable to reveal certain kinds of \"structural instabilities\". A further kind of structural instabilities may be caused by modifications in the rules determining the interactions of agents. Such modifications may reflect innovations, but also inaccuracies of the model as compared to reality. For example, \"unknown unknowns\" are factors overlooked in the model, but they may be discovered to a certain extent by varying the model assumptions.

               "1. As pointed out before, there are many other purposes of modeling and simulation besides prediction . For example, models may be used to get a picture of the robustness of a system to perturbations (i.e. applied to perform simulated \"stress tests\", considering the effect of interactions among the entities constituting the system). 2. \"Model predictions\" should be better understood as \"model implications\" rather than \"model forecasts\", e.g. a statements that say what systemic outcomes (e.g. cooperation, free-riding, or conflict) are expected to occur for certain (regulatory) boundary conditions (see Sect. 2.4.2.2). 3. It is important to recognize that forecasts are possible sometimes. A famous example is Moore's law regarding the performance of computer chips (which is ultimately a matter of the innovation rate ). Moreover, while the detailed ups and downs of stock markets are hard to predict, the manipulation of interest rates by central banks leads, to a certain extent, to foreseeable effects. Also the sequence in which the real-estate market in the US affected the banking system, the US economy, and the world economy was quite logical. That is, even though the exact timing can often not be predicted, causality networks allow one to determine likely courses of events (see .5). In principle, this enables us to take counter-actions in order to avoid or mitigate the further spreading of the crisis . 4. As weather forecasts show, even unreliable short-term forecasts can be useful and of great economic value (e.g. for agriculture). Another example illustrating this is a novel self-control principle for urban traffic flows, which was recently invented . Although its anticipation of arriving platoons is of very short-term nature, it manages to reduce travel times, fuel consumption, and vehicle emissions.",
               "In conclusion, prediction is limited in socio-economic systems, but more powerful than many people believe. Moreover, in certain contexts, it is not necessary to forecast the course of events. For example, in order to reduce problems resulting from bubbles in financial markets, it is not necessary to predict the time of their bursting or even to know about their concrete existence. The reason for this will be explained in Sect. 2.4.2.3. Furthermore, Sec.2.4.2.2 shows how the often raised problem of self-destroying prophecies can be avoided. ). Note that the largest damage of most disasters is caused by cascading effects, i.e. the systemic impact of an over-critical local perturbation"

               "When trying to improve socio-economic systems, first of all, it must be stressed that the idea to control socio-economic systems is not only inadequate -it is also not working well. As socio-economic systems are complex systems, cause and effect are usually not proportional to each other. In many cases, complex systems tend to resist manipulation attempts (cf. \"Goodhart's law\"), while close to so-called \"tipping points\" (or \"critical points\"), unexpected \"regime shifts\" (\"phase transitions\", \"catastrophes\") may happen. Consequently, complex systems cannot be controlled like a technical system (such as a car) . The above property of systemic resistance is actually a result of the fact that complex systems often self-organize, and that their behavior is robust to nottoo-large perturbations. While forcing complex systems tends to be expensive (if systemic resistance is strong) or dangerous (if an unexpected systemic shift is caused), the alternative to support the self-organization of the system appears to be promising. Such an approach \"goes with the flow\" (using the natural tendencies in the system) and is resource-efficient. Therefore, a reasonable way to manage complexity is to guide self-organization or facilitating coordination .",
               "In a certain sense, this self-organization or self-control approach moves away from classical regulation to mechanism design . Regulation often corresponds to changing the boundary conditions, while mechanism design changes the interactions in the system in a way that reduces instabilities (e.g. due to delays) and avoids that the system is trapped in local optima (and continues its evolution to a systemoptimal state). For example, slightly modifying the interaction of cars by special driver assistant systems can stabilize traffic flows and avoid bottleneck effects to a certain degree ."

               "It is often pointed out that socio-economic systems would not be predictable, because the reaction of people to information about the system would destroy the validity of the forecast. If done in the wrong way, this is actually true. Let us illustrate this by an example: Assume that all car drivers are given the same information about existing traffic jams. Then, drivers may most likely over-react, i.e. more drivers may use an alternative road than is required to reach a systemoptimal distribution of traffic flows . However, as has been shown by laboratory route choice experiments, an almost optimal route choice behavior may be reached by an information system that gives user-specific recommendations. In other words, some drivers would be asked to stay on the congested road, and others to leave it. When the recommendation system compensates for the fact that not everyone follows the recommendations, one can avoid over-or under-reactions of drivers in congestion scenarios .",
               "One crucial issue of such individualized recommender systems, however, is their reliability. An unreliable system or one that is systematically biased, will be only poorly followed, and people will eventually compensate for biases . Therefore, it is also essential to design the information system in a way that is fair to everyone. That is, nobody should have a systematic advantage. Nevertheless, the system should be flexible enough to allow a trading of temporary (dis)advantages. For example, somebody who was asked to take the slower road on a given day (and who would have a right to use the faster road on another day), may still use the faster road. However, he or she would have to pay a fee for this, which would be earned by somebody else, who would exchange his or her \"ticket\" for the faster road for a \"ticket\" for the slower road. In such a way, the system optimum state could still be maintained .",
               "In summary, the above described information system would cheat nobody, and it would be flexible and fair. Only people who use the faster road more often than average would have to pay a road usage fee. A normal driver would either pay nothing on average: While he or she will pay on some days (when being under a pressure of time, while the recommendation asks to take the slower road), the same amount of money can be earned on other days by taking the slower road. In other words, fair usage would be free of charge on average, and drivers would still have a freedom of route choice. The primary goal of the system would not be to suppress traffic flows through road pricing, but the pricing scheme would serve to reach a system optimal traffic state."

If the interactions in the system are weak, the system dynamics can be well influenced by modifying the boundary conditions of the system (i.e. by regulatory measures). However, if the interactions are strong, as in many social and economic processes, the self-organization of the system dominates the external influence. In this case, a modification of interactions in the system (\"mechanism design\") seems to be more promising. (A good example for this is a traffic assistance system that reduces the likelihood of congestion by special driver assistance systems .) Of course, regulatory measures and mechanism design may also be combined with each other.",
               "While mechanism design is relatively common in computer science and some other areas (e.g. in evolutionary game theory, mathematics, and partly in physics), it seems that these methods have not been extensively applied in the social sciences so far. For example, there are many different mechanisms to match supply and demand, and it would be interesting to know what systemic properties they imply (such as the level of stability, the efficiency of markets, the resulting wealth distribution, the creation of investment opportunities, etc.). It is also not clear how to reach the best combination of top-down and bottom-up elements in decision-making processes, and how to find the best balance between centralized and decentralized coordination approaches. All this poses interesting and practically relevant challenges that determine the prosperity and well-being of societies (see also ).",
               "Moreover, in the past, mechanism design has been applied basically to subsystems, i.e. parts of the complex overall system we are living in. However, due to the interconnection of all sorts of (sub-)systems (e.g. of the traffic, supply, industrial, environmental, health and social systems), measures in one (sub)system may have undesired side effects on other (sub)systems. In fact, for fundamental reasons, it is quite frequent that taking the best action in one (sub)system affects another (sub)system in a negative way. Such partial improvements will usually not promote an optimal state of society (whatever the optimal state of society may be). A good example for this is the poor performance of traffic light controls that optimize locally (without a coordination with neighboring intersections) . Unfortunately, such kinds of problems are not at all restricted to traffic systems. Undesirable feedback effects (like spill-over effects and mutual obstructions) are quite common for many networked systems, such as logistic or production systems, or even administrative processes ."

Besides, there is a danger of misusing models to promote individual interests that are not compatible with human well-being. However, the following goals appear to be widely acceptable:",

Most optimization methods used today eliminate heterogeneity in the system, i.e. there is one optimal solution which is applied to everyone. For socio-economic systems, this appears to be particularly problematic, as it tends to reduce socio-diversity and innovation. Besides, it is promoting average performance rather than individual strengths. A way to overcome this problem is suggested in the following.",
               "The crucial question in this connection is, how to translate the performance values X ij of the alternative systems i (measured on multiple scales j by goal functions g j ) into one scale. Traditionally, this is done by weighting each criterion j or goal function with a certain factor w j . This results in the overall individual performance",

Putting this into the context of the European Union for illustration, each country could choose a systemic design which fits the respective national strengths best. Hence, the \"pluralistic\" goal function (2.2) overcomes a number of problems of the optimization methods that are predominantly used today (namely, one-dimensional ranking scales, which measure the performance in an individually non-differentiated way, which typically creates one winner and many losers)."

It will also help to avoid destabilizing delays and to increase the efficiency of crisis response measures.

Multi-agent simulations will integrate measurement-based data-mining and model-based simulation approaches. This approach goes beyond feeding in real-time inputs (such as initial and boundary conditions, parameters, and network characteristics) into multi-agent simulations: it performs a data-driven pattern recognition and modeling in parallel to related computer simulations and, thereby, combines the strengths of both methods to reach the optimum accuracy and predictability. For example, integrating two incomplete sets of traffic information (cross-sectional measurements and floating car data) and a fluid-dynamic real-time traffic simulation facilitates to reduce the delay times between the formation and detection of traffic jams by 50%, and to double the reliability of such traffic information. ?
