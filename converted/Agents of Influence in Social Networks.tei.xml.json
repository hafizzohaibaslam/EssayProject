               "Categories and Subject Descriptors In recent years, social networking sites and social media have become a very important part of peoples' lives, driving everything from family relationships to revolutions. In this work, we study the different patterns of interaction behavior seen in an online social network. We investigate the difference in the relative time people allocate to their friends versus that which their friends allocate to them, and propose a measure for this difference in time allocation. The distribution of this measure is used to identify classes of social agents through agglomerative hierarchical clustering. These classes are then characterized in terms of two important structural attributes: Degree distributions and clustering coefficients. We demonstrate our approach on two large social networks obtained from Facebook. For each network we have the list of all social interactions that took place over six months. The total number of users in the two networks is 939,453 and 841,456, with 1.4 million and 8.4 million interactions, respectively. Our results show that, based the interaction behavior, there are four main classes of agents in both networks , and that they are consistent across the two networks. Furthermore, each class is characterized by a specific profile of degree distributions and clustering coefficients, which are also consistent across both networks. We speculate that agents corresponding to the four classes play different roles in the social network. To test this, we developed an opinion propagation model where opinions are represented as m-bit strings communicated from agent to agents. An agent receiving an opinion then selectively modifies its own opinions depending on the social and informa-tional value it places upon communications from the sending agent, its overall agreement with the sending agent, and its own propensties. Opinions are injected into the system by agents of specific classes and their spread is tracked by propagating tags. The resulting data is used to analyze the influence of agents from each class in the viral spread of ideas under various conditions. The analysis also shows what be-havioral factors at the agent level have the most significant impact on the spreading of ideas."

               "The advent of social networks is a major revolution in the history of the Internet age. Today, being 'online' is the default mode for millions of people worldwide. Many sectors of society such as business, politics, advertising, gaming, etc., have embraced social networks and have sought to exploit their potential to reach the masses. Indeed, social media has allowed even individuals to set up channels of communication that rival the commercial media in their influence. The average user on Facebook has 130 friends, and people spend over 700 billion minutes per month on the site . The growth of users on Google+ has occured even faster. LinkedIn's membership rocketed from 28 million users to more than 35 million users in the six months following the September 2008 onset of economic collapse .",
               "The key factor that sustains such social networking sites and the businesses based on them is the propagation of information. Every user in the network is a potential point of idea injection for mass propagation. However, it is clear that not all users can achieve the same level of influence. This depends on many factors such as the users' behavior, the semantic content of the information being propagated, the structural properties of the network, etc. In this paper, we use several large datasets to develop a behavior-based classification of agents in a social network , and to evaluate what type of agents are likely to be influential in different situations. There is already a large -and growing -body of research devoted to understanding the structure and evolution of online social communities. Some of these studies have classified members of social networks into one of three classesbased on their structural role in the network: Singletons are agents with zero friends; the giant component comprises users who are connected directly or indirectly to a large fraction of the entire network; and the the middle region covers small groups whose agents only interact mainly with others within the group and not with the network at large. In this study we aim to classify users into groups based on their interactional behavior rather than structural position. We believe that such classification will reveal valuable insights on the way users divide their social time between their friends on the network."

               "The issue of how ideas spread virally in a social network has been of great interest recently. This work has considered a variety of factors that determine the importance of individual agents in a network. These range from structural properties to the nature of the users and their interactions with each other. Trusov et al. proposed a method for finding influential users in a network community using the number of their logins in a particular time frame as the metric for being \"influential\". Though intuitively appealing, this approach did not provide any unexpected insights. Similarly, Crandall et al. proposed a method to show that social influence and similarity go hand-in-hand such that users tend to form new links based on similarity, which grows their sphere of social influence and, in turn, creates more similarity with users to whom they create new links.",
               "Simpkins et al. considered the role of psychological and cognitive factors in shaping the profile of idea propagation. They postulated that an idea has a 'cognitive advantage' in being retained or accepted in a particular community which is culturally circumscribed around that idea.",
               "Kempe et al. studied the problem of maximizing information spread in a social community network using recommendation or influential propagation in the form of a decreasing cascade model. In this model, a behavior spreads in a cascading fashion according to a probabilistic rule, beginning with a set of initially \"active\" or \"influential\" nodes. In another paper , they propose an intuitive greedy algorithm to show that it is a more efficient way to find which set of individuals should be targeted in a network for maximizing the spread of influence. This work is closest to ours in terms of its objectives.",
               "In , Kleinberg showed that it is easier to find short chains between points in some networks than others. He proved that networks that include individuals operating with purely local information are very adept at finding these short chains. Considering the dynamics of a network, Ghosh et al. have proposed that predicting influential users depends not only on the structure of the network, but also on details of the dynamic processes occurring on it. They classify processes as conservative and non-conservative, and claim that information spread is non-conservative. They empirically define influence as the number of in-network votes a user's post generates. This influence measure, and the resulting ranking, is evaluated from the dynamics of voting on the social news aggregator Digg, which represents nonconservative information flow. They compare their predictions of different influence models with this empirical estimate of influence. The results show that non-conservative models are better able to predict influential users on Digg and the best predictor metric is found to be the normalized-centrality. : Statisctics of the Facebook Dataset used in this paper study, we use several anonymized datasets of FaceBook interactions among large groups of agents over extended periods to identify classes of agents based on interaction behavior. In particular, we consider the relative social attention agents devote to interacting with other agents, and identify four distinct types of behavior in this regard. These four classes are found to be robust across multiple datasets in terms of both interaction patterns and structural properties, indicating that they capture real differences betwee agents. We then train a neural network classifier to recognize these classes, and show that it can successfully classify agents in a novel dataset according to their interaction patterns. We also provde provisional interpretations of the four behavior patterns identified in this study."

Two kcliques are considered to be adjacent if they share k-1 nodes. We decided to use k = 5 because a value of k > 5 produces very few communities, and a value of k = 4 produces too many small ones.

At the end of the simulation, any agent with one or two tagged bits is considered influenced. The percentage of agents influenced over a 150 step simulation is returned as the metric of influence.

First, it should be remembered that the efficacy of injecting opinions in one type of the agent or another depends on several things: 1) The inherent reach of the agent, i.e., how far can the agent itself disseminate opinions through direct connections; 2) The types of agents that it connects to, and their reach patterns; and 3) The chains of devotion linking agents along the tree of connections rooted at the injected agent.

Interestingly, the advantage of Type 2 agents is affected most strongly by the strength of the similarity factor (f1) in the process. We speculate that this reflects the fact that most friends for Type 2 agents have devotion values near zero towards them, while friends of Type 3 and 4 agents have mostly positive values (as implied by the mostly negative devotion values of Type 3 and 4 agents themselves). Thus, Type 2 agents rely mainly on their reach and the inherent influenceability of their friends rather than devotion to convince others. When these factors are reduced, Type 2 agents lose almost all of their extra influence, while Type 3 and 4 agents can still rely on devition (factor f2) to compensate somewhat.",
               "? Type 3 and Type 4 agents have almost the same level of influence in all situations. Both classes have high degree and low clustering coefficients, so they can spread quite broadly. Additionally, their own mainly negative ? values indicate their most of their friends have positive relative devotion towards them, so when w2 > 0, their influence is boosted by this.",

Given the model used, the mean initial similarity among any two agents is about 0.11, giving an influence factor f1 = 0.0584. Thus when the weights are set as (1, 0, 0) (first table, column 1), any mismatched bit in a receiving agent has only a 5% chance of being influenced. It is also clear that, in this situation, the class of the injected agent has virtually no effect.",
               "A full analysis of the effects of influencing factors and agent types requires a much more detailed investigation, both through more simulation cases and through analysis of network connectivity patterns. Results from such investigations will be reported in the future.",
               "? Influence spreads most when the third factor -f3, inherent receptiveness -dominates. This is because f3 is set to a high value (0.5) for all agents, so a receiving agent has a 50-50 chance of changing a mismatched bit. In this case, the class of the injected agent does matter -probably due to differences in connectivity and clustering."
