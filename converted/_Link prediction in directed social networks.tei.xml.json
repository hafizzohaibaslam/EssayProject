               "In today's online social networks, it becomes essential to help newcomers as well as existing community members to find new social contacts. In scientific literature, this recommendation task is known as link prediction. Link prediction has important practical applications in social network platforms. It allows social network platform providers to recommend friends to their users. Another application is to infer missing links in partially observed networks. The shortcoming of many of the existing link prediction methods is that they mostly focus on undirected graphs only. This work closes this gap and introduces link prediction methods and metrics for directed graphs. Here, we compare well-known similarity metrics and their suit-ability for link prediction in directed social networks. We advance existing techniques and propose mining of sub-graph patterns that are used to predict links in networks such as GitHub, GooglePlus, and Twitter. Our results show that the proposed metrics and techniques yield more accurate predictions when compared with metrics not accounting for the directed nature of the underlying networks."

               "Social networks have become ubiquitous in our everyday activities. People use social networks to communicate, collaborate, and share information. One of the most profound properties of social networks is their dynamic nature. People join and leave social networks. Also, the circle of friends may frequently change when people establish friendship through social links or when their interest in a social relationship ends and the link is removed. Due to the large number of users being part of today's online communities, it becomes increasingly cumbersome to find new contacts and friends. Many social network platform providers assist their users in establishing new social relations by making recommendations. The meaning of a recommendation varies depending on the concrete social network platform. In platforms such as , a link between two people is established if both persons agree to have a friendship relation. The resulting network is thus undirected because both persons share mutual friendship. Another example of a social network is . In Twitter, a link between two persons is established if a user is interested in news updates of another user. The link is thus directed because there is no mutual agreement needed to establish a link. The resulting network is directed and is also called follower network. User can follow an arbitrary number of other users to receive news or activity updates. The 'follow' feature is in widespread use in social networking services such as , , or . In Facebook, the users can follow (or unfollow) news updates of their friends. The social (undirected) link between friends is maintained irrespective of the follow relationship. Recently, collaborative online platforms such as also offer social network features (e.g., following). GitHub is an online 'coding' community. Users contribute code and share repositories with the community. The 'follow' feature in GitHub allows users to keep track of updates regarding various software development activities such as coding or bug-fixing.",
               "All of the before mentioned platforms have a large number of users and benefit from 'follow' recommendations. Such recommendations can be formulated as a link prediction task. Link prediction in a directed follower network has the purpose of giving recommendations which a given user should follow. Despite some existing literature in the area of link prediction on Twitter (for example, see , or prediction of positive/negative edges ( ), there is relatively little work on link prediction in directed social networks. As reported in a recent survey (Lu and Zhou 2011), the existing studies on link prediction overwhelmingly focus on undirected networks. This work specifically addresses the link prediction problem in directed social networks.",
               "The essential approach we follow in this work is to measure the similarity between a pair of nodes using structural information. We assume that a social network is modeled as a directed graph G(V, E), where vertices V in the graph depict people and edges E between vertices relations between people. Structural information is, for example, the number of common neighbors between two nodes. Generally speaking, similarity of nodes can be measured as the number of common features. The goal of link prediction is to predict whether a link between two users will be established or if a link in a partially observed network is missing. The latter case is a common problem when the social network is obtained through a crawling procedure.",

Local information is typically obtained by comparing degree of overlap of two individual friendship networks. ) systematically compared a number of local similarity indices in many real networks. These metrics focus on undirected graphs without considering directed relations. The advantage of local indices is that they can be computed for large-scale networks and do not require a huge amount of computational resources.",
               "Global Similarity Indices Global metrics take the properties of the whole social network into account. The Katz index ) is based on the ensemble of all paths between two nodes in the network. The index is computed as the sum over the collection of all paths and is exponentially damped by length to give the shorter paths more weight. Another class of metrics are random walk techniques. Well-known algorithms such as PageRank ( ) can be used to compute global importance metrics. The prediction is then based on the node's PageRank importance score. PageRank can be personalized to perform ranking with respect to a certain 'contexts' or topics . A direct application of personalized PageRank are supervised random walks (SRW). In (Backstrom and Leskovec 2011), SRW were proposed to recommend links in networks such as is based on the idea that two nodes are similar if they are related to similar nodes. Global similarity indices naturally require information regarding the whole topology of the social network. Indeed, this information may not be available due to, for example, partially observed networks or in cases where the platform is decentralized. Another important aspect is performance and resource consumption. The calculation of global indices may be very time consuming and for large-scale networks the computation may not be feasible.",
               "Semi-local indices Instead of taking the whole topology into account, semi-local indices omit information that makes little contribution to improve the prediction algorithm's accuracy. The Local Path Index ( ) for example, provides a trade-off between computational complexity and accuracy. Local Random Walks (Backstrom and Leskovec 2011; Liu and Lu 2010) follow a similar idea by omitting information from very distant neighbors in the network.",
               "Further methods for link prediction include hierarchical models , stochastic block models ( ), probabilistic models (Lu and Zhou 2011), and methods considering positive/negative links (Symeonidis and Mantas 2013) (see (Lu and Zhou 2011) for details on models and methods).",
               "Patterns, triads and motifs The approach as proposed in this work takes the directed nature of follower networks into account. Triadic closure in social networks is the hypothesis that the formation of an edge between u and v is strongly dependent upon the degree of overlap of u's and v's individual friendship networks (for example, see Snijders 2012; . However, an important theory in this context is the 'strength of weak ties' (Granovetter 1973) stressing the cohesive power of seemingly less important ties. ) developed many important theories about social relations and how to detect structure in directed networks. As a more general conceptual framework, network motifs (Alon 2007; represent elementary building blocks in complex networks. Complex networks include social, technological, or biological networks. We build upon these ideas and propose link prediction considering triad patterns in social networks.",

The network was also obtained from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection (2013) and is also managed within the Flat File Here, we discuss the link prediction configuration settings that were used to perform experiments. Experiments have been performed using the three previously introduced datasets: GitHub (GH), GooglePlus (GP), and Twitter (TW). lists the prediction user set size |U P |, the validation set size |E V | and the root set size |U R |. For GitHub, the prediction user set U P consists of 10 % of the users which are connected through 148,796 edges. From those edges, we sampled 29,759 random edges (20 %) and added them to E V . The root set U R is populated with 100 nodes. The size of the prediction target set U T can be easily calculated as U T = U P -U R . In GooglePlus, we use the entire user base for U P , which also results in approximately the same size of U P as for GitHub's prediction user set. E V consists of 2,709,731 edges (20 %) and the root set U R consists also of 100 nodes. The Twitterbased dataset has the smallest number of nodes and, in the same manner as for GooglePlus, we also select all nodes for U P . E V has 333,577 edges (again 20 %) and the same root set size as for GitHub and GooglePlus is applied.",

The relative frequency of each triad pattern in G P is listed in . The total number of triad patters in each network is 423,034,532 (GitHub), , and 296,075,286 (Twitter). The patterns at the top in are open triads T01-T09 followed by closed triads T11-T36. The patterns are sorted in descending order by the column GH. The most common triad pattern in GitHub with 53.23 % is where both u and v are followed by z but neither u nor v follow z. This pattern has a relative frequency of 7.04 % in Twitter, thereby being the second most common pattern in Twitter, and a relative frequency of 9.97 % in GooglePlus, thereby being the fourth most common pattern in GooglePlus. The second most common pattern in GitHub, and the most common pattern in GooglePlus and Twitter, is the pattern where both u and v follow z but z follows neither of them. Triadic Closeness is defined as the likelihood that a given open triad (T01-T09) will be closed in a given social network. Thus, the triad patterns T01-T09 are seen in relation with the closed triads to determine the closeness between two nodes.",

As a general note, an AUC value above 0.5 indicates that a prediction algorithm performs better than pure chance. Higher AUC indicates better prediction accuracy. With regards to ROC curves, we group metrics into a single class if their AUC values are identical.   GitHub As a first step, we present the prediction results of GitHub-based experiments. The ROC curves are depicted by . The metrics and class correspondence is established in . We provide the AUC values along with the curves in and also in for easier readability. In GitHub, TC corresponds to C1 and an AUC value of 0.98. Thus, TC outperforms the other methods and delivers the highest accuracy. RA delivers also very good results with an AUC of 0.97.

               "The prediction of missing links and the prediction of future links is an important task in the domain of social network analysis. The former helps to infer the 'real' social network structure, while the latter is used to give friendship as well as following recommendations to users. A wide range of local, global, and semi-local metrics have been proposed by previous work. A large body of existing literature, however, focuses on undirected networks only. This work closes this gap by focusing on directed networks. Here, we propose triad patterns to predict links between nodes in directed graphs. Our approach is called Triadic Closeness. We designed and implemented a link prediction framework that is able to perform predictions in large-scale social networks. The framework's architecture has been presented and discussed in detail. We performed experiments in three different social networks. First, we analyzed the effectiveness of our proposed approach in GitHub; a social coding community. Second, we obtained a subset of the GooglePlus network and third we performed experiments in a subset of the Twitter follower network. The pattern-based prediction approach delivers the best results among the compared local methods. TC consistently outperformed other approaches. Thus, a pattern-based approach is better suited in directed social networks. At this stage, we have not considered weighted edges in prediction methods. Edge weights may be obtained through interaction analysis in social network. Weighted networks are subject to our future research. An important aspect will also be the extension of our approach towards global and semi-local methods. As an example, the personalized PageRank method could provide the basis for patternaware link prediction. We are currently working on the design of this method."
