               "Keywords Usually a customer make the decision to buy a product if she/he is cumulatively impacted by enough pieces of information for the product. In this paper we use the classical independent cascade model in social network to model the information diffusion. In this model, the active probability of a node can be regarded as the frequency of a customer receiving information after multiple information diffusion. In this work we study a new type of activation named cumulative activation. A node is cumulatively active if its active probability is beyond a given threshold. Two optimization problems are investigated under this framework: seed minimization with cumulative activation (SM-CA) problem, which asks how to select a seed set with minimum size such that the number of cumulatively active nodes can reach a given threshold; influence maximization with cumulative activation (IM-CA) problem, which asks how to choose a seed set with a fixed budget to maximize the number of cumulatively active nodes. We first show the nonsubmodularity of the function representing the number of cumulatively active nodes, which means unlike many previously studied problems in social network, our problems cannot be solved directly via submodular function optimization. For SM-CA problem, we design a greedy algorithm which yields a bi-criteria O(ln n)-approximation when �� = n, here �� is the given threshold and n is the number of nodes in the network. For �� < n, we show an ?(n ��)-inapproximate result under a wildly believed hardness assumption of the densest k-subgraph problem. For IM-CA problem, we prove that it is NP-hard to approximate the problem within n 1?�� for any �� > 0. What's more, we provide two efficient heuristic algorithms for SM-CA and IM-CA respectively. Experiments results on different real-world social networks show that our heuristic algorithms outperform many previous algorithms. social networks; independent cascade model; cumulative activation ; influence maximization; seed minimization"

In recent years, with the rapid increasing popularity of Facebook, Google and Twitter etc., social networks have become powerful media for spreading information, ideas and products among individuals. Specially, marketing for products through social networks can attract large amount of customers.",
               "Motivated by this background, influence in social networks has been extensively studied. However, most of previous works only consider the influence after one time spreading. In contrast, in the real world, people typically make decisions after they have cumulated many pieces of information concerning an item, whether it is a new technology, new product, etc. Consider the following scenario: A company is going to launch a new version (named as V7 for convenient) of their product, but most people are not familiar with the performance of this new product. Thus, it is better for the company to show multiple versions of advertisements for different features of V7. To marketing in a social network, one frequently used and highly effective way is to choose a few influential people in the network and pay them such that they can broadcast advertisements of V7. We call those influential people \"seeds\".",
               "Standing on the perspective of potential customers, the first time they receive the information of V7 from their friends, they may forward this information, but this may not necessarily lead to their purchase action. Users may repeatedly receive and forward new information about V7, until they have cumulated enough pieces of information about the new product, at which time the purchase action is triggered. We model this by assuming that there is a threshold for each customer, who will buy V7 if the amount of information and recommendation that he receives exceeding his threshold. We measure the amount of information a user received as the fraction of information cascades that reaches the user, which is simply the activation probability of the user in an information cascade model. Therefore, we have an information cascade model to specify how information or influence propagates in the social network, and the model determines the probability of user receiving information (given a fixed seed set), which is interpreted as the fraction of information received by the user, and the user is finally activated if the fraction of information it receives exceeds his own threshold.",
               "Our diffusion process following the widely used independent cascade model presented in : A social network is defined on a directed graph with nodes representing individuals and edges representing relationships between individuals. Each edge is related to an activation probability. Initially, a set of nodes is selected as seeds and become active, all other nodes are inactive. At each step, active nodes have one chance to activate each of its inactive out-neighbor and if successful (with probability on edges) then the neighbor become active. In this diffusion model, each node has a probability to be active. We say a node is cumulatively active if this probability exceeds its threshold. This probability can be regarded as the amount of recommendation the node receives after a large number of diffusion processes.",
               "Given the above cumulative activation model, the company may be facing one of the following two objectives: either the company may have a fixed budget to activate the seed nodes, and want to maximize the number of cumulative activations, or the company may need to reach a predetermined number of cumulative activations, and want to minimize the number of seeds.",
               "We formulate the above scenarios as the following two optimization problems: Seed minimization with cumulative activation (SM-CA) problem and influence maximization with cumulative activation (IM-CA) problem. Given a directed graph with a probability on each edge and a threshold for each node, a requirementand a budget k, the SM-CA problem is to find a seed set with minimum size such that the number of cumulatively active nodes is at least. The IM-CA problem is to find a seed set with k nodes such that the number of cumulatively active nodes is maximum.",
               "In this paper, we first show the nonsubmodularity of the function corresponding to the number of cumulatively active nodes under a seed set for SM-CA problem and IM-CA problem, which means we can not use greedy algorithm directly to guarantee the approximation ratio.",
               "For SM-CA problem, we consider the case= n and< n separately, where n is the number of nodes in the network. The complexity results on these two cases are quite different. When= n, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate within (1 ?) ln n for any> 0. Then we construct a contribution function f (S) which can guarantee the equivalency to all feasible solutions of SM-CA problem. We prove that exactly computing f (S) is #P-hard but f (S) can be estimated with enough precision by Monte Carlo simulation. We also show the submodularity of f (S) and then design a greedy algorithm yielding a bicriteria O(ln n)-approximation.",
               "When< n, we construct a reduction from the dense k-subgraph problem to SM-CA problem and show that SM-CA problem can not be approximated within Finally, we conduct experiments on two real-world social networks to test the performance of our heuristic algorithms.",
               "To summarize, our contributions include: (a) we propose the seed minimization and influence maximization problem under cumulative activation (SM-CA problem and IM-CA problem respectively), which is a reasonable model for purchasing behavior of customers; (b)we design a greedy algorithm for SM-CA problem when= n with tight performance ratio; (c) we show strong hardness results for SM-CA problem when< n and IM-CA problem; (d) we design two heuristic algorithms for SM-CA problem and two heuristic algorithms for IM-CA problem and empirically demonstrate the performance ratio for our heuristic algorithms using realworld datasets."

Each edge e = (u, v)E is associated with a probability puv, which represents the probability that u activates v. Our influence process follows the independent cascade (IC) model proposed by . In the IC model, discrete time steps t = 0, 1, 2,are used to model the diffusion process. Each node in G has two states: inactive or active, all nodes are inactive at step 0. At step 1, a subset S ? V is selected as seed set and nodes in the seed set are activated directly. For any step t1, if a node u is newly activated at step t ? 1, then u has a single chance to activate each of its inactive out-neighbor v with independent probability puv. Once a node becomes active, it will never return to the inactive state. The diffusion process stops when there is no new activation at a time step.",

Suppose that each node has an accepted thresholdu and a node is called cumulatively active if Pu(S)u. We call this type of activation as Cumulative Activation (CA). Given a target set U ?

In total, there will be n c + n + k nodes become cumulatively active. On the other hand, let's consider the case if there is no set cover of size k. Again we can assume all the seeds are selected from set nodes, since as a candidate for seeds, set nodes are more efficient than element nodes and dummy nodes. Thus, if there is no set cover of size k, then we can not find k seeds which activate all the element nodes, hence none of the dummy notes are activated. Therefore, the total number of nodes cumulatively activated are no more than n + k.
