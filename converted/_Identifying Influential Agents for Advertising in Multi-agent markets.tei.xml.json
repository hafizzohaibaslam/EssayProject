               "The question of how to influence people in a large social system is a perennial problem in marketing, politics, and publishing. It differs from more personal inter-agent interactions that occur in negotiation and argumentation since network structure and group membership often pay a more significant role than the content of what is being said, making the messenger more important than the message. In this paper, we propose a new method for propagating information through a social system and demonstrate how it can be used to develop a product advertisement strategy in a simulated market. We consider the desire of agents toward purchasing an item as a random variable and solve the influence maximization problem in steady state using an optimization method to assign the advertisement of available products to appropriate messenger agents. Our market simulation accounts for the 1) effects of group membership on agent attitudes 2) has a network structure that is similar to realistic human systems 3) models inter-product preference correlations that can be learned from market data. The results show that our method is significantly better than network analysis methods based on centrality measures."

               "The gift of persuasion is a powerful and highly-sought after skill, as evidenced by the fact that individual self-help books in this area, the most famous being How to Win Friends and Influence People published in 1936, remain popular. The rise of social media outlets and click-through advertisement opened the door for relatively small groups to influence large numbers of people. Combined with modern data analysis techniques, it is possible to create a detailed social simulation of the population of interest, but the problem of whom to influence remains as an open research question. Particularly in advertisement, indiscriminate mass marketing techniques can lead to negative information cascades about product quality, even if cost efficiency is not an issue. This problem can be framed as a network influence propagation problem; previous work in this area has looked at diverse domains such as information propagation in the Flickr social network and identifying important blogs for marketing .",
               "In this paper we present a mathematical analysis of how influence propagation occurs over time and propose a new optimization technique for identifying effective messenger agents in the network that outperforms other network analysis methods while accounting for realistic factors such as group membership and product preference correlation. Following the work of Hung et al. , optimization is used along with an analysis of the expected longterm system behavior to assign the advertisement of the available products to appropriate agents in the network. In contrast with previous work on identifying influential nodes for marketing purposes (e.g., and ), in this work we model the effects of realistic social factors such as group membership on product adoption. In the analysis presented in for counterinsurgency messaging tactics, there exists a single random variable representing the attitude of agents toward counterinsurgency, but in our work, we use a vector of random variables which represents the desire of each agent toward any single product. This consideration combined with product demand correlations in the market make the analysis and optimization more complicated, but ultimately our approach has the promise of being applicable to a wider variety of social systems.",
               "The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the agentbased model and how it can be used for influencing propagation. Section 3 presents our network generation model that is designed to account for social influence factors present in real human societies such as homophily and group membership. The subsequent section presents our analysis of the system dynamics, and our proposed optimization technique is described in Section 5. We evaluate our method vs. a set of centrality based network analysis techniques in Section 6. We end the paper with an overview of related work in this area and a discussion of future work. To explore the efficiency of the proposed marketing method, we have extended a multi-agent system model, inspired by and , to simulate a social system of potential customers. In this model, there is a population of N agents, represented by the set A = {a1, . . . , aN }, that consists of two types of agents (A = ARAP ). The first type of agent, defined as: AR = {ar | ar is Mutable and 1rR}, are the Regular agents, who are the potential customers. These agents have a changing atti- mand of different products in the market. The desire of customers for a specific product is related to his/her desire toward other similar products. To model this correlation and consider its effect in our formulation, we designate a matrix M that identifies the relationship between demands among advertised items and can be shown as:"

This value represents the agents' judgments on other groups and is based on observable group label of the agent rather than real characteristics of the person.

               "Degree Assuming that high-degree nodes are influential nodes in the network is a standard approach for social network analysis. Here, we calculated the probability of joining a Regular agent based on the out-degree of the agents and attached the Product agents according to preferential attachment. Therefore, nodes with higher degree had an increased chance of being selected as an advertising target. In this simulation, the negative effect of advertising products against other products has been increased. This result demonstrates that our proposed method is more robust to the commonly occurring condition where increasing the desire toward one item has a higher negative effect on the desire of agent toward other products.",

Here, we averaged the shortest paths of a node to all the other nodes in the network and sorted the nodes according to this measure. Nodes with shorter average path had a higher chance of being selected as a target.",

               "To evaluate these methods, we started the simulation with an initial desire vector set to 0.02 for all agents, and simulated 10000 iterations of agent interactions. The entire process of interaction and influence is governed based on the previous formulas given in Section 4 and extracted parameters from the network. At each iteration, we calculated the average of the expected desire value of agents toward all products. shows this result for 100 agents and 10 advertisements. As explained before, the desire vector of Product agents are fixed for all products; in our simulation is was set to 1 for the product itself and ?0.05 for all other products (e.g., ?2 = [?0.05 1 ? 0.05 . . . ? 0.05]). The results for this condition show that the proposed method creates a higher total product desire in the social system and is more successful than other methods at selecting influential nodes. To test the robustness of our algorithm we modified the desire vector of Product agents and increased the negative effect of advertisements over other products by factor of three (e.g., ?2 = [?0.15 1 ? 0.15 . . . ? 0.15]). The result of this simulation is shown in . We can see that in this case the average desire of agents has dropped dramatically for all methods except the proposed algorithm. Even in the cases of having high negative effect toward other products, this algorithm can adapt the node selection in a way to keep the desire of agents high and sell more products. The assumption is that an agent with expected desire greater than 0.01 will purchase the product. Different colors in each bar indicates the number of sold items of each advertised products. As there exist ten different products, the bar is divided into ten parts.",
               "To estimate the performance of algorithms in selling the products to Regular agents, we assumed that agents with expected desire higher than a threshold will purchase the product. shows the average of total purchased items by agents with the purchasing threshold as 0.01. Again, we see that our proposed algorithm is the most successful method in advertising and selling products."

One of the ways this can occur is through social influence where a behavior or idea can propagate between friends. In , the authors examine the statistical correlation between the actions of friends in a social network by considering factors such as homophily and possible unobserved confounding variables. Hence it follows that it is not only important to advertise to your customer but also to your potential customer's friends.",
               "One theory about influential nodes is that they can be characterized as a set of initial nodes that trigger behavior cascades. This set of nodes can then be identified either using probabilistic approaches or optimization-based techniques. For example, in the behavior spreads in a cascading fashion according to a probabilistic rule, beginning with a set of initially active nodes. To identify influential agents, they select a set of individuals to target for initial activation, such that the cascade beginning with this active set is as large as possible in expectation. find influential nodes in a complex social network by formulating the likelihood for information diffusion data, the activation time sequence data over all nodes; they propose an iterative method to search for the probabilities that maximize this likelihood.",

               "Agent-based simulation is an important tool for understanding the behavior of social systems, enabling the analysis of populationlevel effects over long time horizons that are not easily studied within the confines of the lab. In this paper, we present a model for researching techniques of large-scale persuasion; rather than focusing on the content of the message, we address the problem of identifying agents that have a high probability of indirectly influencing a large number of additional agents. In popular parlance, these influential agents can be considered to be some mixture of Gladwell's connectors, mavens, and salesman who affect the longterm beliefs of other agents through their actions or communications . Although this problem generalizes to domains such as politics and social media distribution, we demonstrate our method in a market scenario in which product representatives are attempting to maximize their sales through effective advertisement placement. To solve this influence maximization problem, we compute the steady-state expectation of the system and introduce a new optimization approach for selecting influential nodes. Contrary to previous work, our approach is suitable for computing an optimal solution across multiple products and handling the interactions of multiple influencing agents. Our results show that our technique conclusively outperforms a set of centrality-based techniques at selecting influential agents and maximizing total product sales. Our social model accurately reflects many of the complexities of realworld human systems, such as group membership effects, product preference dependencies, and a network structure driven by multiple conflicting forces. Moreover, in our model, an regular agent need not represent an individual person but can be thought of as an abstraction over communities of people. Then larger systems can simply be solved in a hierarchical, but non-exact, fashion. In our future work, we plan to mathematically analyze the short time behavior of the system. This analysis will allow us to generalized our solution technique to a dynamic network whose structure varies over time which is a characteristic possessed by certain realworld social systems."
