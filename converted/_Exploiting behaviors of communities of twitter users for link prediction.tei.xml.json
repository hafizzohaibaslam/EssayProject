               "Currently, online social networks and social media have become increasingly popular showing an exponential growth. This fact have attracted increasing research interest and, in turn, facilitating the emergence of new interdisciplinary research directions, such as social network analysis. In this scenario, link prediction is one of the most important tasks since it deals with the problem of the existence of a future relation among members in a social network. Previous techniques for link prediction were based on structural (or topological) information. Nevertheless, structural information is not enough to achieve a good performance in the link prediction task on large-scale social networks. Thus, the use of additional information, such as interests or behaviors that nodes have into their communities, may improve the link prediction performance. In this paper, we analyze the viability of using a set of simple and non-expensive techniques that combine structural with community information for predicting the existence of future links in a large-scale online social network, such as Twitter. Twitter, a microblogging service, has emerged as a useful source of informative data shared by millions of users whose relationships require no reciprocation. Twitter network was chosen because it is not well understood, mainly due to the occurrence of directed and asymmetric links yet. Experiments show that our proposals can be used efficiently to improve unsupervised and supervised link prediction task in a directed and asymmetric large-scale network."

Social networks offer to their users the possibility of meeting and networking individuals with similar personal and business interests. Online social networking services such as Facebook and Twitter have become part of the daily life of millions of people around the world who maintain and create new social relationships ( ). This fact implies the growth and quick changes over time in underlying structures (vertices and links) of the social networks .",
               "The boundless growth of online social networks has resulted in several research directions that examine the structural and other properties of large-scale social networks that aim to understand the basis of its social structure ( ). Understanding the formation of social relationships can give us insights on how an individual user influences her/his friends ( ).",
               "Detection of hidden social relationships is a friendship suggestion mechanism used by some online social networks. In such case, hidden relationships may consist in existing social ties that have not been established yet in a social network or in social ties missed during social network evolution ( . The problem of predicting the existence of missing relationships or new ones is usually referred to as the link prediction problem . Link prediction has many applications outside the domain of social networks, it is also used in bioinformatics to discover genetic or proteinprotein interactions ( ), e-commerce to build recommendation systems ( ), security domain to assist identifying groups of terrorist or criminals ( ), collaborative domains to assess the influence of a particular individual ( ), information retrieval and information extraction domain to predict words, topics or documents in very large collections of documents ( ), etc.",
               "Since the link prediction problem is relevant for different domains, several techniques have been proposed to cope with it. Thus, the link prediction problem can be addressed in two different strategies: unsupervised and supervised ; Valverde-Rebaza and de Andrade Lopes 2012; ).

According to these experimental results on real networks, methods based on global information can provide higher accuracy than measures based on local information, but their computation is very timeconsuming and usually infeasible for large-scale networks.",
               "On the other hand, methods based on supervised strategy consider the link prediction problem as a classification problem ( ). Thus, network information such as the structural ones and nodes' attributes are used to build a feature vector for each pair of nodes. Feature vectors are used in different classifiers, such as support vector machines , artificial neural networks (Haykin 1998), decision trees (Quinlan 1993), etc., to assign a label to determine if a pair of nodes (a link) there exist or not.",

Thus, with the aim of improving the accuracy of link prediction, ), , and proposed hybrid methods using local structural information and community information. In these proposals, the rationale for using community information in link prediction task is the very definition of community structure, i.e., the existence of high concentration of links within particular groups of nodes, as well as the low concentration of links between these groups. This property of community structure may convey significant information about nodes playing similar behaviors in the network . Besides, in different experiments, found that accuracy of link prediction proposals based only on structural information drastically improves when community structure of networks grows.",

So, in this paper, we focus on microblogging network, which is a particular type of social service. In microblog services, such as Twitter, participants build an explicit social network by ''following'' (subscribing to) another user and thus they automatically receive the (short) messages generated by the target user. Different from some online social networks such as Facebook, a followed user has the option, but not the obligation to similarly follow back ( ; Valverde-Rebaza and de Andrade Lopes 2012; ).",

Our contributions are twofold: (1) We use the measures proposed by Valverde-Rebaza and Lopes in (2012) but performing a more extensive analysis than the performed in (Valverde-Rebaza and de Andrade Lopes 2012), i.e., using link prediction measures in unsupervised and supervised strategies. 2) We analyze the importance of community detection in Twitter and how it improves the link prediction accuracy. Moreover, we compare experimentally the most popular link prediction methods based on local structural information with hybrid measures based on community information.",

Consider the universal set, denoted by U, containing all |V|(|V| -1) potential directed links between every pair of vertices in V, where |V| denotes the number of elements in V. Thus, the fundamental task of a link prediction method is to find out the missing links (future links) in the set U -E (set of non-existent links) assigning a score for each link in this set. The higher the score the higher the connection probability is and vice versa (Land Zhou 2011; ). So, given a predictor, we can rank all the non-existent links according to their scores. To test the accuracy of the predictor, the set E is divided into two parts: the training set E T is treated as known information, while the testing set (probe set) E P is used for testing and no information therein is allowed to be used for prediction. Clearly, E = E T [ E Clearly, higher precision means higher prediction accuracy.",

Let n be the number of independent where |TP|, |TN|, |FP| and |FN| represent true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives rates, respectively.",
               "It is important to note here that the precision from unsupervised methods is calculated differently than for supervised methods but in both cases indicates the number of existent links correctly predicted with respect to a set of analyzed links. Furthermore, the unsupervised evaluation measures are applied directly on results of link prediction measures but supervised evaluation measures are applied on results of classifiers.",
               "Link prediction measures based on similarity can be classified into different ways, such as the measures based on local or global structural information. Measures based on global information use all available information on the network, and thus, may lead to higher accuracy. However, the global measures computation is very time-consuming and usually infeasible for large-scale networks. On the other hand, local measures are generally faster, but provide lower accuracy compared to the global ones .",

This graph has 12 vertices and 19 links between them. Each node is labeled with its index, for easy identification.

At each iteration, a pass over all vertices, in a random order, is performed: each vertex takes the label shared by the majority of its neighbors. If there is no unique majority, one of the majority labels is select at random. In this way, labels are propagated across the graph. The process converges when each vertex has the majority label of its neighborhood, or a maximum number of iteration is achieved. Communities are defined as groups of vertices having identical labels at convergence. After the process, each vertex has more neighbors in its community than in any other community.",

Due to the many relationships encountered along the detection process it is possible to derive different partitions starting from the same initial condition.

Results of show for J48, SMO and MLP classifiers the best Accuracy results are obtained in VTotal data set, i.e., the data set that combines all local measures and all measures based on community information. For NB classifier the best result is in VTop data set, i.e., the data set that uses the five best link prediction measures according to the results of . Results of show for J48, NB, SMO and MLP classifiers the best F-measure results also are obtained in VTotal data set. Furthermore, for NB classifier the best F-measure result also is obtained in VTop data set.",

This happens mainly when all local measures and all measures based on community information are combined into a feature vector, i.e., in VTotal data set."

               "We use different link prediction measures on two different directed graphs built from a Twitter network. For predicting a link between a pair of nodes, the WIC measure takes into account the information on which communities the pair of nodes (and their neighbors) belong to, i.e., if the nodes are in a same community or in different ones. The W form measures consider the neighborhood information of nodes belonging only to the same community of the pair of nodes analyzed.",
               "Since for applying the WIC and W form measures is need, in a previous phase, partitioning the network into communities. Here we use a fast community detection algorithm, the LPA, to be able of applying the WIC and W form measures for large-scale networks.",
               "When an unsupervised strategy is performed, the performance of WIC compared to other measures was better under the AUC criterion. Also, all the W form measures outperform their respective basic counterpart and also are positioned among the measures with better performance. Notice that, in the analysis by on complex networks of different domains, PA obtained the worst performance, but, in the case of Twitter network analyzed in this work, Jac had the worst performance.",
               "When analyzing precision, highlight RA-W, AA-W and WIC, which outperform the others. These three measures are characterized by uniform performance in the different L values, especially WIC, which has a sustained growth up to L = 5,000. Here, PA obtained the worst performance in all L values.",
               "When a supervised strategy is performed, our results show that combining measures based on local information and based on community information will improve the performance of classifiers. But the improvement may not be significant because the selection processes for generating feature vectors of data sets are diverse, so how to select the most appropriate links for a supervised strategy is a challenging problem.",
               "Since our analysis was performed on a online large-scale social network, such as Twitter, consider the time execution is important. Thus, for our unsupervised link prediction process, PA is the fastest measure, but has the penultimate position in AUC analysis and the ultimate position in precision analysis. WIC is the second fastest and has the best performance in AUC analysis besides being one of the first in the precision analysis. Besides, W form measures are slightly slower than their respective basic forms, but outperform them in AUC and precision analyses.",
               "In summary, our experiments suggest that WIC and W form measures capture information from the behaviors of users into the communities which they belong, improving the link prediction performance for directed and asymmetric large-scale networks. This happens because nodes of the same communities likely have similar interests or behaviors. In the case of the Twitter network, the similar interests or behaviors between users may be a preference for following other users with the same topics of interest, following the same celebrities, or dissemination of tweets containing certain type of hashtags, among others."
