               "A new link prediction method using active learning technique, named HALLP, is proposed in this paper. The method provides the user with most useful examples from the large number of unlabeled examples (i.e. unlinked node pairs in the network) for query. Once labeled by users, these examples will be fed to the learner for the improvement of the link predictor in next round. The utility of an example is decided by its uncertainty measure calculated simultaneously by its local structure and its hierarchical structure in networks. Experiments indicate link prediction method can be improved with the use of active learning techniques and both the local structure and global structure are beneficial for selecting examples with high utility."

               "The network (for example, online social networks, email networks, communication networks, and biological networks, etc.) and its applications have penetrated into every aspect of human life. The needs to develop new applications based on potential information from the massive network data are also increased. For example, in bioinformatics area, the prediction of relation and regulation of proteins can guide the experiment designers to discover new biological factors . As a critical research sub-field of link mining, link prediction is concerned with the problem of predicting unknown portion (or the future structure) of the network from the known portion of the network. Different from traditional data mining tasks, link prediction investigates not only the attributes of individual nodes, but also the relationships among nodes. Link prediction has a wide range of application scenarios, such as bibliographic domains, recommendation systems and criminal investigations. In citation networks, for example, scholars can find the papers potentially useful to cite and managers can identify future core papers with the help of link prediction .",
               "The classic link prediction framework is under the (semi-)supervised learning setup where a model is trained with an existing dataset composed of examples (i.e. node pairs) annotated with certain attributes. However, link prediction in sparse networks presents a significant challenge due to the inherent disproportion of links that can form to links that do form . Further exploration on a large number of unlinked node pairs, most of which are unlabeled examples, may improve the performance of link prediction.",
               "The paper proposes to use active learning technique to select the most possible useful unlabeled examples from all unlabeled examples. These examples will first be labeled with the assistance of the users. The predictor will then be retrained with the updated set of examples and could be further improved. One of the advantages of active learning is that it can minimize the amount of labeled data without sacrificing much quality of the learned models . Thus the users in the networks will not be bothered too much in the labeling process. The link prediction method proposed in this paper is named HALLP -Hybrid Active Learning approach for Link Prediction. HALLP identifies the examples with higher utility from unlabeled examples in networks to query. The utility of the example in networks is decided by both local structure and global structure of the example in networks, which will be described in details later.",

Therefore, these examples are treated as unlabeled instead of negative in this paper. The paper aims to employ active learning techniques to better use the abundant unlabeled examples in networks. Active learning attempts to achieve better accuracy by posing queries in the form of unlabeled examples to be labeled by users. Actually, queries can be obtained in a natural way with the activity of users in networks. For example, in online social network, a user can be recommended with some possible friends, and a feedback can be given to the system once the user gives the confirmation. It is a reasonable way to predict links in an active learning process.",

At each step, a batch of k examples in U are selected and labeled, and then added to the labeled corpus L and removed from U. One of the general techniques in active learning is uncertainty sampling, which is to select examples that are most uncertain for the current model . In this paper, uncertain sampling is used in the poolbased active learning cycle.",

Let U denote the unlabeled data set, and L denotes the labeled data set, L P N =. P and N denote the set of positive examples and negative examples, respectively. Negative examples can be sampled from U because the majority of examples in U are labeled negative. In this paper, training examples are sampled from L and U in a simple random manner considering the large scale of network data. But certainly, other sampling methods can be tried to select more possible negative examples."

The geometrical ROC graphs of five methods for Enron dataset are shown in (a) and the geometrical ROC graphs of four methods for DBLP dataset are shown in . shows that for Enron dataset the accuracy of ALLP-SVM is better than Random-SVM in all settings of k. It is noticed that the accuracy values of both ALLP-SVM and Random-SVM are quite small when n is small in the setting of k=50 and 100. It is because the overall number of training data is too small to get an efficient predictor. But when k is 500, the number of training data is big enough to get a predictor with a better accuracy. shows that for Enron dataset the accuracy of ALLP-SVM is evidently better than Random-SVM when n=500 and 1000. When n is 100, the accuracy of ALLP-SVM has no significant improvement compared with Random-SVM. From the shape of the curves, the performance of ALLP-SVM is more stable than Random-SVM. With increasing of k, the accuracy of both methods did not significantly increase. It is inconsistent with our expect that the more examples to query the users the higher the accuracy of the learner. shows that for Enron dataset the ROC curve of HALLP is overall higher than Random-SVM, ALLP-SVM, LP-HS and LinkPro. ALLP-SVM is slightly worse than HALLP but much better than LP-HS and LinkPro. Notice that LP-HS does not perform as well as we expected. One possible reason is that the link prediction method based on hierarchical clustering is not applicable for all types of networks and especially for small-scale networks. For DBLP dataset, the ROC curve of HALLP is lightly better than the curve of ALLP-SVM, but much better than the curve of Random-SVM and LP-HS. The AUC values were also calculated for , which also show that HALLP performs better than other methods in most situations.

In this paper, the negative examples in the training set are only sampled randomly from the whole unlabeled dataset, which might produce some false negative examples and deteriorate the accuracy of the learner. In future work, the method can be improved by selectively sampling the unlabeled examples according to some semi-supervised methods. Besides, the real world networks are dynamic and the data in networks is better viewed as a sequence of snapshots of an evolving graph or as a continuous time process . Whether or not the active learning process can be effectively merged into the link prediction in dynamic networks is another problem to be considered."
