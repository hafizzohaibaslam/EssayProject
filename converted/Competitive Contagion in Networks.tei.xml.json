The payoffs to the firms are the eventual number of adoptions of their product through a competitive stochastic diffusion process in the network. This framework yields a rich class of competitive strategies, which depend in subtle ways on the stochastic dynamics of adoption, the relative budgets of the players, and the underlying structure of the social network.",

We also introduce a new notion, the Budget Multiplier , that measures the extent that imbalances in player budgets can be amplified at equilibrium. We again identify a general property of the adoption dynamics -namely, proportional local adoption between competitors -for which the (pure strategy) Budget Multiplier is uniformly bounded above, across all networks.

               "In this work, we study competition between firms who use their resources to maximize product adoption by consumers located in a social network. The social network may transmit information about products, and adoption of products by neighbors may have direct consumption benefits. The firms, denoted Red and Blue, know the graph which defines the social network and offer similar or interchangeable products or services. The two firms simultaneously choose to allocate their resources on subsets of consumers, i.e., to seed the network with initial adoptions. The stochastic dynamics of local adoption determine how the influence of each player's seeds spreads throughout the graph to create new adoptions. Our work thus builds upon recent interest in models of competitive contagion .",
               "A distinctive feature of our framework is that we allow for a broad class of local influence processes. We decompose the dynamics into two parts: a switching function f , which specifies the probability of a consumer switching from non-adoption to adoption as a function of the fraction of his neighbors who have adopted either of the two products Red and Blue; and a selection function g, which specifies, conditional on switching, the probability that the consumer adopts (say) Red as function of the fraction of adopting neighbors who have adopted Red. Each firm seeks to maximize the total number of consumers who adopt its product. Broadly speaking, the switching function captures \"stickiness\" of the (interchangeable) products based on their local prevalence, and the selection function captures preference for firms based on local market share.",
               "This framework yields a rich class of competitive strate-gies, which depend in subtle ways on the dynamics, the relative budgets of the players, and the structure of the social network (Section 4 gives some warm-up examples illustrating this point). Here we focus on understanding two general features of equilibrium: first, the efficiency of resource use by the players (Price of Anarchy) and second, the role of the network and dynamics in amplifying ex-ante resource differences between the players (Budget Multiplier).",
               "Our first set of results concern efficiency of resource use by the players. For a fixed graph and fixed local dynamics (given by f and g), and budgets of KR and KB seed infections for the players, let (SR, SB) be the sets of seed infections that maximize the joint expected infections (payoffs)R(SR, SB) +B(SR, SB) subject to |SR| = KR and |SB| = KB, and letR andB be Nash equilibrium strategies obeying the budget constraints that minimize the joint payoffR(R,B) +B(R,B) across all Nash equilibria. The Price of Anarchy (or PoA) is then defined as:",

               "Our first main result, Theorem 1, shows that if the switching function f is concave and the selection function g is linear, then the PoA is uniformly bounded above by 4, across all networks. The main proof technique we employ is the construction of certain coupled stochastic dynamical processes that allow us to demonstrate that, under the assumptions on f and g, the departure of one player can only benefit the other player, even though the total number of joint infections can only decrease. This in turn lets us argue that players can successfully defect to the maximum social welfare solution and realize a significant fraction of its payoff, thus implying they must also do so at equilibrium. Our next main result, Theorem 2, shows that even a small amount of convexity in the switching function f can lead to arbitrarily high PoA. This result is obtained by constructing a family of layered networks whose dynamics effectively compose f many times, thus amplifying its convexity. Equilibrium and large PoA are enforced by the fact that despite this amplification, the players are better off playing near each other: this means that if one player locates in one part of the network, the other player has an incentive to locate close by, even if they would jointly be better off locating in a different part of the network. Taken together, our PoA upper and lower bounds yield sharp threshold behavior in a parametric classes of dynamics. For example, if the switching function is f (x) = x r for r > 0 and the selection function g is linear, then for all r1 the PoA is at most 4, while for any r > 1 it can be unbounded."

We The PoA is a measure of the maximum potential inefficiency created by non-cooperative/decentralized activity. In our context, if we suppose that consumers get positive utility from consumption of firms' products then the PoA also reflects losses in consumer welfare. The Price of Stability (PoS) compares outcomes in the 'best' equilibrium with socially optimal outcomes; one may interpret the PoS as a measure of the minimum inefficiency created by non-cooperative, as opposed to merely decentralized, activity. Heidari , adapting the proofs presented here, has recently shown that as with PoA, even slight convexity of the switching function is sufficient to generate arbitrarily large PoS. among all Nash equilibria (R,B); this quantity is just the ratio of the final payoffs divided by the ratio of the initial budgets. The resulting maximized quantity is the Budget Multiplier, and it measures the extent to which the larger budget player can obtain a final market share that exceeds their share of the initial budgets.",

               "Our next result, Theorem 5, shows that even a slight departure from linearity in the selection function can yield unbounded Budget Multiplier. The proof again appeals to network structures that amplify the nonlinearity of g by self-composition, which has the effect of \"squeezing out\" the player with smaller budget. Combining the Budget Multiplier upper and lower bounds again allows us to exhibit simple parametric forms yielding threshold behavior: for instance, if f is linear and g is from the well-studied Tullock contest function family (discussed shortly), which includes linear g and therefore bounded Budget Multiplier, even an infinitesimal departure from linearity can result in unbounded Budget Multiplier. Related Literature. Our paper contributes to the study of competitive strategy in network environments. We build a framework which combines ideas from economics (contests, competitive seeding and advertising) and computer science -uniform bounds on properties of equilibria, as in the Price of Anarchy -to address a topical and natural question. The Tullock contest function was introduced in Tullock ; for an axiomatic development see Skaperdas . For early and influential studies of competitive advertising, see Butters and Grossman and Shapiro . The Price of Anarchy (PoA) was introduced by Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou , and important early results bounding the PoA in networked settings regardless of network structure were given by Roughgarden and Tardos . The tension between equilibrium and Nash efficiency is a recurring theme in economics; for a general result on the inefficiency of Nash equilibria, see Dubey .",

This has been an active field of study in the last decade, see e.g., Ballester, Calvo-Armengol and Zenou ; Bharathi, Kempe and Salek ; Galeotti and Goyal ; Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos ; Mossel and Roch ; Borodin, Filmus, and Oren ; Chasparis and Shamma ; Carnes et al ; Dubey, Garg and De Meyer ; Vetta . There are three elements in our framework which appear to be novel: one, we consider a fairly general class of adoption rules at the individual consumer level which correspond to different roles which social interaction can potentially play (existing work often considers specific local dynamics); two, we study competition for influence in a network (existing work has often focused on the case of a single player seeking to maximize influence), and three, we introduce and study the notion of Budget Multiplier as a measure of how networks amplify budget differences. To the best of our knowledge, our results on the relationship between the dynamics and qualitative features of the strategic equilibrium are novel. Nevertheless, there are definite points of contact between our results and proof techniques and earlier research in (single-player and competitive) contagion in networks that we shall elaborate on where appropriate."

We shall also use R, B and U (ninfected) to denote the state of a vertex in G, according to whether it is currently infected by one of the two players or uninfected. The two players simultaneously choose some number of vertices to initially seed; after this seeding, the stochastic dynamics of local adoption (discussed below) determine how each player's seeds spread throughout G to create adoptions by new nodes. Each player seeks to maximize their (expected) total number of eventual adoptions.",
               "The primary simplifying assumption we shall make about this schedule is that once a vertex is infected, it is never a candidate for updating again.",
               "Within this constraint, we allow for a variety of behaviors, such as randomly choosing an uninfected vertex to update at each time step (a form of sequential updating), or updating all uninfected vertices simultaneously at each time step (a form of parallel updating). We can also allow for an immunity property -if a vertex is exposed once to infection and remains uninfected after updating, it is never updated again. Update schedules may also have finite termination times or conditions -for instance, if the firms primarily care about the number of adoptions in the coming fiscal year. We can also allow schedules that update each uninfected vertex only a fixed number of times. Note that a schedule which perpetually updates uninfected vertices will eventually cause any connected G to become entirely infected, thus trivializing the PoA (though not necessarily the Budget Multiplier), but we allow for considerably more general schedules. More precisely, suppose that player p = R, B has budget KpN+; Each player p chooses an allocation of budget across the n vertices, ap = (ap1, ap2, ..., apn), where apjN+ and n j=1 apj = Kp. Let Ap be the set of allocations for player p, which is their pure strategy space. A mixed strategy for player p is a probability distributionp on Ap. Let Ap denote the set of probability distributions for player p. The two players simultaneously choose their strategies (R,B). Consider any realized initial allocation (aR, aB) for the two players. Let V (aR) = {v|avR > 0}, V (aB) = {v|avB > 0} and let V (aR, aB) = V (aR)V (aB). A vertex v becomes initially infected if one or more players assigns a seed to infect v. If both players assign seeds to the same vertex, then the probability of initial infection by a player is proportional to the seeds allocated by the player (relative to the other player). More precisely, fix any allocation (aR, aB). For any vertex v, the initial state sv of v is in {R, B} if and only if vV (aR, aB). Moreover, sv = R with probability avR/(avR + avB), and sv = B with probability avB/(avR + avB).",

More precisely, letR andB be the fraction of v's neighbors infected by R and B, respectively, at the time of the update, and let=R +B be the total fraction of infected neighbors.

Note that since the selection step above requires that an infection take place, we also have g(y)+g(1?y) = 1, which implies g(1/2) = 1/2.

Consider the choice h(x, y) = x(1 ? y 2 ); it is easily verified that the total probability of adoption H(x, y) is increasing in x and y. But H(x, y) clearly cannot be expressed as a function of the form f (x + y). Similarly, it is easy to construct an adoption function that is not only not decomposable, but violates monotonicity. Imagine consumers that prefer to adopt the majority choice in their neighborhood, but will only adopt once their local neighborhood market is sufficiently settled in favor of one or the other product. The probability of total adoption may then be higher with x = 0.2, y = 0 as compared to x = y = 0.4."

By choosing N K we can ignore the infections in the chain and just focus on the terminal vertices, which will be won by whichever player infects the final chain vertex.

In fact, even if we let L K, Blue's payoff will still be a factor of 1/2 K smaller than Red's.
