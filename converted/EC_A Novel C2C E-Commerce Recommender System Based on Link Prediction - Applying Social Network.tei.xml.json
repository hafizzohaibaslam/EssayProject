               "Social network analysis emerged as an important research topic in sociology decades ago, and it has also attracted scientists from various fields of study like psychology, anthropology, geography and economics. In recent years, a significant number of researches has been conducted on using social network analysis to design e-commerce recommender systems. Most of the current recommender systems are designed for B2C e-commerce websites. This paper focuses on building a recommendation algorithm for C2C e-commerce business model by considering special features of C2C e-commerce websites. In this paper, we consider users and their transactions as a network; by this mapping, link prediction technique which is an important task in social network analysis could be used to build the recommender system. The proposed tow-level recommendation algorithm, rather than topology of the network, uses nodes' features like: category of items, ratings of users, and reputation of sellers. The results show that the proposed model can be used to predict a portion of future trades between users in a C2C commercial network. Recommendation based on best-selling items, demographic information of users, and user's past behavior analysis, are samples of techniques used by Recommender systems in e-commerce websites [2]. These techniques can be considered as different types of personalization, since they help the website to adapt itself to the customers. Although most of commercial websites use B2C e-commerce, some of them support C2C e-commerce. Ebay.com, Bizrate.com, etc. are instances of websites in which customers can be buyer and seller at the same time. Current recommendation algorithms (e.g. collaborative filtering, content based algorithms, and hybrid algorithms) can be most useful for B2C e-commerce websites. Since these algorithms only concentrate on items and consumers (but not sellers), there is a lack of recommender systems for C2C e-commerce websites [3]."

               "In recent years, moving from mass production toward mass customization has been an important factor for success of companies in global markets. In other words, diversity and customization of products have replaced long life time and standardized products. The emersion of electronic commerce has facilitated their movement toward personalization of products. In order to expand personalization, companies need to increase the amount of information that users should process before choosing their ideal items. This phenomenon which is known as Information overload problem, was the main reason of developing recommender systems in e-commerce .",
               "The solution proposed in this paper for the mentioned problem is based on social network analysis. Social network analysis emerged as an important research topic in sociology decades ago, and its first studies was focused on the adoption of medical and agricultural innovations . It is a vast field of research that has attracted researchers from anthropology, economics, psychology, biology and geography, just to mention a few. Link prediction which is an important task in social network analysis, is the problem of predicting the existence of a link between two nodes in a graph where prediction is based on the attributes of the nodes and other observed links .",
               "In this paper, we are going to design a recommender system which can be used in commercial networks. A commercial network is a graph which its nodes represent users of a C2C ecommerce website and edges represent the transactions between these users. If we presume transactions between users as edges of a graph, link prediction approaches can be used to design the recommender system. But before using link prediction techniques, the nature of network should be identified and analyzed. Since the context of links in commercial networks are different from links in common social networks, we must adapt link prediction approaches to our problem. So far, several nodes proximity measures are introduced for link prediction in common social networks (e.g. Adamic-Adar, FOAF, etc. ) but as we will discuss in section III, many of them are not applicable for being used in our model.",
               "The main goal of this paper is to propose a model for predicting future trades between users in a commercial network. If G1(U,E1) is the transactions graph in time t1 (U is the set of nodes and E1 is the set of graph edges in time t1). We are going to predict edges of the graph in time t2 (t1<t2). So we should predict the graph G2(U,E2) in time t2 where the difference between G1 and G2 is in their edges. Predicting these new links and using them in a recommender system could have two benefits: first, such recommender system can accelerate formation of trades between users and this can benefit all involving parties, i.e. buyers and sellers and third parties. Second, recommending a user to buy an item from another user can end up to a trade that was not going to happen in future at all. Another goal that we are going to seek is to predict items sold in future trades. Since the ultimate goal of this paper is recommending items of sellers to target users, we should choose the most appropriate item of the sellers to increase the probability of accepting recommendations.",
               "In, Arazy et al. proposed a framework for improving social recommender systems using behavioral theories of advice-taking. They identified four factors that impact a user's decision when he receives a recommendation: Homophily, Trust, Reputation, and Tie strength. After computing these relationship factors, the system should calculate a weighted average of them in order to rate each recommendation source. Then these sources could be used to recommend items to users. In , Guy et al. studied personalized recommendation of social software items, including bookmarked web-pages, blog entries, and communities. They focused on recommendations that are derived from the user's social network. In their proposed model, Social network information is collected and aggregated across different data sources. A group recommendation system is proposed In . The system makes recommendations based on supervised entropy, association rules and D-Tree classification method.",
               "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section II, we briefly review some of previous works on link prediction problem in social networks and recommendation algorithms for C2C websites. Section III contains our proposed methodology for solving the problem ahead. In section IV we discuss the experiments we performed and the data used in experiments. Results are presented in section V, and finally in section VI we present conclusions and future works.",
               "II. RELATED WORK So far, plenty of research has been done in the field of link prediction and item recommendation in common social networks, but just a few of them has focused on commercial networks. In , a recommendation model for C2C online trading is proposed. The author divides user's behaviors in a C2C website into four categories: browse, attention, bidding, and purchase. Based on these criteria, a users' preference matrix is built. Afterwards, similarity between current active users and other users is calculated. Finally Top-N recommendation list is built for each user based on most important items for his neighbors. Three-dimensional collaborative filtering is another method for recommending items in C2C commercial networks which is introduced in ; They extended the traditional collaborative filtering technique to solve the recommendation problem in C2C e-commerce websites. Their proposed recommender system firstly calculates seller similarities using seller features, and fills the rating matrix based on seller similarities. Then it calculates the buyer similarities using historical ratings, and defines neighbors of each user to predict unknown ratings. Eventually, the system recommends the seller and product combinations with the highest prediction ratings to the target user.",
               "Unlike item recommendation in C2C commercial networks, a large number of researches has been done on link prediction and link recommendation in common social networks. Some works have used only network's topology for predicting new links. Nowell et al. in , state that link prediction could be done just by using topological features. They used three different methods to predict missing links: Methods Based on Node Neighborhoods, Methods Based on the Ensemble of All Paths, and Higher Level Approaches. In , de Set al. investigated the effect of using supervised learning approaches on weighted graphs. They used pairs of nodes as instances of binary classification problem in which the predictor attributes were metrics computed from the network topology, and the target attribute was the presence or absence of a link between the nodes in future. Link prediction using hybrid approaches is investigated in many of prior works. Yin et al. proposed a framework for link recommendation based on attribute and structural properties in a social network. They enumerated six criteria for link recommendation: homophily, rarity, Social influence, common friendship, social closeness, and preferential attachment. In , Chen et al. compared the performance of different people recommendation in predicting and recommending potential friends. The comparison was between four algorithms: content matching, content plus link, friend of a friend, and SONAR.",
               "To the best of our knowledge, except , none of the previous researches about item recommendation in C2C ecommerce websites are focused on choosing appropriate seller for target users, and this is one of the main difference between this work and previous works. Besides, this paper uses link prediction technique for recommending items in C2C ecommerce websites, an approach that has not been used in previous researches about C2C e-commerce recommender system."

Considering definition of the problem, we cannot directly use these metrics.

So in this stage, a different approach must be used. SimRank is a similarity measures proposed for directed graphs. This measure which is proposed by , computes similarities based on an intuitive concept: two objects are similar if they refer to similar objects or they are referred by similar objects.

In random item suggestion, a random item from selling items of a seller is selected and in Best-selling item suggestion, we select the best selling item of the seller. For applying association rules, we use the list of items that users have purchased so far. So we use a-priori algorithm to find strong rules and considering these rules, we select items from selling items each seller; If no rules could be used for item selection, we use random selection for suggesting items. The simplest form of recommendation is suggesting a single item. A single item would increase the chance that the customer will accept the suggestion. But most of the recommender systems provide a list of suggestions for customers. A list of items can increase the probability that user's desired item shows up in the list of items .

               "Online stores need an efficient e-marketing strategy. Modeling users' behavior and recommending items based on their interests is one of the most efficient strategies in ecommerce. Over time, recommender systems are becoming an inseparable component of e-commerce websites. But unfortunately, most of the current recommendation models could only be used in B2C e-commerce websites. In this paper, we proposed a recommender system for C2C e-commerce websites using prior transactions of users, categories of items, rating of users, and reputation of sellers. The goal of the system is recommending items from most appropriate sellers to target customers. The Results of our experiments show that the proposed model can predict some of the missing links in commercial networks. The portion of predicted links by our model may seem to be low, but one should consider that even this low percent can end up to a big number of new transactions in large scale commercial networks. It should be noted that using different datasets for experiments may have significant effects on results, as the scale of our dataset was too large. Similar to other recommendation models, a challenge for our model is recommending items to new users (cold start). There are several ways to deal with this problem: recommending items from sellers who have sold most items in the network, sellers who have best reputation in the network and recommending items from random sellers are some common solutions for the problem. The final form of the recommendation, is a list of items from different sellers, so we should measure the performance of model at predicting items too. shows the f-measure of proposed model at item prediction using the three methods discussed in section III. As you see in the table, best-selling items method is having the best performance among others. But this method lacks personalization in recommending items to users. The performance of association rules method is being weak and almost close to random prediction method. The reason for this weak performance can be the weakness of extracted rules.",
               "The proposed model can be improved in several ways. The results of related works shows that considering time element in recommendations, can improve performance of recommender systems , . So investigating the effect of using time in predictions is one of the future works. As the effect of using weight of links in a graph for link prediction is not deterministic yet , other possible future work can be using the weight of links between users for computing similarities at the stage of creating candidates list.
