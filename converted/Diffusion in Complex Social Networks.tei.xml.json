               "This paper studies the problem of spreading a product (an idea, cultural fad or technology) among agents in a social network. An agent obtains the product with a probability that depends on the spreading rate of the product as well as on the behavior of the agent's neighbors. This paper shows, using a mean field approach, that there exists a threshold for the spreading rate that determines whether the product spreads and becomes persistent or it does not spread and vanishes. This threshold depends crucially on the connectivity distribution of the network and on the mechanism of diffusion. for valuable comments and suggestions.

               "Introducing a new product, technology or idea in the market is an issue of major socialeconomic relevance. Innovations do not necessarily spread at once, but often spread gradually through social and geographic networks. In fact, many products promote rather easily in a social system through a domino effect. In a first stage a few innovators adopt the product, and this makes more likely that their neighbors do the same, then their neighbors' neighbors and so forth. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that individuals' opinion heavily depends on the opinion of their interpersonal ties. Indeed, most products spread more efficiently due to \"consumer-to-consumer dialogue\" since these communication channels are more trusted and have greater effectiveness than mass media advertisements.",
               "Another feature that favors diffusion is the coordination effect. In fact, there are many cases where in order to exploit the benefits of your product, you have to coordinate in your decision with your neighbors. A recent example is that of the mobile phones. They became popular in the mid 90's and, at present, almost every individual possesses a phone, which is considered as an essential commodity in developed countries. Apart from the intrinsic advantages that the new product might provide to its users, the fast spreading of it in the population is reinforced by more subtle aspects, such as fashion and benefits from coordinating in the decision with your contacts. Traditional marketing is being replaced by new strategies in which the product is turned into \"epidemics\" where consumers do the marketing themselves. This phenomenon shares common features with the contagion of an infectious disease in a population. The aim of this paper is to generalize existing epidemic models in order to accommodate them to describe diffusion in social and economic contexts.",
               "In particular, we address the following question: How does the spreading pattern depend on the properties of the social network and on the diffusion (or contagion) mechanism?",
               "We consider a large population with a complex pattern of interaction among agents. In fact, the population is described as a network structure where individuals (nodes) interact exclusively with a fixed group of neighbors (nodes with whom they are directly linked).",
               "Traditionally, the study of networks has been a topic of graph theory. Graph theory, however, has concentrated in small networks with a high degree of regularity. This paper, however, focuses on the large-scale statistical properties of the network instead of on the properties of single vertices. For instance, the number of edges a node has -the connectivity of the node-is characterized by a distribution function P (k), which gives the probability that a randomly selected node has exactly k edges. We assume that the precise topology of the network is unknown and thus it is considered as a \"random ensemble\". These networks are referred as \"random networks\". The seminal papers on random networks developed by , define a random graph by a group of N nodes such that every pair of nodes is connected with a certain probability p > 0. The graphs generated in this manner have a binomial connectivity distribution which tends to a Poisson distribution, as the size of the population tends to infinity. Hence, this distribution has its peak at the average connectivity. In other words, the majority of nodes have a similar connectivity.",
               "Recent studies, however, show that most large complex networks are characterized by a connectivity distribution different to a Poisson distribution (e.g., ; ). For instance, the world wide web, Internet or the network of human sexual contacts, among others, have a power-law connectivity distribution, i.e. P (k) ? k ?whereranges between 2 and 3. This implies that each node has a statistically significant probability of having a very large number of connections compared to the average connectivity which generates an extreme heterogeneity in the connectivity of agents. Such random networks are called scale-free. In this paper we focus on generalized random networks. These networks are random, in the sense that the link formation process is still determined in a stochastically independent fashion across nodes.",
               "However, the underlying connectivity distribution is allowed to be arbitrary. Therefore, the \"Erdos and Renyi \" (Poisson) random networks, as well as the scale-free (power-law) random networks simply become particular cases of this general setup. Although this work attempts to be of general applicability, we pay special attention to the differential properties of Poisson and scale-free networks, due to their long tradition in the literature on social networks.",
               "We therefore consider agents are connected by means of a generalized random network. Each agent, classified as either an \"active\" or a \"potential\" consumer, is represented by a node in the network. The transition from a potential to an active consumer depends on the intrinsic properties of the product as well as on the number and behavior of neighbors. Conversely, an active consumer becomes potential at an exogenously given rate. This reflects the idea that the technology in question is subject to a decay, obsolescence or breakdown. Therefore, with a certain probability, independent of the behavior of neighbors, an agent may need to replace the product and hence may become a potential consumer again.",
               "The framework considered in this work is closely related to the so-called \"susceptibleinfected-susceptible\" (SIS) model, commonly used in epidemiology. Some paradigmatic examples that are described using the SIS model are the diffusion of sexually transmitted diseases in a sexual contact network or the spreading of a computer virus via Internet (e.g., ). Each agent is represented by a node and can be either \"healthy\" or \"infected\". In each time step a healthy node is infected at a certain rate if it is directly connected to at least one infected agent. Conversely, an infected agent is cured at another certain rate. This paper extends the SIS model by introducing a richer framework to reflect local dependencies or neighborhood effects. Unlike epidemiological models, where contagion events between pairs of individuals are independent, the effect that a single infected neighbor has on a given node depends critically on the states of the node's other neighbors. The SIS model considers the contagion of a disease as a linear function of the absolute number of infected neighbors, whereas the present model allows for non-linear mechanisms. Indeed, we could consider a concave mechanism where adding more active consumers in the neighborhood of an agent increases the chances that the agent becomes active, but with a decreasing marginal impact. Furthermore, the intensity of each interaction could depend on the total number of interactions. In other words, the more neighbors an agent has, the less significant any one of them becomes. Consequently, the contagion mechanism is not necessarily expressed in terms of the absolute number of a node's neighbors adopting the product, but could instead depend on the corresponding fraction of the neighborhood. One of the objectives of this work is to account for the differences in the results as we vary the mechanism of diffusion.",
               "The theoretical results of our model are derived using the so-called mean field theory. This approach is commonly used in physics and biology since it provides a reasonable guide of the qualitative behavior of complex systems. Heuristically, it is a continuous time system where all decisions happen for certain at a rate proportional to the mean. Moreover, it simplifies the description of the exact contagion process by substituting local variables of the dynamics by their global mean values.",
               "We show, using the mean field theory, that there exists a threshold for the degree of contagion (or spreading rate) of the product, such that, above the threshold the technology spreads and becomes persistent. This threshold depends crucially on two features: the mechanism of diffusion and the connectivity distribution of agents in the population. We also show that, when the contagion of the product only depends on the absolute number of active consumers among neighbors (i.e. the effect of the size of the neighborhood is absent), then networks with a higher variance have lower thresholds. Consequently, the diffusion of the product is easier and greater in scale-free networks than in Poisson networks, as expected from the recent empirical results (e.g., ). In contrast, if the intensity of each interaction decreases in parallel with the number of neighbors, i.e. , the contagion of the product depends on the relative proportion of active consumers among neighbors, the results change significantly. In particular, if the probability that an individual becomes active is proportional to the fraction of neighboring active consumers, the threshold coincides for all networks. Finally, for concave diffusion functions there always exists a continuous transition from the absence to the existence of diffusion, whereas for some particular non-concave diffusion functions, a phase transition or hysteresis phenomenon occurs.",
               "The formal framework considered in this paper is close to the literature on epidemiology and complex systems, mentioned above, where the mean field theory is often used. The inspiration for this work, however, comes mainly from the literature on social and economic networks. Recent instances of this literature show that the pattern of interaction between individuals is crucial in determining the nature of outcomes. A wide number of papers have focused on the analysis of lattices; that is, regular networks in which all players have the same number of direct connections (e.g., . One step beyond comes from Morris (2000) who has developed techniques to study coordination games in general networks, and from Calv-Armengol and Jackson (2004) who deal with the diffusion of information on job opportunities in a population. The present paper shares a flavour with Morris (2000) and Calv-Armengol and Jackson but introduces important novelties. First, we study very general contagion mechanisms characterized by the fact that the transition from one individual state to the other (active to potential consumer and vice versa) is stochastic and asymmetric. Second, we consider complex random networks rather than networks with a deterministic geometric form.",
               "The paper is organized as follows. The model is contained in Section 2. Section 3 introduces the mean field theory. The main results of the paper are presented in Section 4. Then, we introduce some stylized examples in Section 5. Further results are considered in Section 6 and in Section 7 we run some simulations of the original dynamics in order to test the validity of the results based on the mean field theory. Finally, Section 8 concludes. Some proofs have been relegated to an Appendix."

It is straightforward to show that, given (A-1) the state with no active consumers (= 0) is stationary. Thus, to spread the product in the population there must be an initial shock of active consumers. This section analyzes a situation where the initial state of the dynamics is such that there is a \"small\" proportion of initial adopters, i.e.0 ? 0. One interpretation for this is that the firm interested in the diffusion of the product initially gives it \"for free\". It is reasonable to assume that the firm is going to choose a small number of initial adopters and then rely on the contagion process for the diffusion of it to a larger fraction of agents. Given the nature of the question, we will first focus on the concept of positive diffusion defined above. Unique and sustainable diffusion, will be studied later in the paper.  ). Specifically, in order to assess the existence or not of some positive prevalence, it is enough to consider what happens in a neighborhood with only one active agent. As highlighted above, this is merely a consequence of the fact that, for positive diffusion to occur, the state with no active consumers has to be unstable.

If, on the contrary, we assumep then, if there is only a small fraction of initial adopters, in the long-run, the product will disappear from the market.

In particular, it depends on the ratio between its first and second order moments.

The reason for this is the following: the variance of the connectivity distribution P (k) is given",

Then it is straightforward to show that their thresholds are ranked as follows:",

In scale-free networks there is a significant proportion of hubs, i.e., nodes with very high connectivity compared to the average. These nodes play a crucial role for the spreading of the product since they easily adopt the product due to their high connectivity. Furthermore, if they are active consumers, they are capable of influencing a significant fraction of individuals in the population."
