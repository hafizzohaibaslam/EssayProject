               "Under the different searches performed to analyzing social networks, much attention has been devoted to the problem of predicting links. It is a key technique in many applications such as recommendation systems which provide suggestions of potential links between nodes. Traditional link prediction methods use a single proximity metric. In this paper, we study link prediction as a supervised learning task where we try to combine multiple features as input data for classification. To improve the accuracy of prediction, we have been applying a select attributes algorithm. Experiments have been performed on two co-authorship data sets. Results demonstrate that Random Forest, k-nearest neighbors and Principal Component Analysis yield the best performances. a small diameter, which is also known as the small-world phenomenon or the six degrees of separation[4]. The density: of a graph measuring the extent to which it is a complete graph. The real networks often have a density very weak. We often observe that the number of links is proportional to the number of nodes. The Distribution degrees: of a node is known by the number of its direct neighbors. In real networks is often observed that there is some nodes that have very high degrees, and many others have very low degrees. Distribution of degrees is often described by a distribution power law [5]."
