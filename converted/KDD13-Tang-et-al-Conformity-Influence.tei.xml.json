               "Conformity is a type of social influence involving a change in opinion or behavior in order to fit in with a group. Employing several social networks as the source for our experimental data, we study how the effect of conformity plays a role in changing users' online behavior. We formally define several major types of conformity in individual, peer, and group levels. We propose Confluence model to formalize the effects of social conformity into a probabilistic model. Confluence can distinguish and quantify the effects of the different types of conformities. To scale up to large social networks , we propose a distributed learning method that can construct the Confluence model efficiently with near-linear speedup. Our experimental results on four different types of large social networks, i.e., Flickr, Gowalla, Weibo and Co-Author, verify the existence of the conformity phenomena. Leveraging the conformity information, Confluence can accurately predict actions of users. Our experiments show that Confluence significantly improves the prediction accuracy by up to 5-10% compared with several alternative methods."

               "Conformity was first studied by psychologists through interviews with small groups of participants . In economics, Bernheim found that sometimes people are willing to conform simply because they recognize that departure from the social norm may impair their status. Bernheim further proposed a theory of social conformity and presented a model to describe the conformity process. However, due to the lack of real data, he only studied the model from the theoretical aspect. With the rapid proliferation of online social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr, it becomes feasible and also very necessary to conduct an in-depth investigation of the conformity problem on real large social networks. In practice, the effect of conformity has been also observed in online social networks. For example, Bond et al. reported results from a randomized controlled trial of political mobilization messages delivered to 61 million Facebook users. They found that when one is aware that their friends have made the political votes, their likelihood to vote will significantly increase. Bakshy et al. also found that when their friends click an ad, they will be more likely to click the same ad.",

These studies can be roughly classified into three categories: influence testing , influence quantification , and influence maximization models . However, most of the works focus on qualitative study of social influence. With an exception, Tang et al. presented a Topical Affinity Propagation (TAP) approach to quantify the topic-level social influence in large networks. However, they do not distinguish the effect of peer influence and group conformity.",
               "There are several challenges for the conformity influence analysis. First, how to formally define and differentiate different types of conformities? Unlike peer influence, which mainly considers how two connected friends influence each other, conformity occurs in different situations and exists with different forms. Second, how to construct a computational model to learn the different conformity factors? Third, how to validate the proposed model in real large networks.",

Then we incrementally add one of the five social features and evaluate its improvement on the prediction performance over that using only basic features. shows the Area Under Curve (AUC) score on the different data sets. We see that different social factors contribute differently in the different networks. For example, the opinion leader based features are very useful in the Gowalla network, but less useful in the Co-Author network. On the other hand, the conformity based features consistently improve the prediction performance on all the networks. In terms of the AUC score, the improvements by adding conformity features range from 2% to 20% in the four networks. This analysis confirms the importance of the conformity phenomena in social networks. : Effect of conformity. Confluence base stands for the ConEffects of conformity. We further present an in-depth analysis of how different levels of conformities affect the performance of action prediction. shows the prediction performance (in terms of AUC) of the proposed Confluence by considering different levels of conformities. Confluence base stands for the Confluence method by considering only basic features (i.e., ignoring all conformity factors). It can be clearly seen that without the conformity based factors, the prediction performance drop significantly. Co-Author network is most predictable because the co-authorships are stable and predictable in general. Weibo and Flickr are the most difficult to predict because the user behavior is fairly autonomous and independent. Conformity has most significant prediction impact on Gowalla, which suggests conformity plays an important role in geospatial and mobile applications in social networks. By incorporating the conformity features, significant improvements (+20-30%) over the prediction performance can be ob- tained on Gowalla. Confluence base +I (or +P or +G) respectively indicates that we respectively add individual conformity features (or peer conformity features or group conformity features) into the Confluence base method. By incorporating each type of conformity factors, we observe clear improvement compared to the Confluence base method. We can also see that on all the four data sets, the group conformity is more important than the other two types of conformities. This makes sense, as in most cases conformity is a group phenomenon rather than an individual behavior."

Though the speedup inevitably decreases due to the increase of the communication cost between the different computer nodes, the distributed learning algorithm can still achieve ? 9speedup with 16 cores. It is noticeable that the speedup curves on different networks present a bit different patterns.

User A joined three groups (denoted as Group 1, 2, 3 respectively). On 03/10/2012, user A added one comment respectively to Picture 1 and Picture 2. The Action 1 (adding comment to Picture 1) was mainly performed in Group 1 and the Action 2 (adding comment to Picture 2) was mainly performed in Group 2. After modeling with the proposed Confluence method, the modeling results suggest that, for performing Action 1, user A has a strong conformity to user B, but very weak conformity to user D and C. By taking a closer look at the data, we found that Group 1 is a loosely connected group and members have very few connections in the group, and the comments to the same photo are very controversial (such as the comments of B and D to Picture 1). Thus the influence between users are mainly at the peer level. For AcConformity was first studied by psychologist through interviews with small groups of participants. Kelman identified three major types of conformity. However, the categorization is mainly from subject and cannot easily be detected by a computational model. In economics, Bernheim proposed the social conformity theory and presented a model for modeling the conformity process. However, due to the lack of real data, he mainly focused on the theoretical aspect of the model. Considerable work has been conducted for studying the effects of social influence. For example, Bakshy et al. conducted randomized controlled trials to identify the effect of social influence on consumer responses to advertising, and Bond et al. used a randomized controlled trial to verify the social influence on political voting behavior. Anagnostopoulos et al. proposed a shuffle test to examine the existence of social influence. However, most of the methods focus on qualitatively study the existence of social influence in different networks. Tang et al. presented a Topical Affinity Propagation (TAP) approach to quantify the topic-level social influence in large networks. Goyal et al. presented a method to learn the influence probabilities by counting the number of correlated social actions. Tan et a. proposed a model to learn and distinguish the effects of influence, correlation, and uses' action dependency. However, all the aforementioned works mainly consider the peer influence between users and ignore the group conformity effect. proposed the concept of social influence locality and used a large microblogging network to study how users' behavior is influenced by close friends in their ego networks. tried to study the interplay between influence and individual conformity. However, they do not consider the group conformity. Quite a few studies have been done for maximizing the influence spread in social network. Domingos and Richardson formally defined influence maximization as an algorithmic problem and prove its NP-hardness. Chen et al. further developed efficient algorithms to approximately solve the influence maximization problem. While, influence maximization is in nature different from the conformity analysis problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to formally define the problem of conformity influence analysis and to address this problem with a principled method."

It is also interesting to design some other model, for example a game theory based model, to model the conformity phenomenon. As for the proposed Confluence model itself, it has many parameters.
