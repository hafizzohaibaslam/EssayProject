               "As autonomous agents proliferate in the real world, both in software and robotic settings, they will increasingly need to band together for cooperative activities with previously unfamiliar teammates. In such ad hoc team settings, team strategies cannot be developed a priori. Rather, an agent must be prepared to cooperate with many types of teammates: it must collaborate without pre-coordination. This paper challenges the AI community to develop theory and to implement prototypes of ad hoc team agents. It defines the concept of ad hoc team agents, specifies an evaluation paradigm, and provides examples of possible theoretical and empirical approaches to challenge. The goal is to encourage progress towards this ambitious, newly realistic, and increasingly important research goal."

You see somebody fall off of his bicycle and injure himself badly; there are a few other people in the area, and all of you rush to help the victim. There are several things that need to be done. Somebody should call an ambulance, someone should check that the victim is still breathing, and someone should try to find a nearby doctor or policeman. However, none of you know one another, and thus you do not know who has a mobile phone, who is trained in first aid, who can run fast, and so forth. Furthermore, not all of you speak the same language. Nonetheless, it is essential that you quickly coordinate towards your common goal of maximizing the victim's chances of timely treatment and survival.",

Multiple agents (in this case humans) with different knowledge and capabilities find themselves in a situation such that their goals and utilities are perfectly aligned (effectively, everyone's sole interest is to help the victim), yet they have had no prior opportunity to coordinate. In addition to the emergency setting described above, ad hoc teams may arise among robots or software agents that have been programmed by different groups and/or at different times such that it was not known at development time that they would need to coordinate. For example, rescue robots may be brought to an earthquake site from different parts of the world, or an e-commerce agent may need to coordinate with other legacy agents that can no longer be altered. Note that in this latter example, the agents may need to coordinate repeatedly on the same or similar tasks.",

Similarly, a good team player must also be adept at assessing the other agents' knowledge states (does anybody know the right phone number?). Furthermore, it must be proficient at estimating the effects of its actions on the other agents.

Unlike most team settings considered so far (e.g., ), agents in ad hoc team settings are not all programmed by the same people, and may not all have the same communication protocols or world models. Furthermore, they are likely to have heterogeneous sensing and acting capabilities that may not be fully known to one another. As a result, team strategies cannot be developed a priori. Rather, an agent that is to succeed in such an ad hoc team setting must be prepared to adjust its behavior to interact as well as possible with many types of teammates: those with which it can communicate and those with which it cannot; those that are more mobile and those that are less mobile; those with better sensing capabilities and those with worse capabilities. A good team player's best actions are likely to differ significantly depending on the characteristics of its teammates.

If the teammate plays a fixed (possibly stochastic) strategy, the ad hoc team agent should simply learn what that strategy is and play the best response.

Specifically, the teammate can only execute a subset of the actions that the ad hoc team agent can execute, and, unlike the ad hoc team agent, it is unaware of the relative utilities of the various actions. It is also unaware that it is acting as a part of a team. They formalize this situation as an instance of the well-studied k-armed bandit problem .",
               "The basic setting of the k-armed bandit problem is as follows. At each time step, a learning agent selects one of the k arms to pull. The arm returns a payoff according to a fixed, but generally unknown, distribution. The agent's goal is to maximize the sum of the payoffs it receives over time. The setting is well-suited for studying exploration vs. exploitation: at any given time, the agent could greedily select the arm that has paid off the best so far, or it could select a different arm in order to gather more information about its distribution. Though k-armed bandits are often used for this purpose, the authors were the first to consider a multiagent cooperative setting in which the agents have different knowledge states and action capabilities.",

They initially consider a bandit with just three arms such that the teacher is able to select from any of the three arms, while the learner is only able to select from among the two arms with the lower expected payoffs. The authors consider the fully cooperative case such that the teacher's goal is to maximize the expected sum of the payoffs received by the two agents over time (the teacher is risk neutral). Specifically, the authors make the following assumptions:",

If there are any previously unseen arms, the learner selects one of them randomly (optimistic initialization). The teacher must then decide whether to do what is best in the short term, namely pull the arm with the highest expected payoff; or whether to increase the information available to its teammate, the learner, by pulling a different arm. Note that if the teacher were acting alone, trivially its optimal action would be to always pull the arm with highest expected payoff.",
               "By these assumptions, the learner is both less capable and less knowledgeable than the teacher, and it does not understand direct communication from the teacher. It is tempting to think that we should begin by improving the learner. But in the ad hoc team setting, that is not an option. The learner \"is what it is\" either because it is a legacy agent, or because it has been programmed by others. Our task is to determine the teacher's best actions given such learner behavior.",
               "This setting is only a limited representation of the full ad hoc team setting from Section 1. However it retains the most essential property, namely that a single agent in our control must interact with a teammate without the advance coordination. Nonetheless, even this initial scenario presents some interesting mathematical challenges. Specifically, Stone and Kraus prove several theoretical results pertaining to which arms the teacher should consider pulling, and under what conditions (including for the natural generalization with more than three arms). Furthermore, when the payoffs from the arms are discrete, they present a polynomial algorithm for the teacher to find the optimal arm to pull. .",
               "The study of collaborative k-armed bandits described in this section serves as a starting point for the theoretical analysis of ad hoc teams. However it leaves open many directions for extensions: situations in which the teacher does not have full knowledge, the learner is \"team aware,\" the number of iterations is not known, and/or the learner's behavior is not known a priori to the teacher, among others. We hope that this ad hoc teamwork challenge will inspire many new and challenging problems in the theoretical analysis of optimal control and optimal teamwork.",

In applications such as the annual RoboCup robot soccer competitions, entire teams of agents are designed in unison, enabling explicit pre-coordination via structures such as \"locker room agreements\" ).",
               "Other than the multi-armed bandit work previously described, the work that we are aware of that takes a perspective most similar to ad hoc teams is that of ) in which they consider a teacher agent and a learner agent repeatedly engaging in a joint activity. While the learner has no prior knowledge of this activity, the teacher understands its dynamics. However they mainly consider a situation in which teaching is not costly: the goal of their teacher is to maximize the number of times that the learner chooses the \"right\" action. Thus in some sense, the teacher is not \"embedded\" in the environment as a real teammate.",
               "Although the complete challenge put forth in this paper is very ambitious and likely to take many years to meet in a fully satisfactory way, there are numerous existing techniques that may be useful starting points for certain aspects of the challenge (e.g., for certain properties of A and D). The remainder of this section provides a small sampling of such existing techniques.",
               "? As mentioned in Section 3, game theory ) provides a useful theoretical foundation for multiagent interaction. Though originally intended as a model for human encounters (or those of human institutions), it has become much more broadly applied over the last several decades.",
               "? A good ad hoc team player may need to make an explicit assumption that its teammates are observing and reacting to its actions (that they are \"team aware\"). In doing so, the agent is actually planning its actions intending for them to be observed and interpreted. Intended plan recognition (in contrast to keyhole recognition) is the term used when the observed agent knows that it is being observed, and is acting under the constraints imposed by this knowledge . Much of the work on planning for intended recognition settings has focused on natural language dialogue systems ).",
               "? An important aspect of the ad hoc team challenge is recognizing, or \"modeling\" the capabilities of one's teammates. For this purpose, work from the opponent modeling literature (e.g., ) may be readily adaptable to similarly model teammates.",
               "In addition, a good ad hoc team agent must recognize the possibility that, while it is attempting to model its teammates, the teammates may be simultaneously modeling it. In such a case, the agent is engaged in a recursive modeling setting .",
               "? Claus and Boutilier show how reinforcement learning can provide a robust method for agents to learn how to coordinate their actions. This work is one of many approaches for cooperative multiagent learning (see surveys at ). In addition to existing AI methods, as mentioned in Section 1, previous work has examined the use of agents to support the formation of human ad hoc teams ). This work relies on an analysis of the sources of team variability, including member characteristics, team characteristics, and task characteristics ), which we borrow as a structure for classifying types of autonomous teammates in Section 5. In addition, software agents have been used to support the operation of human teams , and for distributed information gathering from distinct, otherwise independent information sources ( ). But we are not aware of any such work that enables an autonomous agent to itself act as an ad hoc teammate with previously unknown teammates."

Though today most agent teams are developed as a unit, we believe that it will not be long before autonomous agents, both in software and robotic settings, will very often need to band together on the fly (possibly with humans on their teams as well!). We hope that this challenge will encourage the research necessary to ensure that agents will be able to do so effectively when that time arrives."
