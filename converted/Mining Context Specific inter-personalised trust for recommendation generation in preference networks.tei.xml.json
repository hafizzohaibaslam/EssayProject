The proposed approach combines the idea of traditional recommendation systems and identification of network structures to explore context specific inter-personalised trust relationships among users. From the experimental results, we claim that the proposed approach can provide more accurate recommendations to individuals in a preference network."

               "Recommendation systems are widely implemented in many application domains . Technologies that have been popularly applied to recommendation systems include the user-based approach, the item-based approach and the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (KNN) . Firstly, user-based collaborative filtering predicts an active user's evaluation criteria for a particular item based on rating records from users with similar profiles. Similarly, item-based recommendation algorithms use the similarity between items instead of users. Thirdly, correlation and similarity between items or users are utilised to as measurement of proximity to form a neighborhood scheme. However, these approaches only assume single and homogeneous trust relationships between users or similarity, and evaluate item similarity from a simplistic world view.",
               "Communities reflect topological relationships between elements of the underlying system and represent functional entities . However, most of existing researches do not take the available feedback rating in the system into consideration to improve the community detection process. Actually, feedback ratings, which are one kind of user-generated content, are critical for perceiving item opinions according to users' preferences through sentiment analysis and opinion mining . Therefore, in the proposed approach in this paper, we take feedback ratings into account which can provide better supervision to the community detection process in the preference networks by providing rich context information."
