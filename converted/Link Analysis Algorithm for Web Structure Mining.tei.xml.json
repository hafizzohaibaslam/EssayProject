The primary goal of the web site owner is to provide the relevant information to the users to fulfill their needs. Web mining technique is used to categorize users and pages by analyzing users behavior, the content of pages and order of URLs accessed. Web Structure Mining plays an important role in this approach. In this paper gives an introduction to Web mining, then describes Web Structure mining in detail, and explores the data structure used by the Web. This paper also explores different algorithms and compares those algorithms used for Information Retrieval."

Retrieving of the required web page on the web, efficiently and effectively, is becoming a Challenge. Whenever a user wants to search the relevant pages, he/she prefers those relevant pages to be at hand. The bulk amount of information becomes very difficult for the users to find, extract, filter or evaluate the relevant information. This issue raises the necessity of some technique that can solve these challenges. Web mining can be easily executed with the help of other areas like Database (DB), Information retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning etc. The following challenges in Web Mining are:"

               "The complete process of extracting knowledge from Web data is follows in The World Wide Web has grown in the past few years from a small research community to the biggest and most popular way of communication and information dissemination. Every day, the WWW grows by roughly a million electronic pages, adding to the hundreds of millions already on-line. WWW serves as a platform for exchanging various kinds of information, ranging from research papers, and educational content, to multimedia content and software. The continuous growth in the size and the use of the WWW imposes new methods for processing these huge amounts of data. Moreover, the content is published in various diverse formats. Due to this fact, users are feeling sometimes disoriented, lost in that information overload that continues to expand. Web mining is a very broad research area emerging to solve the issues that arise due to the WWW phenomenon. The challenge for Web structure mining is to deal with the structure of the hyperlinks within the Web itself. Link analysis is an old area of research. However, with the growing interest in Web mining, the research of structure analysis had increased and these efforts had resulted in a newly emerging research area called Link Mining , which is located at the intersection of the work in link analysis, hypertext and web mining, relational learning and inductive logic programming, and graph mining. There is a potentially wide range of application areas for this new area of research, including Internet. The Web contains a variety of objects with almost no unifying structure, with differences in the authoring style and content much greater than in traditional collections of text documents. The objects in the WWW are web pages, and links are in-, out-and cocitation (two pages that are both linked to by the same page). Attributes include HTML tags, word appearances and anchor texts . This diversity of objects creates new problems and challenges, since is not possible to directly made use of existing techniques such as from database management or information retrieval. Link mining had produced some agitation on some of the traditional data mining tasks. Some of the following possible tasks of link mining applicable in Web structure mining. 1.Link-based Classification. Link-based classification is the most recent upgrade of a classic data mining task to linked domains . The task is to focus on the prediction of the category of a web page, based on words that occur on the page, links between pages, anchor text, html tags and other possible attributes found on the web page. 2.Link-based Cluster Analysis. The goal in cluster analysis is to find naturally occurring sub-classes. The data is segmented into groups, where similar objects are grouped together, and dissimilar objects are grouped into different groups. Different than the previous task, linkbased cluster analysis is unsupervised and can be used to discover hidden patterns from data. 3.Link Type. There are a wide range of tasks concerning the prediction of the existence of links, such as Predicting the type of link between two entities, or predicting the purpose of a link. 4.Link Strength. Links could be associated with weights. 5.Link Cardinality. The main task here is to predict the number of links between objects. There are many ways to use the link structure of the Web to create notions of authority. The main goal in developing applications for link mining is to made good use of the understanding of these intrinsic social organization of the Web.",
               "overlaps substantially with other areas, including data mining, text mining, information retrieval, and Web retrieval. The classification is based on two aspects: the purpose and the data sources. Retrieval research focuses on retrieving relevant, existing data or documents from a large database or document repository, while mining research focuses on discovering new information or knowledge in the data. On the basis of this, Web mining can be classified into web structure mining, web content mining, and web usage mining as shown in "

It is related to data mining because many data mining techniques can be applied in Web content mining. It is related to text mining because much of the web contents are texts. However, it is also quite different from data mining because Web data are mainly semistructured and/or unstructured, while data mining deals primarily with structured data. Web content mining is also different from text mining because of the semi-structure nature of the Web, while text mining focuses on unstructured texts. Web content mining thus requires creative applications of data mining and/or text mining techniques and also its own unique approaches. The technologies that are normally used in web content mining are NLP (Natural language processing) and IR (Information retrieval)."

We can view the web as a directed labeled graph whose nodes are the documents or pages and edges are the hyperlinks between them .This directed graph structure is known as web graph. There are number of algorithms proposed based on link analysis. Four important algorithms PageRank, Weighted PageRank and HITS are discussed below: V(A)PageRank This algorithm was developed by Brin and Page at Stanford University which extends the idea of citation analysis . In citation analysis the incoming links are treated as citations but this technique could not provide fruitful results because this gives some approximation of importance of page. So PageRank provides a better approach that can compute the importance of web page by simply counting the number of pages that are linking to it. These links are called as backlinks.If a backlink comes from an important page than this link is given higher weightage than those which are coming from nonimportant pages. The link from one page to another is considered as a vote. Not only the number of votes that a page receives is important but the importance of pages that casts the vote is also important. "
