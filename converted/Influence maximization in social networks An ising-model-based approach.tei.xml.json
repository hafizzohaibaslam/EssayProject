               "The past few years have seen increasing interest in understanding social networks as a medium for community interaction. A major challenge has been to understand various fundamental properties of social networks that form the basis for the formation and propagation of opinions across such networks. The main hurdle has been the absence of plausible models that specify the correlations between different members of a social network, which could then be used for algorithm design. This paper studies an influence maximization problem using an Ising-model-based approach. We first validate the credibility of the ferromagnetic Ising model in predicting opinion formation in social networks using cosponsorship data from the US Senate proceedings. We then develop a greedy placement algorithm that can efficiently find an appropriate subset of network members, \"bribing\" whom can efficiently propagate a particular opinion in the network. We use simulations to confirm the effectiveness of the greedy placement algorithm."

               "The rapid and global emergence of online social networks over the past few years, and their meteoric adoption by millions of Internet users has seen renewed interest in the study of the properties of social networks as a whole. Indeed, one can envision a future society in which communication, reputation, marketing and the very molding of societal opinions transpire on online social networking platforms. A major challenge has been to understand the properties of social networks that might allow for the harnessing of this new medium to attain desirable outcomes. A basic question is related to the propagation of influence in a social network, i.e., how does a person's opinion change the opinions of other people in the network? Also, if there are two possible views on a particular issue, which is the dominant one? This is a problem with important practical applications, especially for firms or organizations who want to promote their products or philosophies. The solution could help such firms or organizations decide the most effective places to advertise their products/philosophies.",
               "In this paper, we consider an influence maximization problem. Specifically, suppose there is a particular issue about which members of a social network could have two possible opinions, and assume that we can \"bribe\" a fixed number of members, the question is whom should we bribe to cause the dominance of the opinion of our choice? Problems relating to such influence maximization were first formulated in , and have been studied in - . These results, however, are established based on the independent cascade model wherein a member is activated (convinced by the opinion) with a probability depending on the state of her/his neighbors. Further, the models usually assume that the members either have a particular opinion or are neutral, but not that they might be trying to propagate opposite opinions.",
               "In this paper, we consider a social network and assume there are two competing opinions on a specific subject. We define the value of a member's opinion to be \"+1\" if the member is in favor of the subject and \"-1\" if the member is against that subject. In order to represent the correlation of opinions between friends and acquaintances, we adopt the ferromagnetic Ising model , which was first proposed in statistical physics. In particular, we adopt the concept that the ground state (the configuration that emerges when the temperature goes to zero) of the network is the most likely opinion formed because the ground state minimizes the magnitude of conflicts in the social network (in physical systems, the ground state is the state with minimum energy). This model was shown to be effective in identifying community structure in social networks . Note that the Ising-based model differs from the independent cascade model in two aspects: (i) the Ising-modelbased approach allows both positive and negative influences so can be used to model two completing opinions while the independent cascade model (except the one in ) only allows one opinion in the network; and (ii) the \"concept\" of ground state models the \"self-optimizing\" nature of the social network. In other words, the network tries to minimize the degree of conflict and settles down in the minimum conflict state, which does not exist in the independent cascade model.",
               "We develop an Ising-model-based approach wherein linkweights between nodes model their degree of correlation. We assume that subsets of nodes are irretrievably fixed with a positive or negative opinion, while others' opinions are caused due to the propagation of influence of these seed nodes. In order to validate this model we use data from the records of bill cosponsorship in the US Senate, wherein we fix link weights between senators (nodes) based on the number of bills that they cosponsored . We fix some nodes as known to be \"Democrat\" or \"Republican\", and show that ground state of the system automatically and correctly identifies the party affiliations of the remaining nodes. We then attempt to answer the general question of how to identify the most appropriate nodes to \"bribe\" in order to cause a particular opinion to dominate. Thus, we are given a budget of nodes whose opinions we can fix, and must decide which nodes should be chosen. We develop a greedy algorithm to choose nodes, and show that it outperforms an algorithm that makes choices solely based on the degree of nodes.",
               "The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the Ising model based on a Markovian random field, and then describe the connection between the ground state of the Ising model and the min-cut of the corresponding graph. This connection allows us to compute the ground state in an efficient way. We then validate the Ising model and the ground state concept on a Senate network in Section III. We propose a greedy placement algorithm in Section IV that finds m positive seeds that can maximize the number of positive nodes at the ground state. We then present simulation results in Section V to compare the performance of the greedy algorithm with a degree-based placement algorithm. We conclude in Section VI.",

Specifically, we can sort all free nodes (nodes that are not seeds) in decreasing order of their degrees, and choose the first m nodes as extra positive seeds. We call this approach the Degree-based Placement Algorithm.
