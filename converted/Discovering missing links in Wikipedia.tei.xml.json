               "In this paper, we describe our work on discovering missing links in Wikipedia articles. This task is important for both readers and authors of Wikipedia. The readers will benefit from the increased article quality with better navigation support. On the other hand, the system can be employed to support the authors during editing. This study combines the strengths of different approaches previously applied for the task, and adds its own techniques to reach satisfactory results. Because of the subjectivity in the nature of the task; automatic evaluation is hard to apply. Comparing approaches seems to be the best method to evaluate new techniques, and we offer a semi-automatized method for evaluation of the results. The recall is calculated automatically using existing links in Wikipedia. The precision is calculated according to manual evaluations of human assessors. Comparative results for different techniques are presented, showing the success of our improvements. We employ Turkish Wikipedia, we are the first to study on it, to examine whether a small instance is scalable enough for such purposes."

It improves the traditional encyclopedia concept with abilities of information technologies and provides practical features like linking, categorizing, inserting info-boxes etc. for enabling users to access knowledge faster. These features also exhibits machine processable hypertext structures which are rich semantic resources forming a relevancy based network between articles. These features also offer low processing cost than would be the case for processing whole textual content. As a result, Wikipedia increasingly attracts the attention of various kinds of research areas.",

The main source of this reliability is the auto-control system depending on the large number of authors collaboratively creating and checking the content. There are guidelines instructing authors about the principles of high quality content. Moreover, social mechanisms across the authors like assigned responsibilities for quality assurance are established.",
               "Although obtrusive errors like vandalism and absence of references can be usually detected by these mechanisms, small mistakes that are encountered more are often overlooked. Missing links in articles are example of such mistakes. Another problem is the large amount of articles that are relatively new and have not reached a mature state with respect to the size and quality of content. Since the authors usually do not add all links while entering or updating the content, some articles with missing links remain for a long time since an author has not revisited them. For example, textual part of the article \"Kaynak Tan?mlama C ? er?evesi\" (eng: Resource Description Framework -RDF) in Turkish Wikipedia is relatively long with about 1500 words. But it contains only a single link by January 2010, although it was created in March 2007. As a result, automatic discovery of missing links is important to improve the quality of articles and to help authors during editing.",

Also, links should increase the understandability by providing necessary navigation support. Technical terms, names of people and places should be selected as links instead of ordinary words in the language unless they are important for the context. On the other hand, irrelevant or insignificant links decrease the readability of the article. Additionally, again for readability purposes, if a concept is linked once in the article, it should not be linked again unless necessary.",

Two general, unsupervised approaches are taken as the solutions to this problem. First approach is trying to match the terms in the text to an article title in Wikipedia, and then filtering out unsuitable ones . The second approach is selecting links from a set of relevant existing links, as in Adafre and de study. We combine the strong features of these approaches and our improvements to reach the best results. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Also, we observed that Turkish Wikipedia contains many links to date articles that contain lists of events that occurred on a named date. They do not contain any topic and should not be linked.

Additionally, since our system aims missing link discovery, it exploits from the existing links in the articles. Therefore, it would not be feasible to evaluate by removing existing links.

Extracting all of them is not realizable and might heavily vary between people. As a result, we preferred a different method which indirectly measures the recall. First, a single randomly selected link is removed from an article. Then, link discovery is applied to this article, and discovery of the removed link is expected. Totally, for 2000 random articles, 2000 different link discoveries are identified as expected discoveries. Consequently, the ratio of articles meeting this expectation is accepted as recall value.",

This can be interpreted as a clue to expose the fact that category relationship might be a more important semantic information that reveals the relatedness of articles compared to the link relationship.",
               "Another interesting result is the parallelness of the behaviour of second and third approaches. These two techniques exploit, consecutively, the outgoing links and the incoming links of the target article. The similarity of results might indicate incoming and outgoing link sets of articles highly intersect. Therefore, it may point to the article clusters in Wikipedia article space, which are classified by the density of interconnections by means of links.",
               "The results show that variety and number of articles considered increase the success. Therefore, as a most comprehensive alternative, we experimented with combining all these related article retrieval techniques and the system achieved the best results. gives a comparison of techniques applied in order to select related articles. The best achieving method of the previous section is used for this experiment. The results can be separated into two main groups which are obviously parallel to the characteristic features of the techniques. The first three techniques explore related articles with a direct link or category relationship. For this group, the results seem satisfactory in terms of precision but the recall of these techniques is very low. On the other hand, techniques in the second group apply an index search on whole articles based on the link overlap with the target article. For this group, while precision is preserved, the recall increases to the same level. The difference of recall for the two groups can be associated In this section, we will discuss the link gain obtained by discovery of missing links. The 2,000 articles used in the recall experiments initially contained a total of 34,508 links, which corresponds to 17.3 links per article. lists the discovery amounts for each method. The first column gives the number of total discoveries by method. The second one contains the normalized number of discoveries, obtained by multiplying the discoveries with the precision of the method, since the number of correct suggestions is more meaningful. The last column gives the increase ratio of normalised link numbers by applying the discovery. The results show that a considerable enrichment of the links might be gained by applying link discovery. The most remarkable finding from the results is the success of the methods with high recall values despite their low precision and thus the F-measure values. According to these results, the system might be employed as a suggestion system where the suggestion will be accepted or ignored by the user. This usage might allow omitting the precision loss of 15% and preferring high number of discov-  "

               "In this paper, we explained our work on missing link discovery task on Turkish Wikipedia, using a method which combines different approaches. We suggest a semi-automated approach for evaluation, where this was completely manual in previous studies. The comparison of results show that our improvements bring a considerable contribution to the field. To improve our system, better ways for implementing contextual linkness filtering can be explored. For example, the contextual information carried by the categories or infoboxes might be considered. Also, we have examined that first sentences of some articles do not provide satisfactory contextual information because of lack of necessary links. As a result, for such articles, the number of query results is less than five and the linkness filtering is performed. Therefore, a broader section like the first paragraphs might be preferred instead of the first sentences.",
               "Satisfactory results of our system prompt us to develop a suitable GUI application to serve Wikipedia users. This application might be thought of as a suggestion system for the reader and editor of an article. The user can see the suggestions both in the article text and as a list from which the user can manipulate the results to filter out unnecessary ones. Also statistics can be more easily collected about our suggestions to measure precision more precisely.",
               "Wikipedia allows the cross-lingual matching of articles which results to a rich multilingual resource. Exploiting the cross-lingual link structure of Wikipedia seems as to be a promising approach for various kind of multilingual tasks. It might also be benefited for our task by considering the existing links in other language versions of the articles.",
               "Another future study might aim at determination of the best location for inserting links when there are more than one occurrences of the same term. Wikipedia guidelines suggest linking as early as possible but also considering the local (e.g. sentence or paragraph scope) relevancy of the term. Therefore, the system should select the most leading location which is contextually suitable for inserting the link."
