POI recommendation is a task that facilitates users' urban exploration and helps them filter uninteresting POIs for decision making. While existing work of POI recommendation on location-based social networks (LBSNs) discovers the spatial, temporal, and social patterns of user check-in behavior, the use of content information has not been systematically studied. The various types of content information available on LBSNs could be related to different aspects of a user's check-in action, providing a unique opportunity for POI recommendation. In this work, we study the content information on LB-SNs w.r.t. POI properties, user interests, and sentiment indications. We model the three types of information under a unified POI recommendation framework with the consideration of their relationship to check-in actions.

In the meantime, how to efficiently make a satisfying decision among the large number of POIs becomes a tough problem for a user, usually referred to as \"choice paralysis\" .

While prior work of POI recommendation on LBSNs mostly focuses on investigating the spatial, temporal, and social layers in terms of spatial-temporal patterns ( ), social-spatial properties ( ; Gao, Tang, and Liu 2012), etc., the use of content information has not been systematically studied, thus missing the potential effect of content information in its recommendation efforts on LBSNs.",

This is an example of POI Properties. By observing a user's comment on a Mexican restaurant discussing its spicy food, we observe the User Interests in spicy food. If the comment is actually a compliment, e.g., \"Best spicy food ever!\", we could infer both the user's Sentiment Indications and her interests.

               "In this section, we discuss the recommendation efforts of different types of content information on LBSNs, i.e., Sentiment Indications (SI), User-Interest Content (UIC), and POI-Property Content (PPC). We propose to consider their different combinations by setting the corresponding parameter(for sentiment indications),1 (for user-interest content), and2 (for POI-property content). For each parameter, if the corresponding type of content is considered, we set it to the optimal value; otherwise, 0. Sincerelates to both UIC and PPC, we set it to the optimal value when both types of content information have been considered, and 0 if only one or none of them has been considered. lists the comparison results. We useto indicate that the corresponding content information is used, andotherwise.",
               "Sentiment information is helpful in improving the POI recommendation performance. It consistently improves the performance based on existing content information. However, its recommendation effect is not as great as userinterest content and POI-property content. One possible reason could be that sentiment information is quite noisy in user-generated content, while the non-perfect lexicon-based sentiment classification approach exacerbates the capturing of essential user attitude content.",
               "User-interest content presents more recommendation effect than the other two types of content information. One possible reason could be that user-interest content contains more information than POI-property content regarding a user's interests, which is more helpful to capture user preferences. The combination of all three types of content information, i.e., CAPRF, has the best performance among all the other methods. This indicates the complementary effect among the three types of content information. According to , these information constitutes the key factors of POI recommender systems.",

               "POI recommendation, also referred to as location recommendation, has been recognized as an essential task on recommender systems. It was firstly studied on GPS trajectory data ( . With the development of LBSNs, users are able to check-in at realworld POIs which generates abundant spatial, temporal, social, and content information. Due to the strong correlations between geographical distance and social connections discovered in previous work ( , current work on POI recommendation on LBSNs mainly focuses on leveraging the geographical and social properties to improve recommendation effectiveness. introduced POI recommendation into LBSNs and investigated the geographical influence ( ) and social influence (Ye, Liu, and Lee 2012) for POI recommendation. Cheng (Cheng In this work, we systematically study the content information on LBSNs for POI recommendation. We investigate various types of content information on LBSNs in terms of sentiment indications, user interests, and POI properties. We model them under a unified POI recommendation framework. Our experimental results demonstrate the significance of content information in explaining user behavior and improve POI recommendation performance on LBSNs. In the future, we will continue studying the content information, especially the effect of sentiment indications, such as user opinions, on different facets of a POI. Furthermore, it would be interesting to investigate the recommendation effect of content information compared to other information, such as spatial, temporal, or social information."
