               "In studying the dynamical behavior of processes in artificial or natural social systems, a key factor is the topology of the network structure. It has been shown that real-world social networks tend to have non-random network structure with properties such as short average path length, excess clustering , and skewed degree distributions (Albert & Barab��si 2002; Newman 2003). We show in this paper that the nature of the network structure in a social network of artificial or simulated agents has a significant effect on the performance of the overall system. We conclude that finding \"good\" network structures for a particular application domain is critical to modeling artificial social systems and implementing multi-agent systems. We argue that techniques for adapting network structure will be critical in large-scale agent communities."

These networks have connected people, organizations, and companies in ways that have drastically affected international culture and the global economy. Several discoveries have been made about the underlying structure of the Internet and the World-Wide Web, including \"diameter\" approximations. Scientists have also proposed general principles, including \"preferential attachment,\" for growing such networks .",
               "Similarly, the underlying structure of social networks has been of interest to researchers for many years, starting with the work of Stanley . Milgram was interested in investigating the lengths of paths between people in large social networks. Although his experiments were not comprehensive, his hypothesis that social networks have small diameter has been validated. In fact, many social networks have since been investigated and are found to support Milgram's low-diameter hypothesis, including scientific collaboration networks ) and telephone call graphs .",

Three of the most prominently observed properties of real-world graphs are short average path lengths, excess clustering, and skewed degree distributions . Commonly referred to as the \"small-world effect,\" short average path length was first recognized by analyzing the number of hops it took for postal mail to get to a specific destination if sent out randomly at first . Average path length is measured by calculating the average distance between any two nodes in the network .",
               "Excess clustering is found in networks that have more clustering than would be expected in a random graph of the same size. The amount of clustering in a graph is defined as the number of three-cliques, or triangles, that exist in the graph normalized by the number of possible triangles (i.e., the number of connected triples of nodes) ).",
               "The degree distribution of a network is the frequency of occurrence of nodes with each degree (i.e., number of connections). Although there are many possible distributions for degree, it has been observed that most real-world networks have a highly skewed degree distribution. These distribution have \"heavy tails,\" and in general follow a power law, that is P (k)k ?, which implies that the network has a hub and spoke structure, with some nodes having very large degree .",

In this interaction topology, agents have a geometric locality and are limited to directly interacting with agents that are located within a close proximity. The two-dimensional lattice does not exhibit short average path lengths or a skewed degree distribution, but does exhibit a form of generalized clustering, called transitivity. Transitivity is measured by considering the number of shared neighbors among nodes (Newman 2003). As will be seen below, lattice networks are the foundation of small-world networks.",

All three of the networks are constructed from a one-dimensional lattice where nodes are connected to four other nodes based on physical proximity.",
               "Random Graphs. Random graphs were first introduced in the 1960s by . A random graph G N,p consists of N nodes that are connected randomly, with p denoting the probability of an edge existing between a randomly chosen pair of vertices. Random graph models have been widely studied and are quite useful since many of their properties can be computed analytically. For instance, the average number of undirected edges in G N,p is N (N ? 1)p/2, and the average degree of a vertex is k = p(N ? 1)pN , where the approximate solution holds for large N . Recent evidence suggests that random graphs are not representative of real-world networks . They do possess short average path lengths, but random graphs do not exhibit large amounts of clustering or a skewed degree distribution. Random graphs are included in this study, because they have been widely used for decades. We will compare the dynamics that arise from random graphs to those arising from alternative graph models that are structured more like real-world networks. come disconnected.

A key observation is that small-world networks have properties that lie between those of regular (lattice) networks and random graphs. Lattices are the starting place for small-world networks. Lattice models lend themselves directly to increased clustering because they imply physical localities among agents. A simple example of this is a ring of nodes (i.e., a onedimensional lattice wrapped upon itself) where each node connects to the closest nodes on either side. The key feature here is that for any neighborhood, most of the nodes are connected to one another inducing clustering.",

The parameteris used to determine if an edge is replaced by a random shortcut through the graph. One caveat in this construction of a small-world graph is that the graph can bewhere i is a new node being added to the network and P (e ij ) is the probability of the creation of an edge from i to j. Here, k v is the degree of node v. There must be an initial connected core of m 0 nodes, ensuring that at the beginning of the graph generation process, nodes with non-zero degree exist. There are several additional parameters for the model including the number of expected initial connections that a node will make m and a scaling factor for the probability of connectionto force the graphs to be more or less dense. Note that when m == 1, the probabilities of connecting to existing nodes in the network sum to exactly one. Scale-free graphs exhibit both short average path lengths and a skewed degree distribution but, like random graphs, lack excess clustering )."

One of the factors contributing to the somewhat poor performance of the small-world model may be its ties to geographic space. The result show that the scale-free graph structure supports rapid diffusion of innovation in a large organization of agents with sub-optimal information processing capabilities.

Not unlike innovation diffusion, opinion formation models address the question of how opinions (usually binary, but sometimes continuous) can spread and change through an agent organization. There are many different factors that affect organizational opinion formation. One factor is that of social impact based on a notion of capturing two agents' social distance: the distance between the two agents' beliefs and ideals .",

Each agent, i, possesses a strength, s i > 0, an opinion,i{?1, 1}, and a position in some defined space. In the original model, the position of each agent was fixed in a two-dimensional grid . In this situation, agent i's social distance from agent j is simply the Euclidean distance between their respective locations. Also included in the model is a notion of an external influence, h, which can be thought of as information external to the organizations that the agents can observe. Similarly, social noise,, is included in the model and serves as a mechanism for including uncertainty, trust, and reputation in the dynamics of the model. Social impact is the impact of the entire organization on an agent's opinion formation process . To calculate social impact, the partial impact for agent i is first calculated by their opinion). Leaders must be strong to convince an entire organization to change its opinion. The underlying structure of the organization impacts the necessary strength of the leader.",

The agents are given random initial opinions. After 10 simulation time steps, the designated leader switches and fixes its opinion. Once 90% of the agents in the organization change to the leader's opinion, the time is recorded. If 90% of the organization does not change opinion after 100 time steps, it is determined that the leader is not strong enough to change the opinion of the entire organization. In all simulations the leader is the most highly connected agent (i.e., the agent with the smallest average distance to all other agents). Based on the original studies , the number of agents is 625; social noise= 167.3; external influence h = ?0.5; and each data point is the average of ten simulations. This function is a squashing function to create non-linear effects on changing opinions. The agent updates its opinion based on this probability where leader strength : Time to shift the entire network's opinion, as a function of leader strength, for scale-free networks (solid red) and random graphs (dashed green).",

The agents in the original model are in fact fully connected; every agent impacts every other agent's opinion. To explore the effects of network structure on opinion formation, we replace the use of the Euclidean distance metric with that of geodesic (shortest path) distance measured from the agent social network structure. The results presented below are provided in the context of a specified leader attempting to change the opinion of the entire organization.",
