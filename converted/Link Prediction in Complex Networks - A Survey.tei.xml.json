               "Link prediction in complex networks has attracted increasing attention from both physical and computer science communities. The algorithms can be used to extract missing information, identify spurious interactions, evaluate network evolving mechanisms, and so on. This article summaries recent progress about link prediction algorithms, emphasizing on the contributions from physical perspectives and approaches, such as the random-walk-based methods and the maximum likelihood methods. We also introduce three typical applications: reconstruction of networks, evaluation of network evolving mechanism and classification of partially labelled networks. Finally, we introduce some applications and outline future challenges of link prediction algorithms."

Denote by U the universal set containing all |V |(|V |?1) 2 possible links, where |V | denotes the number of elements in set V . Then, the set of nonexistent links is U ? E. We assume there are some missing links (or the links that will appear in the future) in the set U ? E, and the task of link prediction is to find out these links.",
               "Generally, we do not know which links are the missing or future links, otherwise we do not need to do prediction. Therefore, to test the algorithm's accuracy, the observed links, E, is randomly divided into two parts: the training set, E T , is treated as known information, while the probe set (i.e., validation subset), E P , is used for testing and no information in this set is allowed to be used for prediction. Clearly, E TE P = E and E TE P = ?. The advantage of this random sub-sampling validation is that the proportion of the training split is not dependent on the number of iterations. But with this method some links may never be selected in the probe set, whereas others may be selected more than once, resulting in statistical bias. This limitation can be overcame by using the K-fold cross-validation, in which the observed links is randomly partitioned into K subsets. Each time one subset is selected as probe set, the rest K ? 1 constitute the training set. The cross-validation process is then repeated K times, with each of the K subsets used exactly once as the probe set. With this method, all links are used for both training and validation, and each link is used for prediction exactly once. Clearly, a larger K will lead to smaller statistical bias yet require more computation. Some experimental evidences suggested that the 10-fold cross-validation is a very good tradeoff between cost and performance . An extreme case called leave-one-out method (i.e., the |V |-flod cross-validation) will be applied in Section 6.2.",
               "Two standard metrics are used to quantify the accuracy of prediction algorithms: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Precision . In principle, a link prediction algorithm provides an ordered list of all non-observed links (i.e., U ? E T ) or equivalently gives each non-observed link, say (x, y)U ? E T , a score s xy to quantify its existence likelihood. The AUC evaluates the algorithm's performance according to the whole list while the Precision only focuses on the L links with the top ranks or the highest scores. A detailed introduction of these two metrics is as follows.",
               "(i) AUC.-Provided the rank of all non-observed links, the AUC value can be interpreted as the probability that a randomly chosen missing link (i.e., a link in E P ) is given a higher score than a randomly chosen nonexistent link (i.e., a link in U ? E). In the algorithmic implementation, we usually calculate the score of each non-observed link instead of giving the ordered list since the latter task is more time-consuming. Then, at each time we randomly pick a missing link and a nonexistent link to compare their scores, if among n independent comparisons, there are ntimes the missing link having a higher score and ntimes they have the same score, the AUC value is",
               "If all the scores are generated from an independent and identical distribution, the AUC value should be about 0.5. Therefore, the degree to which the value exceeds 0.5 indicates how much better the algorithm performs than pure chance.",
               "(ii) Precision.-Given the ranking of the non-observed links, the Precision is defined as the ratio of relevant items selected to the number of items selected. That is to say, if we take the top-L links as the predicted ones, among which L r links are right (i.e., there are L r links in the probe set E P ), then the Precision equals L r /L. Clearly, higher precision means higher prediction accuracy.  shows an example of how to calculate the AUC and Precision. In this simple graph, there are five nodes, seven existent links and three nonexistent links ((1, 2), (1, 4) and ). To test the algorithm's accuracy, we need to select some existent links as probe links. For instance, we pick (1, 3) and (4, 5) as probe links, which are presented by dash lines in the right plot. Then, any algorithm can only make use of the information contained in the training graph (presented by solid lines in the right plot . Clearly, the former is wrong while the latter is right, and thus the Precision equals 0.5."

All non-observed links are ranked according to their scores, and the links connecting more similar nodes are supposed to be of higher existence likelihoods. In despite of its simplicity, the study on similarity-based algorithms is the mainstream issue. In fact, the definition of node similarity is a nontrivial challenge.

The structural similarity indices can be classified in various ways, such as local vs. global, parameter-free vs. parameter-dependent, node-dependent vs. path-dependent, and so on. The similarity indices can also be sophisticatedly classified as structural equivalence and regular equivalence.

Notice that, PA performs even worst than pure chance for the Internet at router level and the power grid. In these two networks, the nodes have well-defined positions and the links are physi-cal lines. Actually, geography plays a significant role and links with very long geographical distances are rare. As local centers, the high-degree nodes have longer geographical distances to each other than average, and thus have a lower probability of directly connecting to each other, which leads to the bad performance of PA. In contrast, although USAir has well-defined geographical positions of nodes, its links are not physical. Empirical data has demonstrated that the number of airline flights is not very sensitive to the geographical distance within a big range (another topological evidence for the relatively good performance of PA on USAir is the so-called rich-club phenomenon ).

The hierarchical structure model provides a smart way to predict missing links, and, maybe more significantly, it uncovers the hidden hierarchical organization of networks. However, as mentioned above, a big disadvantage is that this algorithm runs very slow. Actually, the process to sample dendrograms usually asks for O(N 2 ) steps of the Markov chain , and in the worst case, it takes exponential time . In comparison, according to the CPU of an advanced desktop computer, the hierarchical structure model cannot manage a network of tens of thousands nodes, while the algorithms based on local similarity indices can deal with networks with tens of millions nodes.

In practice, Guimerand Sales-Pardo designed a simple greedy algorithm. Their algorithm starts by evaluating the link reliabilities for all pairs of nodes. Then, at each time step it removes the link with the lowest reliability and adds the link (not yet in the current network) with the highest reliability. This change is accepted if and only if the network reliability increases. If it is rejected, the link with the next lowest reliability and the notyet-existent link with the next highest reliability will be the next candidate for swapping. The algorithm stops if it rejects five consecutive attempts to swap links. The observed network is set as the initialization of the algorithm, and it will consecutively become another network with higher reliability than the initial network. Guimerand Sales-Pardo tested their algorithm by generating hypothetical observed networks A O from the true networks A T (the five true networks used for testing are introduced in Section 4.2). Each observation has a fraction of the true links removed and an identical number of random links added.",

Notice that, the results from the greedy algorithm may be far different from the real optimum subject to the maximal reliability, thus we may expect even better estimates if one has developed a more effective and/or efficient algorithm. Readers should be warned that in both the algorithm and the preparation of observed networks, a latent assumption is that the number of missing links and the number of spurious links are equal. Since in the real systems, these two numbers may be very different (it is easy to image that in many networks, such as metabolic networks and friendship networks, the missing links are much more than the spurious links), the effectiveness of the algorithm still needs further validation."

Hence we can not easily know which factor(s) leads to the scale-free property of a real network, and in fact there can be so many models competing for the final explanation of a given real network. It is very hard to evaluate different models by comparing their resulted networks with the target network, since there are too many metrics for topological features . As mentioned in Section 1, there are many models about the topology of the Internet, some more accurately reproduce the degree distribution and the disassortative mixing pattern (e.g., see Ref. ) and some better characterize the k-core structure (e.g., see Ref. ).

We hope this methodology could provide a fair platform to compare different evolving models, which may be significant for the studies of network modeling.

In addition, Cui et al. developed an evolving model driven completely by the common neighborhood, which well reproduces not only the global network properties, but also the local structural features like power-law clique-degree distributions of social and technological networks. Therefore, we simply use the common neighbor index S CN (see Eq. 2) to represent the topological ingredient. Geographical distance is considered to be one of the realistic factors that affect the existence of nodes' interactions in networks .

Two main difficulties in achieving highly accurate classification are the sparsity of the known labeled nodes and the inconsistency of label information. To address these two difficulties, a simple but effective method is to add artificial connections between every pair of labeled and unlabeled nodes according to their similarity scores , with almost the same techniques used in similarity-based link prediction. An underlying assumption is that two nodes are more likely to be categorized into the same class if they are more similar to each other.",

               "In this article, we briefly summarized the progress of studies on link prediction, emphasizing on the recent contributions by statistical physicists. Although link prediction is not a new problem in information science, traditional methods have not caught up the new development of network science, especially the new perspectives and tools resulted from the studies of complex networks. In our opinion, the studies of link prediction and complex networks will benefit each other, because the in-depth understanding of network structure can be used to design advanced link prediction algorithms (e.g., making use of the information about hierarchical organization and modular structure of real networks to better predict missing links) and the performance of a link prediction algorithm could give evidences about structural features as well as the algorithms themselves can be used to improve the estimates of real networks' properties and to evaluate the evolving network models. In a word, to statistical physicists, the study of link prediction is just unfolding.",
               "Up to now, the studies of link prediction overwhelmingly emphasize on the unweighted undirected networks. For directed networks, even the ternary relations are complicated, and thus the simple common-neighbor-based similarity indices have to be modified to take into account the local motif structure . Otherwise even we can predict the existence of an arc between two nodes, we can not determine its direction. In addition, the path-dependent similarity indices should also be extended to take into account the link direction . The fundamental task of link prediction in weighted networks, namely to predict the existence of links with the help of not only the observed links but also their weights, has already been considered by and . The former suggested that the links with higher weights are more important in predicting missing links, while the latter indicated a completely opposite conclusion: the weak links play a more significant role. How to properly exploit the information of weights to improve the prediction accuracy is still an unsolved problem. A harder problem is to predict the weights of links, which is relevant to the traffic prediction for urban transportation and air transportation systems . We are expecting some variants of link prediction algorithms can also contribute to this domain.",
               "A big challenge is the link prediction in multi-dimensional networks, where links could have different meanings. For example, a social network may consist of positive and negative links, respectively pointing to friends and foes , or trusted and distrusted peers . proposed a method to predict the signs of links (positive or negative), yet the prediction of both the existence of a link and its sign has not been well studied. Recent development of social balance theory may provide useful hints .",
               "A more complicated kind of multi-dimensional networks is the ones consisted of several classes of nodes. For example, an online resource-sharing system, such as Del.icio.us 15 , can be represented by a network that consists of three kinds of nodes: users, URLs and tags. Different from the tripartite networks, nodes in the same class can also be connected, like an arc can be added from a user to her/his follower who has imposed her/his collections. Ignoring the connections within a class of nodes, the prediction of links between users and objects has already been investigated . However, there is still nothing reported about the link prediction algorithms taking into account both the links within a class and the links between classes.",
               "Inspired by the success in recommender systems, we think the prediction accuracy can be considerably improved by hybrid algorithms . Given a specific target network, we can implement many individual prediction algorithms, and then try to select and organize them in a property way. This so-called ensemble learning method can obtain better prediction performance than could be obtained from any of the individual algorithms . Although the scientific significance of such a method is not clear to us, building ensemble systems for link prediction could be of huge practical value.",
               "The algorithms' performance can be effectively enhanced by considering some external information, like the attributes of nodes . In common sense, two people share more tastes and interests (and thus may of higher probability to be connected in a social network) if they have more common features, such as age, sex, job, and so on. The attribute information can be used to predict links without considering the network structures. Thus, when the existed links themselves are unreliable, attribute-based methods are preferable, which can to some extent solve the so-called cold start problem -a big challenge of link prediction . Besides, community structures can also help improving prediction accuracy . In social networks, since one person may play different roles in different communities, the prediction in one domain can be inspired by the information in others . For example, when we predict the collaborations between authors, we can consider their affiliations to improve the accuracy.",
               "Most of current approaches take into account a single snapshot of a network to predict the missing or future links. Extensive experiments show that these methods well uncover whether a link exists. However, this static graph representation is difficult in predicting the repeated link occurrences. For example, it is impossible to predict whether and when two authors will collaborate again in co-authorship network. Addressing this problem, Huang and Lin proposed a time-series link prediction approach considering the temporal evo-lutions of link occurrences, which is more appropriate for dealing with the link prediction problem in evolving networks, such as online social networks. Another way to involve time information is inspired by the fact that older events are less likely to be relevant to future links than recent ones. For example, author's interests may change over time and thus old publications might be less relevant to his currents research area. developed a graph-based link prediction method that incorporate the temporal information contained in evolving networks. They found that the performance can be improved by either time-based weighting of edges (i.e., giving the older events smaller weights or even neglecting them) or weighting of edges according to the connecting strength. However, to design effective algorithms and eventually settle this problem, we need in-depth and comprehensive understanding of temporal effects on human's interests, attentions and so on, which asks for extensive empirical analyses."
