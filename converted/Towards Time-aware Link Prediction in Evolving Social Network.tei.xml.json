               "Prediction of links-both new as well as recurring-in a social network representing interactions between individuals is an important problem. In the recent years, there is significant interest in methods that use only the graph structure to make predictions. However, most of them consider a single snapshot of the network as the input, neglecting an important aspect of these social networks viz., their evolution over time. in a variety of application scenarios: to predict the next academic collaborations between researchers, detection of unseen links in terrorist networks, and for suggesting new friendships in online social networking sites. In this work, we investigate the value of incorporating the history information available on the interactions (or links) of the current social network state. Our results unequivocally show that time-stamps of past interactions significantly improve the prediction accuracy of new and recurrent links over rather sophisticated methods proposed recently. Furthermore, we introduce a novel testing method which reflects the application of link prediction better than previous approaches. The link prediction problem has attracted immense interest in recent years, and a variety of techniques that operate on the graph/hypergraph structure of social networks are proposed. All link prediction methods address the following question: \"Given a pair of nodes u and v in the current social network, how likely is it that u will interact with v in the future?\"."

               "Social networks are ubiquitous -ranging from academic collaboration networks to terrorist networks, and from telephone calls between subscribers to online social interaction via Facebook, Orkut, LinkedIn, etc. These networks can be represented as graph and hypergraph structures where nodes represent people or other entities involved in the social interaction and an edge/hyperedge between them indicates presence of an interaction. Accurate prediction of new link formation or repeated occurrences of existing links is an important problem in this setting. Such link prediction is useful 1. We develop graph-based link prediction techniques that incorporate the temporal information contained in evolving social networks. In particular, we extend the local probabilistic model proposed by to include timeawareness. We show how to incorporate edge weightspossibly derived from temporal features-into the state-ofthe-art link prediction methods, such as the Adamic-Adar distance based and rooted PageRank based techniques .",

These facts are known as the locality of edge attachment and homophily . When the link prediction is treated as a binary classification, the following problem occurs in the selection of training and testing data points. The negative points are random pairs of vertices. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that they have any co-authors in common, that they work in the same field, or even that they are connected by some path.

In the first situation the network is modeled by a simple graph and new edges are created between vertices that are at distance two or higher. In the second situation, however, edges may appear not only between vertices at distance two or higher but also between vertices that are already connected (repeated edges). As we show later, the number of repeated edges in co-authorship networks can be as high as 50%. We can reasonably expect similar, if not larger, fraction of repeated edges in other networks corresponding to discrete events, such as telephone call networks or e-mail networks.",

Given a node v we calculate its neighborhood N (v) and output a list of vertices wN (v) according to the propensity that they will collaborate with v. The neighborhood N (v) does not be a neighborhood as defined in graph theory, i.e. elements of N (v) need not be linked with v. It makes sense, however, to build the neighborhood based on graph-theoretic measures. For instance, we can define N (v) as the direct and the distance-2 neighbors of v. This is a more natural view of the link prediction problem than the edge-centric approach. Moreover, we consider only pairs of vertices that are close to each other. Since some of the nodes collaborated with the central node recently and others a long time ago, link prediction methods benefit from time-awareness in the nodecentric scenario. This is not the case in the edge-centric approach, which focuses on deciding whether nodes are related in any way."

Thus, maximum entropy has exponential complexity and this limits the size of the neighborhood that can be processed. We empirically found that the maximum entropy methods work fast enough when there are at most 8 nodes in the neighborhood plus the central node. built maximum entropy models on neighborhoods of size 8, which is 1 less than in our experiments (8 neighbors + 1 central node). The problem with the complexity of maximum entropy methods was not evident in the edge-centric settings, where the subgraph connecting two nodes can be quite small. However, in the node-centric approach it means that we have to prune the neighborhood of the central node. We follow the simplest possible pruning algorithm: if a central node has more than 8 neighbors, we chose at random 8 of them.

They are mostly interested in communication network surveillance. It such scenario events, like emails or phone calls, may trigger another events. In their experiments they demonstrate that time aware methods compare favorably with commonly used time unaware methods. The best results can be achieved by a combination of both. Sharan and Neville followed a two-step approach to time-aware link prediction. First they summarize the dynamic graph with a weighted static graph, then they use the relational Bayes classifier. The experiments are performed on a heterogeneous data set of scientific collaborations and citations. Potgieter et al.",
               "studied temporal metrics in link prediction. Among other methods, they used moving averages and percentage of change of baseline metrics, such as common neighbors or Katz. Moreover, they used Dynamic Bayesian Networks to mine the relationships between metrics and formation of links."

               "In this work, we presented methods to incorporate temporal information available on evolving social networks for link prediction tasks. We showed that time of interactions between entities is a dominant feature for ranking neighboring nodes based on their probability of future interaction with the central node. This observation holds beyond the immediate direct neighborhood of the chosen node. A very simple time-aware method of (last,count)-based ranking is shown to outperform more other, more sophisticated, techniques in repeated link prediction. The performance of simple baseline predictors is improved by time-based weighting of edges. We also shown, that the performance of predictors is improved by weighting edges according to the connection strength between the authors.",
               "An important contribution of our work is a novel node-centric approach to the evaluation of link prediction. Our node-centric testing consist in ranking a set nodes close to a central node v according to the probability that they will collaborate with v. It resembles usage of real world link prediction systems, such as the People You May Know tool on Facebook.",
               "In the future we would like to test our link prediction methods on data sets other than scientific collaboration networks. We also would like to further investigate combining features for ranking nodes. Finally, we would like to look closer at the problem of disambiguating entities in the network. Both entity disambiguation and link prediction can use structure of the network. Therefore, there is a possibility of applying observations or methods from one field to the other."
