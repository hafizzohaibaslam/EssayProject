Individuals represent objects through names from a set N I = {a, b, . . .}. Each concept in the set N C = {C, D, . . .} is interpreted as a subset of a domain D. Each role in the set N R = {r, s, . . .} is interpreted as a binary relation on the domain. An assertion states that an individual belongs to a concept of that a pair of individuals satisfies a role.

Constructors in ALC are conjunction (C D), disjunction (C D), negation (?C), existential restriction (?r.C), and value restriction (?r.C). Concept inclusions and definitions are denoted respectively by Concept C ?C is denoted by , and concept C ?C is denoted by. The semantics of these constructs is given by a domain D and an interpretation I as follows: each individual a is mapped into an element a I ; each concept C is mapped into a subset C I of the domain; each role r is mapped into a binary relation r I in the domain; moreover, meaning that a randomly selected object is a Professor with probability. This characterizes a domain-based semantics: probabilities are assigned to subsets of the domain D. Sebastiani also allows inclusions such as P(Professor(John)) =, specifying probabilities over the interpretations themselves. For example, one interprets P(Professor(John)) = 0.001 as assigning 0.001 to be the probability of the set of interpretations where John is a Professor. The latter semantics characterizes an interpretation-based semantics.",

This assumption allows one to represent any terminology T through a directed acyclic graph. Such a graph, denoted by G(T ), has each concept name and role name as a node, and if a concept C directly uses concept D, that is if C and D appear respectively in the left and right hand sides of an inclusion/definition, then D is a parent of C in G(T ).

Other approaches to link prediction consider semantic features. The degree of semantic similarity among entities can be useful to predict links that might be missed by simple topological or frequency-based features . One way of capturing semantic similarity is by considering documents related to nodes in the network. A simple example of semantic similarity is the keyword match count between two authors . A more sophisticated method makes use of the well-known techniques such as TFIDF feature vector representation and the cosine measure to compute similarity .

More sophisticated models resort to hierarchical specification of link probabilities, or to grouping of nodes within blocks of varying probability.",

However, these languages are well suited to express independence relations between a fixed set of random variables; when nodes and links are to be dealt within graphs, it is best to consider modeling languages that can specify Markov random fields and Bayesian networks over relational structures. Indeed many proposals for link prediction resort to such languages, from seminal work by Getoor et al. and Taskar et al. . The presence of relational structure lets one to represent properties of individuals nodes, of links, of communities; one can then Given a network G where many links are observed, one is interested in predicting whether a link between nodes a and b exists (presumably the linkage between a and b has not been observed). We address this problem by considering, in addition to topological information about the network, knowledge about the domain concerning network entities. To do so, domain knowledge is represented through a probabilistic ontology using crALC. Among the concepts (N C ) and roles (N R ) in the ontology, there is a concept?Cconcept? concept?C that indicates which elements of the domain are nodes in G, and a rolrolr that indicates which pairs of elements are linked-henchencC and?rand? and?r describe the network itself, while other concepts and roles describe the remaining domain knowledge. In our experience, it is important to explicitly indicate which elements of the domain are nodes, to make sure inference runs only with the required elements (in effect this is providing a type that separates network nodes from other elements of the domain).",

               "In the second stage, we evaluate two features based on semantic similarity and their combination with topological features. Results on accuracy for these semantic features are depicted in (stage 2). The cosine similarity feature performs better than matching keyword feature and outperforms the two former topological features. When we combine all four features together, there is an improvement in accuracy considering datasets Lattes I and Lattes II. Dataset Lattes III was indifferent to the combination of all four features.",
               "Finally, in the third stage, a probabilistic feature based on crALC was introduced into the model. Results on accuracy for this feature are depicted in , showing it performs better than all other features. Moreover, there  is significant improvement in accuracy considering datasets Lattes 1 and Lattes 2, when all five features are combined.",
               "It is worth noting that the probabilistic logic feature used in isolation outperforms all other features and allows us to improve the classification model for link prediction on accuracy. It could be argued that such performance stems from evidence used on probabilistic inferences, but a similar analysis could be done for topological and semantic features. They use information that is missing on a probabilistic description logic setting. In conclusion, despite the fact that all features have different approaches, experimental results showed that they can be successfully used together.",

However, by doing  Average runtime for inference in crALC considering the number of nodes in the network # Nodes Runtime (ms) 10,000 168 100,000 175 chical structure can be encoded together with knowledge about specific nodes in a network-we plan to explore richer ontologies in the future. Moreover, our proposal attains better scalability than previous proposals that have tried to explore probabilistic relational models for similar purposes.",

These approaches do not scale well, since computing probabilistic inference for large networks is expensive. To overcome these performance and scalability issues, we resort to lifted inference in crALC which is based on variational methods-tuned by evidence defined according to the nodes's neighborhood. Thus, for a 10,000 possible nodes, if evidence is given for 5 nodes (this is the neighborhood for a given link candidate), then there are only 6 slices which have messages interchanged. To instantiate the overall network, we use local evidence to perform inference for every link candidate, i.e., neighborhood evidence is instantiated accordingly.",
               "In our experiments, the average runtime for inference in crALC (10,000 nodes network) was 168 ms. depicts some runtime results for larger networks, which demonstrates the scalability of our approach. A direct grounding of the ontology into a propositional Bayesian network would generate an unmanageably large model."

Given a collaborative network, we encode interests and graph features through a crALC probabilistic ontology. To predict links, we resort to probabilistic inference-thus we combine and extend previous work on relational probabilistic models of link prediction, and on ontology-based link prediction. To make the proposal scalable we propose a novel strategy for approximating link probabilities: for each pair of nodes, we focus only on evidence collected along paths between them. Our proposal was evaluated on an academic domain, where links among researchers were predicted. Moreover, the approach was successfully compared with graph-based and semantic-based features.",
