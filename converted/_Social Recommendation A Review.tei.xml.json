               "Recommender systems play an important role in helping online users find relevant information by suggesting information of potential interest to them. Due to the potential value of social relations in recommender systems, social recommendation has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we present a review of existing recommender systems and discuss some research directions. We begin by giving formal definitions of social recommendation and discuss the unique property of social recommendation and its implications compared with those of traditional recommender systems. Then, we classify existing social recom-mender systems into memory-based social recommender systems and model-based social recommender systems, according to the basic models adopted to build the systems, and review representative systems for each category. We also present some key findings from both positive and negative experiences in building social recommender systems, and research directions to improve social recommendation capabilities."

               "With the development of the World Wide Web, information has increased at an unprecedented rate and the information overload problem has become increasingly severe for online users. For example, when we want to buy a computer and search \"computer\" in Amazon, it returns 11,100,260 products . Recommender systems, which attempt to tackle the information overload problem by suggesting information that is of potential interest to online users, have become important and popular . For information customers, good recommendations allow them to quickly find relevant information buried in a large amount of irrelevant information. For information providers, recommender systems not only help determine which information to offer to individual consumers, but also improve consumer loyalty because consumers tend to return to the sites that best serve their needs . Such systems are widely implemented in various domains including, product recommendation on Amazon 2 and movie recommendation on Netflix . Recommender systems became an independent research area in the mid-1990s and have attracted much attention from multiple disciplines, such as mathematics, physics, psychology, and computer science . For example, the winners of the Netflix prize contest, one of the most famous competitions for recommendation, consist of psychologists, computer scientists, and physicists 4 . Many techniques are used to build recommender systems, which can be generally classified into content-based methods, collaborative filtering (CF) based methods, and hybrid methods . Content-based methods, rooted in information retrieval and information filtering research , recommend items similar to the ones the user preferred in the past; CF-based methods predict user interests directly by uncovering complex and unexpected patterns from a user's past behaviors and recommend items to a user from other users with similar interests and preferences in the past . Hybrid methods combine content-based and CF-based methods. We will give a brief review about techniques to build recommender systems in Section 2.",
               "The increasing popularity of social media greatly enriches people's social activities with their families, friends, and colleagues, which produces rich social relations such as friendships in Facebook , following relations in Twitter and trust relations in Epinions . Online social relations provide a different way for individuals to communicate digitally and allow online users to share ideas and opinions with their connected users. A user's preference is similar to or influenced by their socially connected friends and the rationale behind the assumption can be explained by social correlation theories such as homophily and social influence . Homophily indicates that users with similar preferences are more likely to be connected, and social influence reveals that users who are connected are more likely to have similar preferences. Analogous to the fact that users in the physical world are likely to seek suggestions from their friends before making a purchase decision and users' friends consistently provide good recommendations , social relations can be potentially exploited to improve the performance of online recommender systems .",

               "-Social recommendation has been developed for several years and still there is no agreement in literature on the definition of social recommendation. These clarifications are necessary for people to gain an awareness of social recommender systems. For example, Kaifu Lee, CEO at Innovation Works, recommended a particular brand of frozen dessert maker though Chinese tweet Sina Weibo platform and a few hours later, Taobao (China's eBay) had hundreds of sellers of the item and thousands of the machines were sold within a day. Subsequently, he wrote an article in LinkedIn entitled \"The Power of Social Recommendation\", but there are many doubts about whether this kind of recommendation can be called social recommendation 8 . -Social relations provide an independent source for recommendation; various approaches are proposed to build social recommender systems such as trust ensemble , trust propagation , and social regularization . A classification of existing social recommender systems can help users gain a quick understanding of many social recommender systems. A review of existing social recommender systems will let users familiarize themselves with the state-of-theart social recommender systems. -On the one hand, there is recent work reporting significant recommendation performance improvement for social recommender systems .",
               "On the other hand, there are also unsuccessful attempts at applying social recommendation . For example, IBM's Black Friday report says Twitter delivered 0 percent of referral traffic and Facebook sent just 0.68 percent . It is important to discuss key findings from both positive and negative experiences to seek a deeper understanding and further development of social recommender systems. -Social recommendation is still in the early stages of development, and there are many challenging issues needing further investigation. It is necessary to discuss some research directions that can improve social recommendation capabilities and make social recommendation applicable to an even broader range of applications.",

               "-We give narrow and broad definitions of social recommendation to cover most existing definitions of social recommendation in the literature and discuss the unique property of social recommender systems and its implications compared with traditional recommender systems; -We present a classification of social recommender systems according to the basic models to build social recommender systems, and review representative systems for each category in detail; -We summarize key findings from some positive and negative experiences in applying social recommender systems; -We discuss some research directions to improve recommendation capabilities including exploiting the heterogeneity of social networks and weak dependence connections, segmenting users and items, considering the temporal information of rating and social information, understanding the role of negative relations, and integrating cross-media social networks.",
               "The rest of this article is organized as follows. We review existing recommender systems including content-based methods, collaborative filtering based methods and hybrid methods in Section 2. In Section 3, we formally define social recommendation, discuss the unique property of social recommendation, classify and review existing social recommender systems, and discuss some key findings from both positive and negative experiences in applying social recommender systems. In Section 4, we discuss possible research directions for improvement of social recommendation. The article is summarized in Section 5."

For example, the density of the rating matrix in commercial recommender systems is often less than 1% . If item v j has attributes, we use x jR ? to represent v j where ? is the number of attributes.

               "Content based recommender systems have their roots in information retrieval and information filtering research . They recommend items similar to the ones that the user has preferred in the past. Most existing content based recommender systems focus on recommending items with textual information such as news, books and documents. The content in these systems is usually described with keywords and the informativeness of a keyword to a document is often measured by TFIDF weight . TF weight of a keyword to a document denotes the frequency of the keyword in the document, while IDF weight of a keyword is defined as the inverse document frequency of the keyword. Let x jk be the TFIDF weight of the k-th keyword in v j and the content of v j can be represented as x j = (x j1 , x j2 , . . . , x j? ). With these representations, content based recommender systems recommend items to a user which are similar to items the user liked in the past . In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user. A similarity measure such as a cosine similarity measure is adopted to score these candidate items. Besides the traditional heuristics based information retrieval methods, there are also content based recommender systems that use other techniques such as various classification and clustering algorithms .",
               "As noticed in , content based recommender systems have several limitations: (1) limited content analysis -these systems are difficult to apply to domains which have an inherent problem with automatic feature extraction such as multimedia data; (2) over-specialization -items recommended to a user are limited to those similar to items the user already rated; (3) new user problem -to let content based recommender systems understand a user's preference, the user has to rate a sufficient number of items, hence, content based recommender systems fail to recommend items for users with few or no ratings."

A narrow definition of social recommendation is any recommendation with online social relations as an additional input, i.e., augmenting an existing recommendation engine with additional social signals. Social relations can be trust relations, friendships, memberships or following relations. A tutorial with the title \"Introduction to Social Recommendation\" at the 19th international world wide web conference (WWW2010) followed this narrow definition . In this definition, social recommender systems assume that users are correlated when they establish social relations . For example, users' preferences are likely to be similar to or influenced by their connected friends. Under this assumption, social recommendation leverages user correlations implied by social relations to improve the performance of recommendation. Representative systems under this definition include TidalTrust , MoleTrust , SoRec , SocialMF , SoReg and LOCALBAL .",

The sources they use are not limited to online social relations but include all kinds of available social media data such as social tagging , user interactions and user click behaviors .",

However, online users are inherently connected via various types of relations such as friendships and trust relations. shows a simple example of connected users in social media, and Figures 1(b) and 1(c) demonstrate its two data representations for traditional recommender systems and social recommender systems, respectively. In addition to the rating matrix in traditional recommender systems, users in social recommender systems are connected, providing social information. Since they are connected, users are correlated rather than independent and identically distributed. For example, finds that users with following relations are more likely to share similar interests in topics than two randomly chosen users, and shows that users with trust relations are more likely to have similar preferences in item ratings. This phenomenon is observed in most online social networks and can be explained by social correlation theories such as homophily and social influence . Note that one user is more likely to have similar interests with her connected users than those randomly chosen users, which does not indicate that her connected users are equivalent to her most similar users w.r.t. rating information. Assume that u i connects to d users. We use C i and S i with the size d to denote sets of the connected users and the top-d similar users of u i , respectively. In , the authors show that the overlap between C i and S i is less than 10%, which is consistent with the observation in . If we change our perspective and consider connections as similarity measurements, social information provides similarity evidence and C i is the list of the similar users w.r.t. social information . Then the above observation can be explained by the key finding in -lists of similar users obtained by different sources are found to be highly different from each other. It also suggests that an aggregation of rating and social information may be valuable. In addition to similarity evidence, social information also provides another unique evidence, i.e., familiarity evidence, which is very importance in recommendation since in the physical world, we usually ask suggestions from our friends who are familiar with our tastes . Both similarity and familiarity evidence from social information indicate that social networks contain complementary information to rating information and provide an independent source of information about online users. Exploiting social relations can potentially improve recommendation performance.",

Therefore, our discussion in this article is focused on CF based social recommender systems. Social recommendation has two inputs, i.e., rating information and social information, as shown in (c). Most existing social recommender systems choose CF models as their basic models to build systems and propose approaches to capture social information based on results from social network analysis. Therefore, a general CF based social recommendation framework contains two parts: (1) a basic CF model and (2) a social information model, which can be formally stated as a social recommendation CF model = a basic CF model + a social information model",

For a given user, traditional user-oriented methods use similar users N , while memory based social recommender systems use correlated users N + obtained from both rating information and social information. Social recommender systems in this category usually follow two steps. First, they obtain the correlated users N + (i) for a given user u i , and second is the classical last step of memory based CF methods -aggregating ratings from the correlated users obtained by the first step for missing ratings. Different social recommender systems in this category use different approaches to obtain correlated users N + in the first step; next, we will present details about some representative approaches.",

The authors design a metric TidalTrust to estimate trust values among users based on the following two observations: (1) shorter propagation paths produce more accurate trust estimates; (2) paths with higher trust values create better results. To estimate trust values among users, TidalTrust performs the following steps, -searching a shortest path from the source user to raters and setting the shortest path length as the path depth of the algorithm; -computing trust value from the source user to a rater at the given depth. For a pair of users u i and u k who are not directly connected, a trust value is aggregated from the trust value from u i 's direct neighbors to u j , weighted by the direct trust values from u i to her direct neighbors as",

To obtain trust values, a large number of trust propagations have to be executed. Therefore, removing trust cycles beforehand from trust networks can significantly speed up the proposed algorithm because every user only needs to be visited once to infer trust values. With this operation, the original trust network is transformed into a directed acyclic graph. Second, trust values are calculated based on the obtained directed acyclic graph by performing a simple graph random walk: first the trust of the users at 1-hop away is computed, then the trust of the users at 2-hop away, etc.",

Second, MoleTrust needs a predefined trust threshold to determine users who will be considered in the rating aggregating process, while TidalTrust determines the trust threshold automatically, which denotes the path strength (the minimum trust rating on a path).",

First, a user's social network has little overlap with users similar to her , suggesting that social information provides an independent source of information. Second, ratings from strongly trusted friends on similar items are more reliable than ratings from weakly trusted neighbors on the same target item. The first observation indicates the importance of trust-based approaches while the second observation suggests the capability of item-oriented approaches. To take advantage of both approaches, TrustWalker proposes a random walk model to combine trust based and user oriented approaches into a coherent framework. It queries a user's direct and indirect friends' ratings for the target item as well as similar items by performing random walk in online social networks. For example, to obtain a rating for u i to v j . Suppose that we are at a certain node u k . Then TrustWalker works as follows at each step of a random work: if u k rated v j , then it stops the random walk and returns R kj as the result of random walk; otherwise, it has two choices -(1) it also stops random walk and randomly selects one of the items v",

               "Model-based social recommender systems choose model-based CF methods as their basic models. Matrix factorization techniques are widely used in model based CF methods. There are several nice properties of these matrix factorization techniques : (1) many optimization methods such as gradient based methods can be applied to find a well-worked optimal solution, scaled to thousands of users with millions of trust relations; (2) matrix factorization has a nice probabilistic interpretation with Gaussian noise; (3) it is very flexible and allows us to include prior knowledge. Most existing social recommender systems in this category are based on matrix factorization . The common rationale behind these methods is that users' preferences are similar to or influenced by users whom they are socially connected to. However, the low cost of social relation formation can lead to social relations with heterogeneous strengths (e.g., weak ties and strong ties mixed together) . Since users with strong ties are more likely to share similar tastes than those with weak ties, treating all social relations equally is likely to lead to degradation in recommendation performance. Therefore for each social relation, these methods associate a strength, which is usually calculated by rating similarity in existing social recommender systems. For example, when we choose cosine similarity, if u i and u k are connected , S ik is calculated as the cosine similarity between the rating vectors of u i and u k , otherwise we set S ik to 0. Therefore, the strength between u i and u k S ik can be formally defined as j R ijR kj",

According to different definitions of Social(T, S, ?), we further divide social recommender systems in this category into three groups: co-factorization methods, ensemble methods, and regularization methods. Next, we will review some representative systems in detail for each group. Co-factorization methods : The underlying assumption of systems in this group is that the i-th user u i should share the same user preference vector u i in the rating space (rating information) and the social space (social information). Social recommender systems in this group perform a co-factorization in the useritem matrix and the user-user social relation matrix by sharing the same user preference latent factor.

In Eq. , for two socially connected users u i and u k , their preference vectors u i and u k are correlated through H, which is controlled by their social strength S ik where HR KK is the matrix to capture the user preference correlation. A large value of S ik , i.e., u i and u k with a strong connection, indicates that their preferences u i and u k should be tightly correlated via H, while a small value of S ik indicates that u i and u k should be loosely correlated. Social(T, S, ?) can be applied to both directed and undirected social networks via the correlation matrix H. For a directed social network, the learned matrix H is asymmetric, while for an undirected social network, the learned matrix H is symmetric.",

Therefore, one advantage of approaches in this group is that they jointly perform recommendation and social relation prediction.",

               "In the physical world, users often seek recommendations from their friends; we have similar observations in the online worlds. For example, 66% of people on social sites have asked friends or followers to help them make a decision and 88% of links that 14-24 year olds clicked were sent to them by a friend and 78% of consumers trust peer recommendations over ads and Google SERPs . The intuition of social recommendation makes sense and that is why people believe social recommendation can potentially improve recommendation performance. There have been many successful social recommender systems proposed in recent years in academia as reviewed in the above subsections, and we summarize some key findings from these successful experiences below.",
               "First, online users are inherently correlated . They rarely make decisions independently and usually seek advice from their friends before making purchase decisions. A user's preference is more likely to be similar to that of her social network than to those of randomly chosen users. This phenomenon is widely observed in many online social networks such as following relations in Twitter and trust relations in Epinions . This phenomenon can be explained by wellstudied social theories such as homophily and social influence, which supports the utility of social recommendation. Furthermore, there is little overlap between a user's social network and her similar users . Connected users provide different information from similar users for recommendation, which can be exploited to improve the quality of recommendations .",
               "Second, to create good quality recommendations, traditional recommender systems need enough historical ratings from each user. Since the rating matrix is usually very sparse due to most users rating few of the millions of items, two users don't have enough of the number of items rated in common required by user similarity metrics to compute similarity. Therefore, the system is forced to choose neighbors in the small portion of comparable users and is probably going to miss other non-comparable but relevant users . Most of these systems are not able to generate accurate recommendations for users with few or no ratings. Social recommendation can make recommendations as long as the user is connected to a large enough component of the social network , hence social recommendation can significantly reduce cold-start users. For example, in , traditional recommender systems totally fail for new users, however, by considering ratings of trusted users, social recommendation achieves a very small error and is able to produce a recommendation for almost 17% of the users.",
               "Finally, on a very sparse dataset that contains a large portion of cold start users and of items rated by just one user, coverage becomes an important issue since many of the ratings become hardly predictable . Coverage refers to the fraction of ratings for which, after being hidden, the recommender systems are able to produce a predicted rating. By propagating trust, it is possible to reach more users; hence, to compute a predicted trust score among them and to count them as neighbors, social recommendation can improve the coverage of recommendation especially for new items. For example, in , traditional recommender systems cannot be applied to new locations; however, social recommendation can achieve more than 20% recommendation accuracy for new locations when exploiting social relations.",
               "In summary, the key findings from successful experiences are -(1) social information contains complementary information and results from social network analysis provide the necessary technical support for social recommendation; (2) users' opinions and tastes can be propagated via social networks, which can reduce the size of cold-start users; (3) social recommendation can significantly improve the coverage of recommendation."

However, a recent report shows that the startup ideas of social recommendations consistently fail . IBM's Black Friday report says Twitter delivered 0 percent of referral traffic and Facebook sent just 0.68 percent . Even in academia, unsuccessful attempts at social recommender systems are also reported . In this subsection, we summarize some key points from negative experiences in applying social recommender systems.",
               "First, the low cost of formation of connections allows one to have an inordinate number of friends in the online world. For example, a Facebook user has 130 friends on average, and an average Twitter user has 126 followers. Research by Robin Dunbar indicates that 100 to 150 is the approximate natural group size in which everyone can really know each other because our minds are not designed to allow us to have more than a very limited number of people in our social world. The emotional and psychological investments that a close relationship requires are considerable, and the emotional capital we have available is limited . Since the social network comprises of valuable friends, casual friends and event friends, users are not necessarily all that similar and social relations mixed with useful and noise connections may introduce negative information into recommender systems . For example, social recommender systems simply using all available relations perform worse than traditional recommender systems .",
               "Second, the available social relations are extremely sparse, and the distribution of the number of social relations follows a power-law-like distribution , suggesting that a small number of users specify many social relations while a large proportion of users specify a few relations. Users with many social relations are likely to be active users and they are likely to have many ratings, while users with fewer ratings are likely to also have fewer connections . For users with enough ratings, traditional recommender systems already perform well, while for users with fewer ratings, they are likely to also have fewer social relations and social recommender systems cannot help much. For example, social recommender systems in gain a little or even no improvement compared to traditional recommender systems.",
               "Finally, most existing successful social recommender systems use trust relations and recommend items to a user from her trusted users. Trust plays a central role in exchanging relationships involving unknown risk , which provides information about with whom we should share information and from whom we should accept information . The role of trust is especially critical in some online communities such as e-commerce sites and product review sites, which has been described as the \"wild wild west\" of the 21st century . These successful social recommender systems assume that trust relations are formed when users have similar opinions to similar products. With this assumption, users are likely to seek recommendations from their trusted friends and social recommender systems are likely to be successful. However, trust is a complex concept and has different interpretations in different contexts . A user in the context of product review sites such as Epinions will trust the users if she agrees with their opinions about products, while a user in the context of P2P networks will trust others because of their reliability. Different interpretations of trust may result in different solutions for social recommendation, which suggests that more nuanced approaches are needed to exploit trust relations for recommendation. Trust relations are not necessarily equivalent to other types of social relations. For example, following a user in Twitter does not indicate one's trust in the user. The success of exploiting trust relations for recommendation may not be applied to other relations, and different types of social relations may have very different impacts on social recommender systems .",
               "In summary, key findings from negative experiences in applying social recommender systems include -(1) social relations are too noisy and may have a negative impact on recommender systems; (2) cold-start users are likely to also have few or no social relations and it is difficult for social recommender systems to improve recommendation performance for these users; and (3) different types of social relations have different effects on social recommender systems, and successful experiences in exploiting trust relations may not be applicable to other types of relations."

Therefore, metrics that evaluate traditional recommender systems can also be applied to evaluate social recommender systems.",
               "To evaluate recommender systems, the data is usually divided into two partsthe training set K (known ratings) and the testing set U (unknown ratings). Recommender systems will be trained based on K, and the quality of recommendation will be evaluated in U. Different evaluation metrics are proposed to evaluate the quality of recommendation from different perspectives, such as prediction accuracy, ranking accuracy, diversity and novelty, and coverage. Prediction accuracy and ranking accuracy are two widely adopted metrics.",
               "Prediction Accuracy: Prediction accuracy measures the closeness of predicted ratings to the true ratings. Two widely used metrics in this category are Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).",

               "Ranking Accuracy: Ranking accuracy evaluates how many recommended items are purchased by the user. Precision and recall are two popular metrics in this category. Recall captures how many of the acquired items are recommended, while precision captures how many recommended items are acquired, for example, Prec@N is used to indicate how many top-N recommended items are acquired. Long recommendation lists typically improve recall, while reducing precision. Therefore F-score is a metric combining them, and it is less dependent on the length of the recommendation list.",

First, although some datasets are publicly available, there are still no agreed benchmark datasets for social recommendation. Second, social recommendation is a complex problem and different algorithms are designed to capture its different aspects. For example, algorithms in are for controversial items, while MoleTrust is for cold-start users. Third, some algorithms may require additional sources to capture social information more effectively, for example, mTrust needs the category information of items , therefore, it is difficult to seek a fair comparison for all systems. However, there are some common questions to answer when accessing a recommender system including (1) which datasets we are going to adopt; (2) which metrics we will use; (3) what kinds of items we want to recommend; and (4) which kinds of users we want to recommend to. To help readers further understand the assessment process, we summarize evaluations of representative social recommender systems w.r.t. these questions in ."

If users in the physical world only had strong dependence connections, then life would be pretty boring since strong dependence connections indicate strong similarities. Actually, users can establish weak dependence connections with others in social networks when they are not directly connected. Weak dependency connections can provide important context An illustration of u 1 's social connections information about users' interests, and are proven to be useful in job hunting , the diffusion of ideas , knowledge transfer and relational learning , while rarely used in recommendation.",
               "Identifying weak dependence connections for recommendation is an interesting direction to investigate. One possible way to find weak dependence connections is to exploit users' geo-locations. For example, notices that users geographically close are likely to share similar interests, and that users geographically close are likely to visit similar locations . Another possible way is to detect groups in social networks. Connected users in online social networks form groups where there are more connections among users within groups than among those between groups . For example, in , {u 1 , u 2 , u 3 , u 10 , u 11 , u 12 } form a group while {u 1 , u 3 , u 5 , u 13 , u 14 , u 15 } form another group.

Temporal information is an important factor in recommender systems and there are traditional recommender systems that consider temporal information . Temporal dynamics in data can have a more significant impact on accuracy than designing more complex learning algorithms . Exploiting temporal information for recommender systems is still challenging due to the complexity of users' temporal patterns . Social relations also change over time. For example, new social relations are added, while existing social relations become inactive or are deleted. The changes of both ratings and social relations further exacerbate the difficulty of exploiting temporal information for social recommendation. A preliminary study of the impact of the changes in both ratings and trust relations on recommender systems demonstrates that temporal information can benefit social recommendation ."

There are several works exploiting distrust in social recommender systems. They treat trust and distrust separately, and simply use distrust in an opposite way to trust such as filtering distrusted users or considering distrust relations as negative weights. However, trust and distrust are shaped by different dimensions of trustworthiness, and trust affects behavior intentions differently from distrust . Furthermore, distrust relations are not independent of trust relations .

When the user registers at eBay for the first time as a coldstart user, data about the user in Epinions can help eBay solve the cold-start problem and accurately recommend items to the user. Integrating networks from multiple websites can bring about a huge impact on social recommender systems and provide an efficient and effective way to solve the cold-start problem. The first difficulty of integrating data is connecting corresponding users across websites and there is recent work proposed to tackle this mapping problem .

In this paper, we first give a narrow definition and a broad definition of social recommendation to cover most existing definitions of social recommendation in literature, and discuss the unique feature of social recommender systems as well as its implications. We classify current social recommender systems into memorybased social recommender systems and model-based social recommender systems according to the basic models chosen to build the systems, and then present a review of representative systems for each category. We also discuss some key findings from positive and negative experiences in applying social recommender systems. Social recommendation is still in the early stages of development and needs further improvement. Finally we present research directions that can potentially improve performance of social recommender systems including exploiting the heterogeneity of social networks and weak dependence connections, microcosmic investigation of users and items, considering temporal information in rating and social information, understanding the role of negative relations, and integrating cross-media data."
