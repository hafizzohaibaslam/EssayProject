The last characteristic of openness leads to its impact to dynamic modification of problem solving ability.

As posited by ''Higher-order thinking strategies involve three cognitive processes: differentiation, integration, and construction of knowledge. The first two processes occur primarily in the retrieval system of memory while the third further involves the other components of the entire cognitive system. . . . The operational term for the retrieval system functions of differentiation and integration is cognitive complexity . Cognitive complexity, as contrasted to intelligence, is an ability that can be developed and improved with direct instructional intervention. Differentiation is defined as a two-fold cognitive process as follows: (a) the ability to understand a given situation; and (b) the ability to apply appropriate criteria by which to select necessary knowledge from storage. Integration is the process of forming new schema(s) from selected knowledge. Construction is the process to form new knowledge by employing the total cognitive system.'' Based on Athey's work (1976), Oren (1978) elaborated on the importance of increasing cognitive complexity of an individual (or to assign another person with higher cognitive complexity) to increase the effectiveness in coping with complex situations. shows different levels of information processing of an individual depending on the situational complexity. For a low situational complexity, the individual may need to have low level of information processing to cope with the situation. If the situational complexity increases, his/her information processing level may also increase. However, for each individual there is a critical point beyond which the level of processed information hence the individual's information processing effectiveness is decreased. After the critical point, an increase in the situational complexity may worsen the individual's ability to cope with complexity, by causing a decrease in his/her level of information processing.",

Thus increasing the cognitive complexity of an individual -within the applicable limits of course -may increase the range of situational complexity within which he/she can perform effectively. Or depending on the task, it may be advisable to assign an individual with cognitive complexity commensurate with the task. Second, for a given situational complexity s, the level of information processed for a high cognitive complexity individual i h is greater than i l which corresponds to a low cognitive complexity individual.",

The degree of a facet is its weighted value (equal to the product of its measured value by its weight factor as determined from factor analysis).

Fuzzy set class is the base of this implementation and has been used in fuzzy rule class. Fuzzy rule class has been used in fuzzy rule base class and then, for each cluster of personality rules, a fuzzy rule base has been created. The brief explanation of each class is as follows:",

Fuzzy set class (FuzzySet.java): A fuzzy set can be defined, using personality factor based on the values of the facets and definition of the membership functions that reasonably map the personality traits value into their corresponding belief values. These values have been used as the attributes of fuzzy set class. We measure the degree of membership of each value by evoking the ''MembershipDegree'' method of this class. 2. Fuzzy rule class (FuzzyRule.java): This class uses fuzzy set class. By definition of a fuzzy rule object, it is possible to insert antecedent and conclusion parts to each rule by evoking ''AddAntecedent'' and ''AddConclusion'' methods of this class. Antecedent and conclusion are two attributes of this class. The method of ''TestRuleMatch'' has been used for verification whether the rule has been fired or not. This method assigns ''True'' or ''False'' to the ''fire rule'' attribute of this class. If the antecedent of rule is complex, the AND operator will be applied between the parts of antecedents. For calculation the degree of ''fire rule (DOF)'', the ''minimum'' technique ( ) has been applied. After calculation of DOF (via ''TestRuleMatch'' method), we can calculate the output fuzzy set by evoking ''GetOutputSet'' method. This method, evaluates the fuzzy relation between antecedent and conclusion of each rule, using ''Larsen Product'' technique ( . 3. Fuzzy rule base class (FuzzyRuleBase.java): By creating an instance of this class, it is possible to define a cluster of rules, and doing fuzzification, fuzzy inference and defuzzification on the rules, we can finally calculate the output results. Some important attributes of this class are an array of fuzzy rules, the number of fuzzy rules and the number of fired fuzzy rules after inference. We can add the predefined fuzzy rules to a fuzzy rule base, by evoking the method of ''Add Rule''. The ''fuzzification'' method, fuzzificates the input value of the rule base. The method of ''Inference'' of rule base, catches the fuzzificated values and then obtains the DOF of each rule by evoking ''TestRuleMatch'' method of that rule. If DOF is higher than zero, the rule will be considered as a fired rule. The method of ''defuzzification'' can be used for calculation of final result. For this purpose, this method applies the fuzzy centroid technique . For each of four clusters of designed fuzzy personality rules in this paper, we have defined an instance of fuzzy rule base class. The software is implemented in Java environment and contains an agent with dynamic personality. Each facet has a weight factor. In the determination of the overall value of a trait, the weighted value of each facet is  computed by multiplying its measured value by the weight factor. The dominant facet determines the value of the trait. The outputs in show personality descriptors, personality factors, personality style, and problem solving success consequently."
