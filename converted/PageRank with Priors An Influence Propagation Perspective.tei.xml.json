               "Recent years have witnessed increased interests in measuring authority and modelling influence in social networks. For a long time, PageRank has been widely used for authority computation and has also been adopted as a solid baseline for evaluating social influence related applications. However, the connection between authority measurement and influence modelling is not clearly established. To this end, in this paper, we provide a focused study on understanding of PageRank as well as the relationship between PageRank and social influence analysis. Along this line, we first propose a linear social influence model and reveal that this model is essentially PageRank with prior. Also, we show that the authority computation by PageRank can be enhanced with more generalized priors. Moreover, to deal with the computational challenge of PageRank with general priors, we provide an upper bound for top authoritative nodes identification. Finally, the experimental results on the scientific collaboration network validate the effectiveness of the proposed social influence model."

               "As people becoming more inextricably linked through the power of information technology, huge social network data have been collected. These network data provide unparallel opportunities for researchers to understand the human world and generate useful knowledge. Indeed, tremendous efforts have been made for measuring authority and modelling social influence .",
               "Generally, in traditional social network analysis, the term authority is used for estimating the endorsement that is received by the node from its inlinks, and the classic models include PageRank and HITS , which were first proposed for ranking web pages. However, social influence (or influence for short) is the impact that an individual has on others (e.g., leading to the change of their opinions or behaviors) from their outlinks. The Independent Cascade (IC) model and the Linear Threshold (LT) model are two of the most popular models for describing influence propagation. In fact, a web page is ranked highly if many authoritative pages point to it, and an individual is valued most if he/she influences many influential people. While authority and influence appear quite different at a first glance, several researchers have sensed that they are essentially the same: The individual earns authority by influencing others. This is also the reason that the PageRank algorithm has been used as a solid baseline for evaluating social influence related applications .",
               "Nonetheless, there are still two questions to answer. First, what is the connection between PageRank and social influence models. Second, can social influence models help better understand the authority values obtained by PageRank? To answer these two questions, in this paper, we first propose a linear and tractable social influence model which is an approximation of the IC model (which is untractable). Then, we show that this linear model is essentially PageRank with prior, i.e., the PageRank algorithm is actually a special case of this linear model. Therefore, we argue that the authority of each node is essentially the collection of its influences on the network or a specific subnetwork. Based on this finding, we reveal that many similar and effective authority computation methods, which consider more prior knowledge, can be obtained by simply changing the parameter settings in the proposed linear model. Meanwhile, we show that the PageRank value can be used to form an upper bound, which is further used to develop an efficient algorithm for finding the most authoritative nodes with general priors. Finally, we validate these discoveries by performing experiments on a real-world collaboration network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive attempt for exploring and building connections between the researches on PageRank and influence, with a focus on understanding both the traditional and topic-sensitive PageRanks in an influence perspective."

Also, an alternative way is to use priors to obtain a nonuniform personalization vector instead of 1 n e .

In IC model, the activated/influenced nodes have a single chance to influence their neighbors independently with a probability. This iterative propagation process will not stop until there is no newly influenced node. The IC model where each link shares the same propagation probability is called the Uniform IC Model, and the one with edge weights is called the Weighted Cascade (WC) Model ].",

However, most of the existing models are usually untractable. To that end, a large number of Monte Carlo simulations are needed. To improve computational efficiency, many heuristics have been proposed. For instance, Leskovec et al. designed the cost-effective lazy forward (CELF) optimization, and Chen et al. proposed both the Degree Discount heuristic and the Maximum Influence Path heuristic. Similarly, Kimura et al. proposed the shortest-path based influence algorithm. Aggarwal et al. proposed the SteadyStateSpread method by solving a system of nonlinear equations for computing the influence spread under the IC model. Moreover, Yang et al. observed that propagation probabilities in realworld networks are usually quite small, and thus proposed a quick approximation of influence spread by solving a linear system. In addition, many researchers also consider some constraints in practice. For instance, both Chen et al. and included time constraints into their approximation algorithms, and Tang et al. proposed topical affinity propagation to model the topic-level social influence."

However, in the realworld each initiator may not spread the thing with 100% probability (e.g., for lack of self-confidence), i.e., we should take prior knowledge into the first assumption for describing how much probability the node spreads influence to the neighbors.

For better understanding, we also illustrate the true authority value (computed by S ame() and Prior() respectively) and the upper bounds for 1, 500 randomly selected researchers in , where we can observe that the upper bounds are always close to the real authority values and this is the reason that each method just has to scan a limited number of candidates for finding the most authoritative researchers ).

               "Specifically, .(a) demonstrates the coefficient of the top authoritative researcher set between different research domains, and .(b) are the coefficient of the top authoritative researcher set output by different methods. In .(a) all the five methods' output researchers for one domain are summarized together to stand for this domain, and similarly, in .(b) all the six research domains' top researchers gained by the given method are used to stand for this specific method. From .(a) we can see that the top researchers mined from the entire network are selected from each single domain which is supported by the similar coefficients between Total domain with six single domains. Among these six domains, CV is the most independent one and has few research connections with others, and the top researchers in AI only have limited connections with those in ML. It is also very interesting to observe that DB, DM and In this paper, we provided an understanding of PageRank and authority from an influence propagation perspective. Along this line, we first developed a linear social influence model, which generalizes the authority computation of PageRank by introducing priors. Also, we revealed that the authority of each node is essentially the collection of its influence on the network or a specific subnetwork. Furthermore, we showed that many similar and effective authority computation methods, which consider more prior knowledge, can be obtained by different parameter settings in the proposed linear social influence model. Meanwhile, we found that the PageRank value can be used to form an upper bound for efficiently computing the most authoritative nodes. Finally, an empirical study was conducted on a real-world DBLP data set to show the effectiveness of the proposed social influence model. In the future, we plan to further evaluate our finding using more data and analyze the connection between authority and influence on other influence models (e.g., IC model, LT model)."
