               "Purchasing decisions are often strongly influenced by people who the consumer knows and trusts. Moreover, many online shoppers tend to wait for the opinions of early adopters before making a purchase decision to reduce the risk of buying a new product. Web-based social communities, actively fostered by E-commerce companies, allow consumers to share their personal experiences by writing reviews, rating others' reviews, and chatting among trusting members. They drive the volume of traffic to retail sites and become a starting point for Web shoppers. E-commerce companies have recently started to capture data on the social interaction between consumers in their websites, with the potential objective of understanding and leveraging social influence in customers' purchase decision making to improve customer relationship management and increase sales. In this paper, we present an overview of the impact of social influence in E-commerce decision making to provide guidance to researchers and companies who have an interest in related issues. We identify how data about social influence can be captured from online customer behaviors and how social influence can be used by E-commerce websites to aid the user decision making process. We also provide a summary of technology for social network analysis and identify the research challenges of measuring and leveraging the impact of social influence on E-commerce decision making. commerce websites without finding what they want [27]. Richer E-commerce systems that connect companies to their customers could enhance customers' decision making and their bottom line [25]. E-commerce companies are attempting to support part of their potential customers' decision making process by introducing personalized Web-based decision support systems such as recommender systems. These recommender systems provide consumers with personalized recommendations based on their purchase history, past ratings' profile, or interests. These collaborative filtering based recommender systems have been applied to many E-commerce websites (e.g., movie, music, and restaurant recommendation) and shown good performance in predicting a list of products which a consumer prefers. A typical collaborative filtering algorithm builds a customer's neighborhood based on his or her preferences of shared products and weighs the interest of neighbors with similar taste to generate new recommendations [5]."

Over 80% of Web shoppers have at some point left EApproaches incorporating social influence into recommender systems or online marketing in E-commerce have started gaining momentum. Some researchers have suggested social recommender systems that take into account social interaction in combination with purchase preferences and profiles when generating recommendations. Lam proposed a collaborative recommender system incorporating social network information, called Social Network in Automated Collaborative-filtering of Knowledge (SNACK). The similarity weight for users' ratings was modified according to the network distance (i.e., the length of the shortest path) between two users, and the preference of closed network neighbors was emphasized. Massa et al. built a trust model using trust data from Epinions.com to predict the trust value that is propagated within a network and used to make recommendations. These social recommender systems have been observed to achieve better prediction rates, and have also solved the cold-start problem in which a new user does not have enough product preferences for the system to make good predictions. The measure of social influence and trust value in a Web-based social network increasingly appears to be an important key to enhancing the accuracy of recommender systems.",
               "Some researchers have focused on the consumer networks that are formed through the direct and indirect interactions (e.g., to read and rate reviews) between consumers to maximize the impact of direct marketing through social influence. Models have been proposed to identify a set of highly influential customers to maximize word-of-mouth effects or to find target customers based on the preferences and influencial impact from previous customers,. Domingos et al. proposed a model to mine a customer's network value and optimize the choice of which customers to market to. solved the optimization problem of selecting highly influential customers to maximize the spread of influence through a social network. In these efforts, a measure of social influence such as cascading effects and network value is one of the key issues. Hill et al. suggest networkbased marketing using existing customers to identify potential customers who are likely to buy, based upon being influenced by previous customers who have bought a service. This was done in the domain of telecommunication services.",
               "influence among its members . A Web-based social network provides various methods such as a chat room and a discussion forum for participants who can interact, exchange opinions, and compare experiences with others. In the context of E-commerce, social networks emerge since many websites help a consumer's final purchase decision by sharing reviews written by previous customers and evaluated by potential customers 1 . Many online shoppers tend to wait for early adopters' opinions before making a purchase decision to reduce the risk of buying a new product . Bearden et al. observed the existence of two kinds of social influence in the adoption of a new product: normative social influence (or subjective norms) and informational social influence. Normative social influence creates social pressure for people to adopt a product or a service because people not adopting a product may be treated as \"old fashioned\" regardless of the individual's preference toward the product. Informational social influence is a learning process through which people observe the experience of early adopters in their social network and decide whether to buy the new product. Thus, informational social influence can have a moderating role between customers' attitudes toward a product and their intention to buy it, by enhancing consumers' confidence in their preferences and beliefs toward the product .",
               "Although some emerging research has started to incorporate social influence in E-commerce, it has been limited to data sources about social interaction captured from E-commerce interactions only, which is only a subset of the information that is becoming available. In this paper, we present an overview of the impact of social influence in E-commerce decision making to provide guidance to researchers and E-commerce companies. Specifically, we examine various ways to capture social influence using an E-commerce platform and also discuss how captured data about social influence can be used by E-commerce websites to aid users' decision making process. We also survey current technology for social network analysis which could be adopted and modified for analysis of E-commerce social interactions. We discuss research challenges of measuring and leveraging the impact of social influence. Although we do not provide a specific methodology or algorithm in this paper, our understanding of social influence in E-commerce could be a starting point to develop strategies and methodologies for a social interaction based E-commerce decision making system. An approach to measuring the social influence between consumers of an E-commerce website provides multiple benefits. First, online shoppers are provided a number of high quality and personalized reviews of a product from trusted sources to convince them to buy. Second, a company producing a product may get customers' direct and detailed responses and be in a better position to predict market trends. Third, an E-commerce website can identify opinion leaders with high influence and maximize the effectiveness of marketing based on a social network surrounding opinion leaders. In recent work , network based marketing and viral marketing has proven to be more cost-effective than traditional direct marketing, which treats the customer as an independent decision maker and ignores the effect of the surrounding network. The premise of viral marketing is that targeting a few influential consumers initially can trigger a cascade of influence through a social network in which friends will voluntarily share their experiences or recommend the product to other friends . Thus, a company We begin by identifying the impact of social influence in various aspects of E-commerce in Section 2 and then describe how to exercise social influence on a customer's decision making process with an example in Section 3. We provide a summary of technology for social network analysis in Section 4 and discuss research challenges in Section 5. We conclude the paper in Section 6."

               "Therefore, constructing a social network using interactions between consumers and finding the important nodes, i.e., influential customers in the constructed social network has been a key issue for marketers as well as sociologists for some time. Many kinds of centrality measures have been developed, e.g. degree centrality, which treats high degree nodes as important and distance centrality, which treats nodes with short paths to many other nodes as important . Some online communities such as Epinions.com encourage users to provide trust data, where users explicitly express their trust of other participants, leading to the construction of personalized webs of trust. Many E-commerce websites such as Amazon.com allow a consumer to buy a product as a gift for friends and to recommend it to friends. Consumers write product reviews and also express how useful the reviews written by other consumers are. However, in general, most social networks are formed and maintained through informal, qualitative and unobserved interaction and thus it is difficult to find a social network in E-commerce websites . Few researchers have studied how social influence propagates in E-commerce websites and how to use it for influencing customers' decision making in Ecommerce. Most research has focused on identifying social networks in web communities and e-mail networks, which have many kinds of interactions such as reading, posting, commenting, and forwarding."

For instance, consider a customer, Jane, who wants to buy a book about \"social networks\" in an online shopping site. Decision 1: Jane recognizes a need to buy a book about \"social networks.\" She has to decide if she will go to Amazon.com where she shops often, or try another online store such as Barnes & Nobles. Sometimes, she also decides if it is worthwhile to visit a Web-based community site such as Epinions.com in advance to search for information about a product. Decisions 2 & 3: Upon deciding to visit Amazon.com, she searches for a book about \"social networks.\" She reads editorial reviews, sample pages, customers' reviews about a few books and compares them based on her preference (e.g., not too thick, soft cover, and for a beginner), price, customers' reviews and reviews' ratings, as evaluated by other customers. At this point, she has to determine which book to buy and decide if she would like to rate some reviews that were helpful in making a purchase decision. Decision 4: After selecting the book to buy, she has to decide if she should buy the book at Amazon.com or some other store, which might potentially offer better shipping options or lower prices. Decision 5: When she decides to place an order at Amazon.com, she is recommended a set of books, which were frequently purchased together. She decides whether to buy the recommended books or not. Decision 6: After reading the book which she bought, the customer considers writing a review to share her opinion and to help other customers' decision making. She also decides to rate some reviews that influenced her purchase decision of the product based on the reviews' accuracy or honesty. Decision 7: She also decides whether or not she should rate the book. She knows that she can receive more personalized recommendations from Amazon.com when she rates products she has purchased most often.",
               "For example, Amazon.com provides consumers with their \"Customer Review Discussion Board\" where they post a review and comment on others' reviews and also express which reviewers they ignored (i.e., distrust) and which reviewers they have added to a friend list (i.e., trust). Amazon.com also encourages consumers to invite friends to this interesting board. Consumers who have some common interests (i.e., preferences) and trust others' opinions could have social interaction in a community which is constructed around a product even though they do not know the others personally. Therefore, E-commerce companies like Amazon.com could capture data about connections between a customer and trusted members in a product community. Ecommerce companies also could achieve the data about trust from a Web-based social network like Epinions.com if users in Epinions.com allow them to use the information, because Webbased social networks have a \"Web of trust\" which is constructed by users' expressed trust data and is less sparse than that of Ecommerce.

The customer also wants to reduce the risk of buying a new product and effectively make a satisfactory decision. A company could reduce the search space which has a small set of products to be compared in detail by recommending a few products based on opinion leaders' ratings in a product category (i.e., the best rated) or friends or trusted members' ratings. Ecommerce websites can also assist in the consumer's final decision of selecting one product by offering previous customers' opinions (i.e., reviews) which are rated as \"high quality.\" Most Ecommerce websites encourage customers to write a review and rate reviews written by others; therefore, they can identify influential customers called opinion leaders based on how many reviews the customers wrote and how much credit the customers receive. For example, when a consumer tries to search for a book about \"social network\" using a keyword \"social network,\" Ecommerce websites could sort relevant books according to the average rating calculated by high quality reviews (e.g. 50% of the people found the review helpful). Among the sorted products, Ecommerce could recommend opinion leaders' choices with their reviews and their ratings. If E-commerce websites could provide the ratings of reviews which are rated after customers buy the product (i.e., Decision step 6), the ratings will be more helpful in deciding to buy the product or not because they can show how accurate and honest the reviews are.

These measures compute rankings or scores over a subset of actors in a social network which indicate degree of importance or expertise . The central nodes often play a role by issuing information, ideas and influence, or bridging different communities . The removal of central nodes could disrupt a network more than peripheral nodes. In other words, the central nodes could be effectively used to maximize social influence within a social network. Degree measures how active or popular a particular node is. It is defined as the number of direct links a node has. Betweenness measures how many times a particular node lies in a shortest path between two nodes. Nodes with high betweenness scores often act as communication channels like brokers and gatekeepers between different communities that transmit resources . Closeness is defined as the sum of the length of the shortest path between a particular node and all other nodes in a network. The PageRank algorithm measures the importance of web pages by analyzing the underlying hyperlink structure of web pages. The HIT algorithm discovers authoritative information sources on a topic based on the relationship between a set of relevant authoritative pages and the set of hub pages that join them together in the link structure. Theses centrality measures can be used to rank consumers based on the amount of influence on customers' purchase decision making and identify opinion leaders who often write reviews earlier than other consumers in some categories the unobserved social links, given a social network with an incomplete set of social links between a complete set of actors, and 3) to predict the social link between actors, given information about actors or to predict a trust value given a small set of expressed trust or distrust among actors .

To measure link density, centrality measures such as betweenness, degree, and closeness could be used. In an E-commerce environment, mining cohesive subgroups where consumers have relatively strong connections and similar purchase behavior or common interests is a key issue for marketers in order to maximize the word-of-mouth effect in an individual subgroup. E-commerce companies have two types of relevant information for the present discussion, namely user preference information and social influence information. As shown in , a product rating matrix is constructed with data from a purchase cycle and is used to develop a user preference similarity matrix. Current recommender systems make personalized recommendations using a product rating matrix and user preference similarity matrix. A user interaction matrix is constructed with data from a review cycle. A user trust matrix can be developed based on the user interaction matrix, using the above described SNA techniques. The trust matrix shows who an individual consumer trusts and who an individual customer is trusted by, which can be used to identify highly influential customers. At this point, an Ecommerce company should consider how to combine the user preference information, contained in the product rating matrix and user preference similarity matrix, and the social influence information, contained in the user interaction matrix and user trust matrix. This would be one of the success factors of E-commerce decision support systems. Moreover, the approach of combing user preferences and social influence in E-commerce is an important future research area.

               "Recently, social recommender systems, which integrate information from product rating matrix, user preference similarity matrix and user trust matrix to generate a recommendation, have received more attention (See . The systems can make a personalized recommendation to a target customer's trusted social circle by understanding the influence the target customer has over his or her social circle. However, a number of issues need to be addressed before such recommendation can become a reality. Specifically, to improve the quality of a social recommender system and to leverage social influence with the system, the following questions must be answered: personality of the target customer, and how can this be factored in?",

               "y A consumer is not interested in a product according to her consumer preference information. However, others in her social circle rate the product highly. Should a recommender system recommend the product to the consumer? To what degree is this a function of the If there is a strong relationship between the user preference similarity and trust value among users and if the strength of the relationship can be measured exactly, then a social recommender system can increase the accuracy of a recommendation and mitigate the weaknesses of a traditional recommender system such as a cold-start problem and a sparse problem by combining the trust matrix. Therefore, the preciseness of the trust matrix significantly affects the performance of the social recommender system. Therefore, different propagation mechanisms should be examined to construct an accurate trust matrix in a particular application. The trust value can be used as an alternative value of a preference similarity or complementary weight when calculating a recommendation prediction."

However, both the properties of relationships between social actors (e.g., intensity and frequency of relationships) and the attribute of social actors (e.g., their age, gender, preference and interests) are believed to influence the social network structure .

As Web-based social networks have become more popular, consumers who may not have complete information about a product or service often make use of previous customers' opinions. It has become apparent that the customer decision process is influenced by information from trusted people, not from product manufacturers or recommendation systems. The social influence from high quality reviews written by previous consumers can have a direct, positive effect on potential consumers' decision making, and this effect can propagate through a social network. E-commerce companies are well positioned to take advantage of the social influence between consumers as a decision support tool by allowing a consumer to evaluate the appropriateness of recommendations and reviews. Ecommerce companies can ultimately increase sales with less marketing cost. Thus, we believe that social influence becomes a natural supplement that can be advantageously used by corporations in the E-commerce decision making process.",

               "The answers to the above questions start from the principle of direct marketing: market to the most valuable customers whose expected profit is greater than the cost of a marketing action. While a traditional direct marketing method has intrinsic value for gaining customers (i.e., the expected long-term or short-term profit from sales to the customer), network-based marketing (i.e., viral marketing, word-of-mouth marketing) emphasizes network value that is derived from a customer's influence on other customers as much as intrinsic value . Therefore, the ability to quantify network value or network effect is a key step to determine the initial target customers, the number of target customers, the optimal marketing cost, the optimization of subgroup for marketing and so on. The network value of a customer could be measured based on a customer's network neighbor size, the purchase probability of network neighbors and the influence of other members affected by the strength of connectivity and preference similarity among network neighbors."
