Changing nearest neighbor sets is an inherent property of the Vicsek model and in the other models we consider. To analyze such models, it proves useful to appeal to well-known results , characterizing the convergence of infinite products of certain types of nonnegative matrices. The study of infinite matrix products is ongoing - , and is undoubtedly producing results which will find application in the theoretical study of emergent behaviors.",

A family of simple graphs on vertices is then introduced to characterize all possible neighbor relationships. Doing this makes it possible to represent the Vicsek model as an -dimensional switched linear system whose switching signal takes values in the set of indices which parameterize the family of graphs. The matrices which are switched within the system turn out to be nonnegative with special structural properties. By exploiting these properties and making use of a classical convergence result due to Wolfowitz , we prove that all agents' headings converge to a common steady state 0018-9286/03$17.00 ? 2003 IEEE heading provided the agents are all \"linked together\" via their neighbors with sufficient frequency as the system evolves.

We propose one such model which assumes each agent knows an upper bound on the number of agents in the group, and we explain why this model has convergence properties similar to Vicsek's.",
               "In Section III, we consider a modified version of Vicsek's discrete-time system consisting of the same group of agents, plus one additional agent, labeled 0, which acts as the group's leader. Agent 0 moves at the same constant speed as its followers but with a fixed heading . The th follower updates its heading just as in the Vicsek model, using the average of its own heading plus the headings of its neighbors. For this system, each follower's set of neighbors can also include the leader and does so whenever the leader is within the follower's neighborhood defining circle of radius . We prove that the headings of all agents must converge to the leader's provided all agents are \" linked to their leader\" together via their neighbors frequently enough as the system evolves. Finally, we develop a continuous-time analog of this system and prove under condition milder than imposed in the discrete-time case, that the headings of all agents again converge to the heading of the group's leader.",

Of course it is entirely possible that in the limit as , a heading might approach the value ; any such limiting value is interpreted as a heading of 0. Analogous statement apply to all other models considered in the sequel. Accordingly, throughout the paper headings at any finite time , are represented as real numbers in . The explicit form of the update equations determined by (1) and (2) depends on the relationships between neighbors which exist at time . These relationships can be conveniently described by a simple, undirected graph 2 with vertex set which is defined so that is one of the graph's edges just in case agents and are neighbors. Since the relationships between neighbors can change over time, so can the graph which describes them. To account for this we will need to consider all possible such graphs. In the sequel we use the symbol to denote a suitably defined set, indexing the class of all simple graphs defined on vertices. The set of agent heading update rules defined by (1) and (2), can be written in state form. Toward this end, for each , define",

A complete description of this system would have to include a model which explains how changes over time as a function of the positions of the agents in the plane. While such a model is easy to derive and is essential for simulation purposes, it would be difficult to take into account in a convergence analysis. To avoid this difficulty, we shall adopt a more conservative approach which ignores how depends on the agent positions in the plane and assumes instead that might be any switching signal in some suitably defined set of interest.",
               "Our goal is to show for a large class of switching signals and for any initial set of agent headings that the headings of all agents will converge to the same steady state value . Convergence of the to is equivalent to the state vector converging to a vector of the form where . Naturally, there are situations where convergence to a common heading cannot occur. The most obvious of these is when one agent-say the th-starts so far away from the rest that it never acquires any neighbors. Mathematically, this would mean not only that is never  at any time , but also that vertex remains an isolated vertex of for all . This situation is likely to be encountered if is very small. At the other extreme, which is likely if is very large, all agents might remain neighbors of all others for all time. In this case, would remain fixed along such a trajectory at that value in for which is a complete graph. Convergence of to can easily be established in this special case because with so fixed, (4) is a linear, time-invariant, discrete-time system. The situation of perhaps the greatest interest is between these two extremes when is not necessarily complete or even connected for any , but when no strictly proper subset of 's vertices is isolated from the rest for all time. Establishing convergence in this case is challenging because changes with time and is not time-invariant. It is this case which we intend to study. Toward this end, we denote by the subset of consisting of the indices of the connected graphs in . Our first result establishes the convergence of for the case when takes values only in .

It is possible to establish convergence to a common heading under conditions which are significantly less stringent that those assumed in Theorem 1. To do this we need to introduce several concepts. By the union of a collection of simple graphs, , each with vertex set , is meant the simple graph with vertex set and edge set equaling the union of the edge sets of all of the graphs in the collection. We say that such a collection is jointly connected if the union of its members is a connected graph. Note that if such a collection contains at least one graph which is connected, then the collection must be jointly connected. On the other hand, a collection can be jointly connected even if none of its members are connected.",
               "It is natural to say that the agents under consideration are linked together across a time interval if the collection of graph encountered along the interval, is jointly connected. Theorem 1 says, in essence, that convergence of all agents' headings to a common heading is for certain provided all agents are linked together across each successive interval of length one (i.e., all of the time). Of course there is no guarantee that along a specific trajectory the agents will be so linked. Perhaps a more likely situation, at least when is not too small, is when the agents are linked together across contiguous intervals of arbitrary but finite length. If the lengths of such intervals are uniformly bounded, then in this case too convergence to a common heading proves to be for certain. A simple graph with vertex set V = f1; 2; . . . ; ng and edge set E is connected if has a \"path\" between each distinct pair of its vertices i and j where by a path (of length m) between vertices i and j is meant a sequence of distinct edges of of the form (i; k ); (k ; k ); . . .

Whether or not this is true remains to be seen.",

Such and are examples of \"primitive matrices\" where by a primitive matrix is meant any square, nonnegative matrix for which is a matrix with all positive entries for sufficiently large . It is known that among the eigenvalues of a primitive matrix, there is exactly one with largest magnitude, that this eigenvalue is the only one possessing an eigenvector with all positive entries, and that the remaining eigenvalues are all strictly smaller in magnitude than the largest one. This means that for , 1 must be 's largest eigenvalue and all remaining eigenvalues must lie within the open unit circle. As a consequence, each such must have the property that for some row vector . Any stochastic matrices for which is a matrix of rank 1 is called ergodic . Primitive stochastic matrices are thus ergodic matrices.

First, we point out that the class of stochastic matrices with positive diagonal elements is closed under matrix multiplication. This is because the product of two nonnegative matrices with positive diagonals is a matrix with the same properties and because the product of two stochastic matrices is stochastic. Second, we will use the following key result. Lemma 1: Let be a set of indices in for which is a jointly connected collection of graphs. Then the matrix product is ergodic."

While latter is much easier to analyze than the former, it has the disadvantage of not being a true decentralized control because each agent must know an upper bound (i.e., ) on the total number of agents within the group. Whether or not this is really a disadvantage, of course depends on what the models are to be used for.",

Since all matrices in (35) are positive semidefinite, any vector which makes the quadratic form vanish, must also make the quadratic form vanish. Since any vector in the kernel of each matrix has this property, we can draw the following conclusion: kernel span In this section, we consider a modified version of Vicsek's discrete-time system consisting of the same group of agents as before, plus one additional agent, labeled 0, which acts as the group's leader. Agent 0 moves at the same constant speed as its followers but with a fixed heading . The th follower updates its heading just as before, using the average of its own heading plus the headings of its neighbors. The difference now is that each follower's set of neighbors can include the leader and does so whenever the leader is within the follower's neighborhood defining circle of radius . Agent 's update rule, thus, is of the form where as before, is the set of labels of agent 's neighbors from the original group of followers, and is the number of labels within .

               "The theorems in this paper all provide convergence results for rich classes of switching signals and arbitrary initial heading vectors. Of course as soon as one elects to interpret these results in the context of heading models for mobile autonomous agents, one needs to add qualifications, because the actual switching signal generated along a particular model's trajectory would have to depend on the model's initial heading vector. To make such a dependence explicit (and to run meaningful simulations) more complete models would have to be defined. In carrying out this step, one can expect to obtain a variety of results. For example, with very large agent sensing regions (i.e., very large) and agents initially near each other, one would expect enough connectivity along resultant trajectories for convergence to a common heading to occur. On the other hand, with widely distributed initial agent positions and very small, one would expect to see a bifurcation of the group into distinct subgroups with different steady state headings. In other words, a complete deterministic understanding of the flocking problems we've considered would require both more complete agent motion models as well as an understanding of the nonlinear feedback process upon which actually would depend. An alternative probabilistic approach might enable one to circumvent or at least simplify the analysis of the feedback process.",

Of course before this can happen many compelling issues such as collision avoidance, and the effects of disturbances, noise, sensing errors, vehicle modeling errors, etc. would have to be satisfactorily addressed. For example, the collision avoidance question might also be approached by replacing the point models implicitly used in this paper, with the model of a bumper-like \"virtual shell\" within which each agent vehicle is constrained to remain .",
               "While the analysis in this paper is deterministic and does not address the noise issue, the results obtained suggest that to understand the effect of additive noise, one should focus on how noise inputs effect connectivity of the associated neighbor graphs. Simulation results presented in indicate that when noise intensity in the system is fixed, there is a phase transition as the density of the agents is increased, i.e., there is a critical density after which all agents eventually become aligned. It is possible that this phenomenon can be adequately explained using percolation theory of random graphs .",
               "The results of this paper have been extended to the case where there are inter-agent forces due to attraction, repulsion and alignment . The new results indicate that the convergence arguments used in this paper also apply to the more general problem considered in under similar assumptions regarding the connectivity of the graph representing the nearest neighbor relationships.",
               "The convergence proof for Vicsek's model presented in Section II relies heavily on Wolfowitz's theorem. By generalizing some of the constructions Wolfowitz used in his proof, it is possible to develop a convergence result for a continuous-time analog of the Vicsek model which is quite similar to Theorem 5.",
               "In studying continuous-time leader-following, we imposed the requirement that all followers use the same dwell time. This is not really necessary. In particular, without much additional effort it can be shown that Theorem 5 remains true under the relatively mild assumption that all agents use dwell times which are rationally related. In contrast, the synchronization assumption may be more difficult to relax. Although convergence is still likely without synchronization, the aperiodic nature of 's switching times which could result, make the analysis problem more challenging.",
               "The use of simply averaging rules such as those discussed in this paper can sometimes have counter-intuitive consequences which may be undesirable in some applications. For example the average of headings 0.01 and is so this might cause two agents with headings both close to 0, to both approximately reverse direction to a heading of on the next step. It would be of interest to determine how update rules might be modified to avoid this type of behavior. Of course issues along these lines would not arise at all if the systems we've considered were modeling other physically significant variables such as agent speed or temperature where one could take all of rather than just as the set in which the take values. The models we have analyzed are of course very simple and as a consequence, they are probably not really descriptive of actual bird-flocking, fish schooling, or even the coordinated movements of envisioned groups of mobile robots. Nonetheless, these models do seem to exhibit some of the rudimentary behaviors of large groups of mobile autonomous agents and for this reason they serve as a natural starting point for the analytical study of more realistic models. It is clear from the developments in this paper, that ideas from graph theory and dynamical system theory will play a central role in both the analysis of such biologically inspired models and in the synthesis of provably correct distributed control laws which produce such emergent behaviors in man-made systems.",
