Fortunately, recommendation systems technology offers a potential solution to this problem. Nowadays, recommendation systems have become an important research area and there has been much work done both in industryand academia on developing new approaches to recommender systems over the last decade.",

Collaborative filtering system overcomes some limitations of content-based filtering. The system can suggest items (the things to be recommended, such as books, music etc.) to users and recommendations are based on the ratings of items, instead of the contents of the items, which can improve the quality of recommendations. Although collaborative filtering can improve the quality of recommendations based on the user ratings, it completely denies any information that can be extracted from contents. 3.",

It is obvious that the content-based filtering does not suffer the above problems. So it is a natural way to combine them in order to achieve a better performance of filtering, and take the advantages of each. In present recommender system, users receive items on the basis of the ratings they have already provided. When a new user connects to the system, his/her list of ratings is empty, which makes it difficult for the system to provide recommendations. This problem is one of the well-know cold start problems, called new-user problem .",
