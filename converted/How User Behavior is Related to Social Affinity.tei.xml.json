               "Keywords Previous research has suggested that people who are in the same social circle exhibit similar behaviors and tastes. The rise of social networks gives us insights into the social circles of web users, and recommendation services (including search engines, advertisement engines, and collaborative filtering engines) provide a motivation to adapt recommendations to the interests of the audience. An important primitive for supporting these applications is the ability to quantify how connected two users are in a social network. The shortest-path distance between a pair of users is an obvious candidate measure. This paper introduces a new measure of \"affinity\" in social networks that takes into account not only the distance between two users, but also the number of edge-disjoint paths between them, i.e. the \"robustness\" of their connection. Our measure is based on a sketch-based approach, and affinity queries can be answered extremely efficiently (at the expense of a one-time offline sketch computation). We compare this affinity measure against the \"approximate shortest-path distance\", a sketch-based distance measure with similar efficiency characteristics. Our empirical study is based on a Hotmail email exchange graph combined with demographic information and Bing query history , and a Twitter mention-graph together with the text of the underlying tweets. We found that users who are close to each other-either in terms of distance or affinity-have a higher similarity in terms of demographics, queries, and tweets."

For example, if 50% of the edges are removed randomly, then it is reasonable to conclude that pairs of nodes remaining in the same connected component have a higher affinity than the ones that got separated. If there is only one path of a certain length between a pair it is less likely to survive sampling as compared to a case when there are many paths of that length. Also, longer paths are less likely to survive than shorter paths. Thus, our measure accounts for both length and breadth of the set of paths. We formalize this intuition below.",

The mode of the distribution is at distance 10, and the bulk is between 5 and 15. It should be pointed out that in earlier work we found ASP to overestimate distance by a constant additive amount (about 2 to 3 in the case of undirected web graphs), so we assume the distribution of true distances to be shifted accordingly. shows the distribution of Aaffinity values (for= 0.5) of the sketches for the graph with unweighted edges. The mode of the distribution is at 0.82. Given that the sampling probability vector p1,, pr was calibrated to produce a uniform distribution of affinity values across the entire set of 312 million users in the email exchange graph, the non-uniformity of the distribution in indicates that our set of candidate users is biased towards users with affinity towards each other. shows the fraction of pairs of users (drawn from the candidate set) residing in the same country, as a function of the distance and affinity between the pair of users. The vertical axis shows the fraction of pairs coming from the same country; the bottom scale of the horizontal axis shows ASP distance values (in increasing order) whose distribution is plotted by the blue curve; the top scale shows the estimated Aaffinity values (in decreasing order, for= 0.5 and based on the sketches formed using unweighted edges) whose distribution is plotted by the red curve. Each (x, y) point of a curve shows the fraction y of all pairs at distance/affinity x who reside in the same country. In order to reduce noise, we restricted the curves to only those distance and affinity values with at least 1000 (out of 5 million) pairs of users. Both distance and affinity measures are discrete, but since the set of possible distance values is smaller than the set of possible affinity values, the affinity curve appears smoother. The ASP curve is far more slanted than the affinity curve, suggesting that the correlation between ASP and country of residence is far stronger than between affinity and country. Indeed, this is borne out by the correlation coefficients shown in . shows the fraction of pairs of users speaking the same language, using the same encoding as the previous figure. Again, we restricted the curve to points with at least 1000 pairs of users. As in the previous figure, the ASP curve is far more slanted than the affinity curve, suggesting stronger correlation between distance and language than between affinity and language. This is also borne out by the correlation coefficients in the second row of . shows the age difference between pairs of users as a function of the distance and affinity between the pair of users. The vertical axis plots the age difference, the horizontal axis plots distance and affinity as it did in Figures 6 and 7. Each (x, y) point of a curve shows the average age difference y of all pairs at distance/affinity x. Again, the curve only shows points with at least 1000 pairs of users so as to reduce noise. The graph has several features worth pointing out: First, note that the vertical axis does not start at 0, but rather at 14 years -the average age difference between pairs of users is ranges between about 15 and 18 years regardless of distance or affinity. Putting it differently, email is a social medium that connects generations. Second, age difference and affinity are negatively correlated -users with high affinity are on average closer in age. Third, the distance curve is non-monotonic -there is no clear relationship between the ASP distance of two users in the email graph and their age difference. Referring to the third row of , the correlation coefficients of ASP distance and age vs. affinity and age are quite low and fairly close to each other, with ASP having a slight edge."

Next, we examine whether the distance or affinity between two users is predictive of shared interests.",

Each (x, y) point of a curve shows the average similarity y of all pairs at distance/affinity x.

This is also borne out by the correlation coefficients in the fourth row of . shows the correlation coefficient between user demographic and interest profiles and the different types of social proximity measures we are considering in this study. In addition to the approximate shortest path distance, we are considering six different variants of the affinity measure: A(for= 0.5) and A, computed on the email exchange graph with unweighted edges, edges weighted (and sampled) by the number of reciprocal email exchanges, and edges weighted by the logarithm of that number. Consistent with , we find that the correlation coefficients of the ASP measure are higher than those of Aand A for all user characteristics. The weighted versions of affinity also have a higher correlation than the unweighted ones for all characteristics except age. This might indicate that age changes differently over the network than language or country. Language and country probably change over long distances, whereas age per- : Statistical significance of the correlations: Ratio of correlation for the same pair to correlation for random pairs.",

This could be an indication that the unweighted variants of affinity are better measures to capture \"small\" social distances whereas ASP is better for \"large\" social distances. This is consistent with our earlier observation that ASP has a higher percentage error on shorter distances .",
               "It is an open question of how well precise shortest-path distance would perform; unfortunately we do not know how to perform five million precise shortest-path computations within a reasonable time frame.",
               "While it may seem that the correlation coefficients in Table 1 are small, we show that they are much higher than the values we would expect if the properties were completely uncorrelated. In , we compare the correlation coefficients computed in to the correlation coefficients between the same properties for two independently chosen sequences of 5 million pairs. For example, to compute the correlation coefficient between affinity and cosine similarity (CA,cs), we computed it between the vector of cosine similarities and affinities on the same set of 5 million pairs. Now we compute it between the vector of cosine similarities for one random set of pairs and vector of affinities for another random set of pairs (C r A,cs ). We compute the ratio |CA,cs|/|C r A,cs |. If this ratio is high it means that the values of affinity and cosine similarities for the same pair are much more correlated than for two random pairs. shows this ratio for the different pairs of properties. As can be seen, the ratio is about 7 to 16 for the affinity variants and about 13 to 80 for the ASP measure, which means that the statistical significance of the correlations is not negligible."

               "Our second experiment is based on one month worth of Twitter postings (tweets), 1,475,522,405 in total. Twitter is a popular micro-blogging service that allows users to post messages up to 140 characters in length. The Twitter community follows a number of stylistic conventions when composing tweets, one of them the convention of mentioning other Twitter users by prefixing their Twitter user IDs with the @ character. A single mention in itself does not indicate a social connection between the mentioner and the mentioned, but we assert that if two users mutually mention each other, a social bond does indeed exist.",
               "We first ran an initial data extraction process on our collection of tweets that identified all pairs of (distinct) users mutually mentioning each other at least once during August 2011, and extracted all tweets (whether containing mentions or not) authored by these users. This extracted 1,265,660,845 tweets authored by 10,410,144 users.",
               "Next, we constructed the mention-graph using the following process: First, we constructed an intermediate weighted directed graph containing a vertex for each user whose tweets we extracted during the data extraction phase, and an edge (u, v) with weight w if user u mentioning user v a total of w times. Next, we constructed the actual mention graph, an undirected weighted graph, by taking the vertex set of the directed graph, and introducing an edge between u and v with weight mean(w1, w2) if the directed graph contained an edge (u, v) with positive weight w1 and an edge (v, u) with positive weight w2. We constructed one variant of the mention graph using the arithmetic mean of weights, and another variant using the geometric mean. The mention-graph contained 10,410,144 vertices and 176,551,621 edges.",

We also computed the cosine similarity between the tf-idf vectors of the collected tweets of each pair of users, and we computed correlation coefficients between the graphbased measures and the text-based ground truth. 880,564 of the 5,000,000 pairs (or 17.6% of all sampled pairs) were in separate connected components of the mention-graph, with no path between them.

               "In computing affinity values and ASP distances, we experimented with different transform functions for edge weights. In the case of affinity, where heavier edges are more likely to be included in Gp and thus denote closeness, we tried the constant transform T (w) = 1 (effectively ignoring weights), the identity transform T (w) = w (directly using the mean of the mention frequency), and the logarithmic transform T (w) = log w (discounting excessive \"mutual admiration\"). In the case of ASP distance, where edge weight denote social distance, we tried the constant transform T (w) = 1 (effectively ignoring weights), the reciprocal transform T (w) = 1 w , and the reciprocal logarithmic transform T (w) = 1 log w . shows the distribution of ASP distances computed using the constant edge weight transform (i.e. an unweighted graph); shows the distribution of Aaffinity values (for= 0.5) of the sketches for the graph with unweighted edges.

Each (x, y) point of a curve shows the average similarity y of all pairs at distance/affinity x. Unlike what we observed for the Hotmail graph, the affinity curve is more slanted than the ASP curve, suggesting stronger correlation between affinity and tweet similarity than between distance and tweet similarity. This is also borne out by the correlation coefficients in . The table shows correlation coefficients between textual cosine similarity (our ground truth) and different variants of our graph-distance measures. Specifically, it explores the impact of using an arithmetic vs. a geometric mean when combining edge weights during the mapping from a directed to an undirected graph; the impact of multiple edge weight transforms; and of course the distance measure itself -negated ASP distance, Aaffinity, and A affinity.

               "In this paper, we introduced \"social affinity\" as a new measure of how robustly two users are connected within a social network. Intuitively, affinity captures how robust the connection between a pair of users is to random deletion of edges in the graph. The affinity value can be efficiently estimated through a sketch-based algorithm, which requires only two table lookups to retrieve the sketch for each user, plus a simple computation on the pair of sketches. We compare this new affinity measure against \"approximate shortest path\" distance, another sketch-based measure estimating the shortest-path distance between two nodes in a graph. We evaluated our measure on two social graphs. First, we used a sampling of the Hotmail email exchange graph as our social network, and user profiles and query history as independent measures of user similarity. We found that both ASP distance and social affinity between two users are correlated to their profile and query similarity. While ASP had a higher correlation for most user properties, affinity was better in one that changes over short distances. This suggests that the affinity measure may be better-suited for capturing short-distance effects in a social graph, whereas ASP may be preferable for capturing long-distance effects. Second, we constructed a Twitter mention graph from one month worth of tweets, and the collection of tweets written by a given user as the ground truth. We found that the textual similarity between two users' tweets was strongly correlated to their affinity, and somewhat more weakly correlated to their approximate distance in the mention-graph.",
               "We hypothesize that some of the weaknesses we observed for ASP are due to the fact that ASP is an approximation of the true distance. We are still investigating whether it is reasonably feasible to compute precise shortest path distances for the five million pairs we used to compare our measures."
