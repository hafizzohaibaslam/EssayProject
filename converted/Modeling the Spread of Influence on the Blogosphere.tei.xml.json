               "Blogs have become a means by which new ideas and information spreads rapidly on the web. They often discuss the lat-est trends and echo with reactions to different events in the world. The collective wisdom present on the blogosphere is invaluable for market researchers and companies launching new products. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of some of the influence models on the blogosphere. We also examine the robustness of different heuristics in the presence of splogs or spam blogs. Experiments show PageRank based heuristics could be used to select an influential set of blog-gers such that we could maximize the spread of information on the blogosphere. influential blogs which are likely to be able to spread an idea most effectively. We also experiment with simpler heuristics such as PageRank which could be used to efficiently approximate the greedy algorithm for this problem. In this work we also highlight the importance of splog removal and discuss some of its implications on influence models. The paper is organized as follows: Section 1 gives background of the related research in this area and section 2.1 discusses the basic diffusion model as adapted from the related work. Section 2.3 provide some results of different heuristics explored and section 3.4 talks about the broader implications on the blogosphere. Finally we conclude in section 4 and describe some of the future work in this area."

As described in this model applies well in the blogosphere where a blogger may have a certain level of interest in a topic and is thus susceptible to talking about it. By discussing the topic he/she may infect others and over time might recover. The authors use this approach in characterizing individuals into various phases of a topic in which they are more likely to become infected. They model individual propagation and use an expectation maximization algorithm to predict the likelihood of a blogger linking to another blogger. They also study the different types of topics present in the dataset and describe an approach to categorize topics into subtopics. Certain topics are more infectious than others and spread through the social network of bloggers. Automatically predicting such topics and developing models to accurately identify the propagation patterns on the blogosphere is the main focus of this work.",

In this scheme, each directed edge is assigned a weight Wij = w(?dij) where ?d refers to the time difference between the blogs citing a URL and w(?) is the weight function that gives importance to URL citations which are closer in time. The edge weights are then normalized and PageRank computation follows. This weighted graph is called the implicit information flow graph. iRank makes use of the temporal nature of blogs by differentially weighing each citation in the graph by the time difference between when the blog mentions a URL and how soon it is referenced by other blogs. In our work we only use the PageRank computation and will investigate and compare iRank in future studies.",

We use the basic Linear Threshold Model as proposed by Kempe et al. The influence model is described in Section 2.1. While the original models were validated on citation graphs, which are much smaller, we apply these algorithms on graphs derived from links between blogs. The citation graphs tend to be much cleaner and some of the techniques proposed do not apply well in the presence of splogs.

Splogs are identified using supervised learning with Support Vector Machines as described in . shows the distribution of the splogs in the top results as ranked by PageRank, HITS and the Indegree heuristic. From this graph we can observe that the indegree and HITS based heuristics were subject to being easily spammed. As described in the HITS algorithm is susceptible to spamming and this is particularly true in the presence of Tightly Knit Communities (TKC). This phenomenon was originally proposed by and also studied by . Other variations of the HITS algorithm attempt to solve this problem, however it was interesting to note that this issue, though it may have already been seen in the case of web spam, is also true for the blog domain. However, PageRank was found to be relatively resilient to splogs.",

The Greedy heuristic of node selection performs better than both PageRank or indegree. However one of the disadvantages of the greedy approach is that it is computationally quite expensive. PageRank on the other hand is an iterative algorithm that converges to the principal eigenvector of the adjacency matrix. While it is faster to compute, it requires knowledge of the structure of links which might emerge only after the blogpost has been read and linked to by other blogs over a period of time."

Although less often, there are links from blogs to splog pages. One explanation for these is that it could be due to comment spam, however this would require further investigation.

A post in the former is not likely to be very effective at influencing opinions on political issues even though Engadget is one of the most popular blogs on the Web. For topics of interest to a narrow community of people, a relatively low ranking blog might be very influential. The blog Lambda the Ultimate, for example, is thought to be very influential with respect to programming languages. Categorizing blogs by topics can be done in a variety of ways including using a reference topic hierarchy (e.g., Yahoo's), an ontology (e.g., Wordnet) or a combination of user defined and assigned tags. It is also possible to develop a model that predicts a persons interest, e.g., expressing the probability that a person will be interested in topic X if they are interested in topic Y).",
               "A second issue involves introducing notions of the current beliefs, opinions and sentiments of blogs and other Web sites with respect to a given topic, concept or object. This can be important in two ways. The first is to modify the influence graph to associate a sentiment to each link. Many blogs might link to blog B expressing strong negative opinions about topic T and few blogs might link to B with positive opinions on T. In such cases, it's unlikely that information on topic T posted on B will have a positive impact. The second way that this can be important is to avoid \"preaching to the choir\". Getting iloveipods.com to post positive information about ipods may not have a big effect. Although the site influences a large community, most of its members are already ipod fanatics. Finally, the Blogosphere is quite dynamic, with blogs coming into and going out of existence regularly and their popularity rising and falling, sometimes rapidly. Current heuristics generally tend to be biased towards the already popular blogs. It is quite possible that if an obscure site with a low PageRank was to put an interesting meme it would suddenly be popular amongst most bloggers. Developing influence models that could take this temporal nature into consideration could identify blogs that are upcoming and rising in popularity."
