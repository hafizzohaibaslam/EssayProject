Telling a fact corresponds to reporting on that knowledge base; querying corresponds to the sending agent's attempt to extract something from the receiving agent's knowledge base.",

Again, the primitives are all assertives or directives, but unlike KQML they can be composed. Arcol has a formal semantics, which presupposes that agents have beliefs and intentions, and can represent their uncertainty about various facts. Arcol gives performance conditions, which define when an agent may perform a specific communication. For example, in Arcol, agent Avi can tell agent Bob something only if Avi believes it also and can establish that Bob does not believe it. Arcol's performance conditions thus require the agents to reason about each other's beliefs and intentions and behave cooperatively and sincerely.",

The newer versions of the standard also discuss interaction protocols-a more promising line of thought. The FIPA standard also uses Lisp-like syntactic conventions similar to KQML's. For most purposes, however, the current FIPA standard can be treated the same as Arcol. . ing perspective, type of meaning, basis (semantics or pragmatics), context, and coverage (the number of communicative acts included). shows the elements in this dimension.

For example, instead of hardwiring a specific behavior into the agents, multiagent system designers might have the agents negotiate with one another to determine the best course of action for that situation.

However, designers also know ahead of time the precise differences among dialects, and can expect their agents to communicate successfully with agents from other societies only to the extent that their dialects agree. Dialects of this variety enable the context sensitivity that is essential to building significant applications. Such dialects are good. The problem with traditional approaches is not the use of dialects per se, but that the dialects are arbitrary and cannot be adequately formalized in the chosen framework.",
               "We envision the design and establishment of societies as essentially a community effort, much like Internet evolution. Protocols will spread much like the proliferation of network protocols, markup languages, and e-mail data formats: When enough vendors support a protocol, it will become a worthwhile target for other vendors.",
               "The challenge thus becomes finding an approach that is normative at the society level and preserves some of the intuitions behind the high-level abstractions such as beliefs and intentions. Such an approach would provide a canonical form of protocols and a canonical definition for the different communicative acts. There are two obvious solutions. The first is to have a purely behavior-based approach, but this may limit the ability to describe complex agent states. The second is to have a purely mentalist approach, which as I have described, reduces agent design autonomy and is inherently noncanonical.",

               "When agents from different vendors-or even different research projects-attempt to parse each other's messages, they cannot understand them correctly. This happens for two reasons. First, the receiving agent may not recognize the applicationspecific terms the sending agent is using to communicate. Second-and perhaps more importanteven basic communication components are not uniformly understood. Both these problems stem from differing interpretations of key concepts, and the result is the evolution of multiple dialects within a language.",
               "Idiolects-a variant of a language specific to one agent-result when the language emphasizes private perspective and personal meaning, as described in the main text. When only the private perspective is considered, an agent can produce or interpret messages as it unilaterally sees fit. Such an agent follows the philosophy of Lewis Carroll's Humpty Dumpty: Words mean exactly what I want them to. And communicating agents suffer the same problem as Alice, who failed to understand much of what Humpty Dumpty said. tal states. This approach, which I originated and am currently investigating, 5 defines when an agent's communicative act would be wholeheartedly satisfied. For example, assertives are satisfied if the world matches what they describe. Directives are satisfied when the receiver acts to ensure their success-and has the required intentions and know-how. Commissives are satisfied when the sender acts to ensure their success. This approach is thus a hybrid: Although it takes some steps toward a coarse canonical set of objective definitions, it does not uniquely ascribe beliefs and intentions to agents. However, designers can use it to construct agents that would keep their public commitments. A lthough all the fundamental issues in agent communication are far from resolved, my advice to people attempting to build multiagent systems is not to lose heart. Only through experience can some of these key questions be resolved. I have two recommendations. First, reflect on the issues this article raises as they affect a particular ACL or its implementation:"
