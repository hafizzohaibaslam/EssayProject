               "Mathematical modeling of innovation diffusion has attracted strong academic interest since the early 1960s. Traditional diffusion models have aimed at empirical generalizations and hence describe the spread of new products parsimoniously at the market level. More recently, agent-based modeling and simulation has increasingly been adopted since it operates on the individual level and, thus, can capture complex emergent phenomena highly relevant in diffusion research. Agent-based methods have been applied in this context both as intuition aids that facilitate theory-building and as tools to analyze real-world scenarios, support management decisions and obtain policy recommendations. This review addresses both streams of research. We critically examine the strengths and limitations of agent-based modeling in the context of innovation diffusion, discuss new insights agent-based models have provided, and outline promising opportunities for future research. The target audience of the paper includes both researchers in marketing interested in new findings from the agent-based modeling literature and researchers who intend to implement agent-based models for their own research endeavors. Accordingly, we also cover pivotal modeling aspects in 123 184 E. Kiesling et al. depth (concerning, e.g., consumer adoption behavior and social influence) and outline existing models in sufficient detail to provide a proper entry point for researchers new to the field."

               "Management practitioners also show considerable interest in diffusion models because firms' ability to successfully market innovations determines whether they can create competitive advantage and secure long-term success. Managers can therefore benefit considerably from tools that help them to pre-estimate the market response to new products, provide model-based decision-support, and allow them to assess new product introduction strategies.",
               "Aggregate models such as the Bass model, which provides an empirical generalization based on a differential equation formulation, provide such support only to a limited degree, as they are not designed for what-if type questions. Furthermore, these models do not explicitly consider consumers' heterogeneity and the complex dynamics of social processes that shape the diffusion and can therefore tackle only a limited set of theoretical issues. Aggregate models have also been criticized for a lack of predictive and explanatory power.",

This trend is in line with a broader development in the social sciences (cf. the overview provided by . One reason why the use of this bottom-up methodology has gained momentum in recent years lies in its ability to model complex emergent phenomena-such as the diffusion of an innovation in a socio-economic system-that more traditional modeling approaches cannot capture easily. In agent-based diffusion models, the atomic model element is not the social system as a whole, but the individual consumer, or agent. Consumers' heterogeneity, their social interactions, and their decision making processes can be modeled explicitly. The macro-level dynamics of the social system emerge dynamically from the aggregated individual behavior and the interactions between agents.",

The second stream, which has experienced significant growth in recent years, is concerned with the practical application of ABMs to provide forecasts, decision support, and policy analyses for specific applications based on empirical data.",

A number of reviews have addressed related aspects: outlines (potential) uses of ABMs in innovation/new product development research, reviews agent-based computational economics models of innovation and technological change, broadly review diffusion modeling efforts, and summarize research on innovation from a marketing perspective. The literature on ABMs of innovation diffusion, however, has not been reviewed so far and the purpose of the current paper is to fill this gap.",

               "Although diffusion modeling has become a vibrant research tradition, most reported work has consisted of refinements and extensions of the Bass diffusion model without alteration of its basic premise ( ). Most models therefore still show the structure of the basic epidemic model introduced by Bass, which we outline in the following.",
               "Following diffusion of innovations theory, Bass characterizes the diffusion of an innovation as a contagious process driven by external influence (e.g. advertising, mass media) and internal influence (e.g. word-of-mouth). More precisely, Bass specifies that an individual's probability of adopting a new product at time t, given she/he has not adopted yet, depends linearly on two influences: one that is not related to previous adopters and is represented by the parameter of external influence denoted as p, and an influence that is related to the number of previous adopters, represented by the parameter of internal influence denoted as q ( ). Based on these parameters, the limiting probability that an actor who has not adopted yet at time t does so at time t +t (t0) is described by the hazard model",
               "where f (t) is the probability of adoption at time t, F(t) is the cumulative distribution function of adoptions at time t, and p as well as q are parameters. Aggregate models are primarily concerned with modeling n(t), the flow of consumers from the potential market M to the current market . Equation 1 is therefore typically used in the following reexpressed form: q = 0.3 q = 0.4 q = 0.5 ",
               "where N (t) is the number of consumers having adopted by time t. Plotting n(t) over time yields a (skewed) bell-curve of new adoptions, whereas plotting N (t) yields the typical S-shaped cumulative adoption curve. illustrates various diffusion curves for typical values of p and q ( report that the average value of p = 0.03 and the average value of q = 0.38). Based on this original formulation, a number of efforts have been made to extend and refine the Bass framework to reflect the complexity of new product growth. One of the advantages of this modeling paradigm is that it provides a parsimonious and analytically tractable way to look at the whole market and interpret its behavior. A related advantage is that these models make use of market level data to forecast sales, which is typically more readily available than individual-level data. Assuming that sufficient data points are available, the model can be fitted to early sales data to obtain parameter estimates for new products. For the Bass model, the well-researched estimation literature covers a number of estimation methods, including ordinary least squares , maximum likelihood ( , nonlinear least squares and genetic algorithms ( ). The Bass model fits many historic data on completed diffusion processes well (cf. and is excellent at backcasting. However, several limitations of aggregate-level models in general, and the Bass model in particular, have been identified in the literature.",
               "Predictive power A number of authors have raised concerns over the reliability of parameter estimates (cf., e.g., Van den Bulte and Lilien 1997) and over the use of the Bass model for forecasting purposes (e.g. ). note that \"parameter estimation for diffusion models is primarily of historic interest; by the time sufficient observations have developed for reliable estimation, it is too late to use the estimates for forecasting purposes\". Because the models need data at both turning points (takeoff prior to growth and slowdown prior to maturity) to provide stable estimates , there is little use for them before or around takeoff , which is the time these forecasts are most valuable. In other words, traditional diffusion models require as input information about the events (takeoff and slowdown) that managers would like to predict .",
               "Explanatory power Traditional aggregate models are not behaviorally based . It is therefore not surprising that these models do not reproduce the complexity of real-world diffusion patterns. Innovation failures, oscillations, and collapses of initially successful diffusions are phenomena observed in reality, but not explained by aggregate diffusion models ( . Also, while the two coefficients of Bass-type models have appealing interpretations (internal and external influence, respectively), it is not clear whether they truly reflect the underlying diffusion mechanisms. therefore refer to these models as \"phenomenological\" and thus underline that they provide empirical generalizations and do not aim to explain the mechanisms that cause diffusion processes. This can be linked to a more general widespread neglect of process in the social sciences, as criticized by Chattoe, who notes that \"collection of aggregate time series data does little to explain social change even when statistical regularities can be established\" .",
               "Population heterogeneity The mathematical form of the Bass model requires the assumption that the potential adopter population is homogeneous ( ; Van den Bulte and Stremersch 2004), which may be considered a gross simplification since potential adopters are typically heterogeneous in economic factors such as income, in their individual preferences, the information they have etc., and consequently in their propensity to adopt. The heterogeneous population argument was already used by , who defined five adopter categories based on propensity to adopt. For a discussion of the debate between two alternative explanations for diffusion processes, viz. individual heterogeneity on the one hand, and awareness and information spreading mechanisms on the other hand, we refer to .",
               "To consider heterogeneity in traditional diffusion models, compartmental approaches were developed that aggregate the population into a relatively small number of states such as unaware, aware, in the market, adopters etc. (e.g., ). However, compartment models still assume homogeneity and perfect mix-ing within compartments and do not consider heterogeneity in individual attributes and in the network structure of interactions . For the Bass model, efforts to explain changes in parameter estimates due to underlying heterogeneity of the population were also made (e.g. . Nevertheless, the fundamental issue that Bass-type models are not sufficient for hypothesis testing about the process that drives adoption behavior remains, since aggregate fit of models based on different theoretical assumptions (e.g., heterogeneity vs. information spreading mechanisms) are often indistinguishable .",
               "Social processes Due to the parsimonious structure of aggregate models, it is also not possible to distinguish effects of different social processes on diffusion. In the Bass model, for example, the internal influence parameter p is often interpreted as word-ofmouth (hereafter WoM). However, it can also capture imitation effects such as social learning, social pressures, or network effects (Van den Bulte and Stremersch 2004). Furthermore, Bass-type models make very specific assumptions about the structure of social interactions. The formulation implies a fully-connected social network in which everyone in the target population is directly connected to everyone else, and can potentially influence all others ( ). It also presumes that the influence of adopters on non-adopters is a linear function of the number of adopters throughout the diffusion periods (ibid.). Because of these simplifying assumptions, the coefficient of imitation cannot be expected to directly reflect the underlying social mechanisms that shape diffusion processes.",
               "Prescriptive guidance In their general typology of explicative models, Evered (1976) draw attention to \"the almost paradoxical contrast between the future-oriented nature of what practicing managers actually do, and the past-oriented nature of most of our scientific theories.\" Traditional diffusion models illustrate this contrast. Managers planning the introduction of a new product are interested in predicting the effects of the decision variables at their disposal, most notably the marketing mix factors product, price, promotion, and distribution, none of which were initially considered explicitly in early diffusion models. This issue has been recognized and various authors have included marketing mix variables into aggregate diffusion models in order to better describe reality and potentially provide directions for how to alter the diffusion process by manipulating those variables ). In particular, marketing mix variables considered include price ), distribution and supply restrictions , and promotion and advertising .",
               "Two basic approaches for incorporating these variables are (i) via a separable, or (ii) via a non-separable function ). The former specification assumes that marketing variables have a direct effect on sales, separate from the part that describes the diffusion process. The non-separable specification, by contrast, assumes that the marketing variables moderate the diffusion process, so that both parts cannot be separately included in the model. In the Bass model, marketing mix is typically incorporated by means of a non-separable function that makes p and/or q dependent on explanatory marketing variables, i.e., p(t) = f (marketing variables(t)) and/or q(t) = f (marketing variables(t)). In the former case, marketing variables affect the adoption decision via external influence, whereas in the latter case, they stimulate interpersonal communication. Some models also consider the effect of marketing on the size of the potential market (m). For a comprehensive review of marketing variables in macro-level diffusion models, we refer to .",
               "While traditional aggregate models that include marketing mix variables have become highly sophisticated, there appears to be no consensus on what marketing variables to include and in which part of the models to include them ). Furthermore, the incorporation of prices into models of innovation diffusion failed to significantly enhance the explanatory power of those models . As note in their 25 years review, it is also fair to say that in most of these contributions, the emphasis has still been on the explanation of past behavior rather than on forecasting future behavior. The general approach has thus remained more descriptive than normative ) and aggregate models still provide limited potential for policy (what-if) analyses.",

One of the first micro models of innovation diffusion was introduced by , who propose an analytic method to aggregate individual-level behavior based on specific heterogeneity assumptions. They consider perception of the innovation, personal preference, and the perceived reliability of information as individual-level determinants of adoption. They also provide a closed formulation of the interface between individual and aggregate level to link individual decision-making and aggregate dynamics. However, the analytical tractability of the model hinges on limited analysis of aggregated variables and consumer characteristics . The framework also cannot incorporate heterogeneity related to linkages in the social network ( ).",

               "ABMS differs fundamentally from both aggregate differential equation and aggregate simulation approaches such as system dynamics (cf. ). Unlike both, it is a bottom-up, disaggregate approach and thus not limited in its capacity to account for heterogeneity and social structure. The elementary modeling unit is not the (complex) system, but rather the individual. It has its roots in cellular automata modeling, which has a long tradition in the social sciences that goes back to at least seminal model of segregation dynamics. However, ABMs also differ from cellular automata in some important respects. First, cells in a cellular automaton are typically characterized by a single finite state variable; agents' state, interaction, internal processing, and behavior, by contrast, tends to be more complex. Second, the structure of local interactions in a cellular automaton model is typically based on a regular lattice; ABMs can be based on arbitrary local interaction structures. These and other differences notwithstanding, terminology in the literature is inconsistent and cellular models are frequently referred to as \"agent-based\". Since they also follow an individual-based approach, they fit within the scope of this review.",

It can be characterized as an autonomous decision-making entity that interacts with other agents and/or with its environment based upon a set of behavioral rules. Key characteristics of agents include autonomous behavior, interdependency, simple rules, and adaptive behavior (cf. .",
               "Finally, ABMs differ from differential equation models not only in terms of modeling granularity, but also fundamentally in how the results are obtained. Rather than describing the whole system directly and \"phenomenologically\", macro-scale dynamics in ABMs are emergent phenomena that arise from micro-level interactions between agents when the model is executed.",
               "To illustrate the contrast between these two approaches, we demonstrate that the Bass model is equivalent to a very specific agent-based model in which each of M homogeneous agents indexed by i = 1, . . . , M is in one of two states: potential adopter or adopter. We use a set of variables X = (x i , . . . , x M ){0, 1} to describe agents' adoption state (i.e., x i = 1 iff agent i has adopted).",
               "In the Bass model, each actor's probability to adopt at time t +t, given that it has not adopted by time t, is described by the hazard model in Equation 1. In the analogous agent-based formulation in discrete time, we can use agents' explicit state variable x i rather than the cumulative distribution function of adoptions F(t). The probability of agent i to transition from non-adopter to adopter state is then given as a function of the state of the system (X ) as follows:",
               "Like in the original Bass model, the probability of agent i to adopt, given that it has not adopted so far, depends linearly on an independent external influence p and an internal influence q that depends on the fraction of prior adopters. The formulation implies homogeneity and global interconnectedness, i.e., each agent's individual probability of adoption is influenced uniformly by the adoption state of all other agents. Obviously, f (X ) = 0 ? i for which x i = 1 and f (X )[0, 1] ? i for which x i = 0, i.e., all agent that already have adopted remain in the adopter state and all agents that have not adopted so far do so with the same probability in the current period.",

For this very special and simple stochastic model, the differential equation formulation of the Bass model provides an analytical solution. If agent-based models become only slightly more complicated, however, the equivalent system of differential equations can usually not be solved in closed form.",
               "Agent-based simulations allow modelers to overcome these limits of mathematical tractability. The bottom-up modeling approach can easily incorporate micro-level drivers of adoption, bounded rationality, imperfect information, and individuals' heterogeneity in terms of attributes, behavior, and linkages in the social network. ABMs of innovation diffusion are therefore more behaviorally based than aggregate models. In the spirit of modern complexity science, these models have the potential to explain complex non-linear diffusion patterns observed in the real world as the result of relatively simple local micro-level interactions."

They do not fit directly into classical economic thinking because homogeneous, perfectly rational individuals acting in a perfect market with complete information would always adopt at the same time. When we acknowledge that individuals are neither homogeneous, nor perfectly informed, (expected) utility is an obvious candidate concept for modeling adoption decisions, given that it constitutes a key building block of standard microeconomic theory of individual choice behavior. One could therefore expect utility theoretic approaches to feature prevalently in the literature. Surprisingly, however, the number of contributions that analyze innovation diffusion in a utilitarian framework is limited. Many of them use \"utility\" as an interpretive tag rather than explicitly modeling the choice between a single or multiple innovations and non-adoption (i.e., utility of highest alternative opportunity) by means of utility functions that represent individual preferences. , for example, formulate threshold functions for individual utility based on heterogeneous \"quality expectations\" and social utility components to obtain a utility aspiration level for each consumer agent. Conceptually, their approach does not differ fundamentally from other threshold models, apart from the interpretation of thresholds as \"utility aspiration levels\". In a similar vein, introduce a fixed individual utility component which is interpreted as a \"quality perception\" and formulate social utility, which they interpret as benefits due to network externalities, as a linear function of the proportion of adopters in the neighborhood.",

Whereas the Bass model formulation implies a fully-connected social network, ABMs may use more realistic interaction topologies that resemble real-world social networks.

This graph model is used prevalently in diffusion models and often serves as a baseline for comparisons with other network structures. The diameter of the resulting random graphs tends to be small, i.e., the largest number of links on the shortest path between any two nodes is small, which is a characteristic the generated graphs share with most real-world social networks ( . In reality, however, social networks tend to be highly clustered, which means that the probabilities of nodes being connected are not independent, but triadic closures are likely. More precisely, there are higher conditional probabilities that an arbitrary pair of nodes are linked, provided both are linked to a third node. In a social context, this means that networks tend to be \"cliquish\", i.e., A being linked to B as well as to C implies a strong likelihood that C is also linked to B.",

This corresponds to the notion that some people have a much larger number of acquaintances than others and serve as \"hubs\" in the network. More specifically, many (but not all) social networks exhibit the scale-freeness property, i.e., the probability P(k) that a node in the network is connected to k other nodes decays as a power law ( . A network model that captures this characteristic was proposed by . It starts with a few nodes linked to each other; nodes are added one by one and attached to existing nodes with probabilities according to the degree of the target node. Therefore, the more connected a node is, the more likely it is to receive new links. The resulting networks are scale-free, but typically not highly clustered. This algorithm is also used in several of the reviewed papers."

Results indicate that a limited subsidy policy can trigger diffusion that would otherwise not happen when reservation prices are heterogeneous, learning economies are in a certain range, and initial price levels are high. also model heterogeneous reservation prices, but draw them uniformly and independently. Agents adopt once the price falls below their reservation price, which is interpreted as a subjective \"individual valuation\". The authors also formulate an extended model in which these \"individual valuations\" are time-dependent. They explain the empirical finding of a delayed \"take-off\" of a new product by a drift of the percolation dynamics from a non-percolating regime to a percolating regime which occurs because the probability of buying increases over time with the cumulative number of buyers.

               "The effect of the structure of links in consumers' social network, through which awareness, information, and opinions about an innovation are spread, is one of the most intensively researched topics in the agent-based innovation diffusion literature. Advances in network modeling and the development of generative algorithms for small-world (Watts and Strogatz 1998) and scale-free (Barabsi and Albert 1999) networks have strongly stimulated research in this area. In the following, we group papers by the topologies being compared.",
               "Small-world versus regular versus random networks A number of authors ( ) have analyzed diffusion in small-world networks with varying degrees of randomness (i.e., interpolations between regular and random networks, cf. . compare diffusion in regular, random, and small-world networks and vary network density as well as \"exposure\" thresholds (i.e., minimum proportion of adopters in the neighborhood) and \"over-exposure\" thresholds (i.e., maximum proportion of adopters in the neighborhood). The latter thresholds inhibit adoption if the proportion of adopters in the social neighborhood is already too large for it to still be \"fashionable\". Results indicate that in a sparse network cascades occur even when consumers' exposure threshold is high. As the network density increases, cascades become more unlikely and the critical exposure threshold becomes smaller. The authors find that the critical exposure thresholds are similar for small-world and regular networks. On the random network, no cascades occur if the density is sufficiently low, because the network becomes disconnected.",
               "Delre et al. (2007b) also compare various interpolations between regular and random networks, but base their model on different assumptions. They do not consider \"overexposure\" and model agents' decision making by means of a threshold function that consists of an individual utility part (obtained if the quality of the innovation exceeds a threshold) and a social utility part (obtained if the fraction of adopters in the agent's social neighborhood exceeds a threshold). Results indicate that innovations diffuse faster in more regular (i.e., clustered) networks than in random networks because individuals are exposed to more social influence and may therefore decide to adopt sooner. As a unique contribution among all reviewed papers, the authors also investigate how the dimension of personal networks (i.e., 1 = only direct first acquaintances, 2 = direct first acquaintances and their acquaintances etc.) affects the diffusion and conclude that bigger personal networks are associated with slower diffusion, particularly in random networks.",
               "A different modeling approach is taken by , who focus on the diffusion of telecommunications technology, an industry characterized by strong positive network externalities. They develop an opinion dynamics model in which adoption decisions depend on a cost minimization procedure that is based on the number of agents in the personal network that decide to adopt or reject a technology. The proposed model constructs a small-world type network starting from a square lattice topology with periodic boundary conditions and randomly rewiring edges. The authors vary the share of rewired edges and find that in the presence of network externalities, rewired edges (i.e., increasing randomness) can facilitate but can also hinder diffusion, depending on how advantageous the advanced technologies are in comparison with the lower level ones.",
               "In many of the reviewed models, agents' decision to adopt is considered a signal in favor of an innovation by neighboring agents. An interesting approach is to also interpret neighbors' refusal to adopt as evidence against the product. formulate a model that incorporates this idea by means of a Bayesian system. To examine the impact of small-world effects, they conduct experiments with a regular square lattice topology and varying degrees of random rewiring. Results show that more rewiring (i.e., a higher degree of randomness) is associated with faster diffusion and an increased final proportion of adopters, which contradicts results by . This can be explained by the differing modeling assumptions. Whereas model only positive feedback effects due to externalities, also implicitly model a \"diffusion of rejection\", which may spread faster in more clustered networks. The authors also study the influence of the location of early adopters, comparing instances of clustered versus randomly scattered \"seed\" adopters (1% of the population) and find that the process of innovation diffusion from an initial cluster is much slower than in the case of randomly spread adopters.",
               "Motivated by the question why diffusion sometimes propagates throughout the whole population and why at other times it halts in its interim process, study the diffusion of network products in random and small-world networks. They specify the consumers' willingness to adopt as a function of the product's intrinsic value perceived by each consumer (normally distributed constant) and the benefit due to local network effects based on the proportion of adopters in the agent's neighborhood. In line with results of , they find that network structure plays a moderator role for the link between network effects (i.e., positive externalities of adoption) and innovation diffusion. Results also suggest that a new product is less likely to reach full diffusion in random networks than in cliquish networks because randomness in the topology makes it harder for an innovation to build up network benefits at the initial stage. However, once the diffusion process reaches a critical mass, diffusion is faster in a random network.",
               "Scale-free versus random Scale-free network topologies (Barabsi and Albert 1999) have also attracted considerable interest, although somewhat less than small-world networks, which appear to be more appropriate interaction models for many (but not all) markets. A paper that focuses exclusively on comparing the diffusion in scale-free and random networks was put forth by . In their model, consumers adopt with a probability that is determined by the fraction of adopters in the neighborhood and two fitting parameters that control time to adoption start and S-curve steepness, respectively. System behavior and the resulting shape of the diffusion curve are a direct consequence of the choice of these two aggregate-level parameters. Based on (only) a single replication per condition analyzed in the paper, the authors observe faster adoption for a random network compared to a scale-free network with the same number of nodes. However, time to full adoption in the random network tends to grow with the number of links. Results also indicate that innovation spreads remarkably faster through what the authors refer to as a \"clustered random network\" (a network in which agents are distributed among three clusters that are then connected sequentially) than through one uniform cluster with the same total population and the same number of initial adopters.",
               "Small-world versus scale-free versus random Few authors have compared all three of the most common network topologies so far. The first paper to compare the effect of small-world and scale-free networks on market dynamics was put forth by Janssen and Jager (2003). They model agents' behavior from a social psychology perspective and adopt the \"consumat\" approach , which incorporates alternative assumptions on behavioral rules. The proposed model simulates market dynamics that emerge from agents' choice between multiple products which are replaced as soon as they become unprofitable. It is not a dedicated diffusion model, but results relate to innovation diffusion nonetheless. Findings indicate that a scale-free network leads to a market dominated by far fewer products as opposed to a small-world network. Results also show that in scale-free networks, a small proportion of consumers (hubs, or early adopters) may have an exceptional influence on the consumptive behavior of others. , while primarily concerned with comparing stochastic agent-based and deterministic differential equation models, also study the impact of different network structures. In particular, they compare fully connected, random, small-world, scale-free and lattice networks. In line with previous research, they find that higher clustering slows diffusion to other regions, because it increases the overlap in contacts among neighbors. In the small-world and regular lattice networks, this leads, on average, to lower peak prevalence and higher peak times. Because the model is concerned with the spread of contagious diseases, one should be cautious when interpreting results from an innovation diffusion perspective.",
               "One of the most comprehensive studies on the impact of social network topology to date was conducted by , who compare diffusion in cellular (Moore neighborhood), random, small-world, and scale-free networks. Furthermore, they also study how the strength of communication links between two market segments-an innovator segment and a follower segment-affects diffusion. They formulate a model with probabilistic adoption ( p = 0.5) when a threshold (proportion of adopting neighbors) is reached. By varying this adoption threshold, the authors find that it affects the likelihood of diffusion cascades differently among the various network structures: diffusion appears more likely in clustered networks under high adoption thresholds. The random network exhibits more consistent peak adoption across threshold levels. Moreover, the effect of network structure becomes more significant when agents' adoption threshold increases. For the two-segment model with varying link strength between innovator and follower market segments, results unsurprisingly indicate that an early emphasis on innovator adoptions rather than innovator-to-follower communications can speed market adoption when follower communications are weak. The authors conclude that network topologies are a key factor in determining an innovation diffusion process and its pattern and that in particular highly clustered networks can have substantially different diffusion patterns than more randomly connected networks.",
               "Other network topologies In an early contribution, first suggest that a focus on social networks could enrich theories that explain the timing and extent of innovations' diffusions. Their social network model is based on a densely-linked core stratum and a weakly-linked peripheral stratum. Depending on initial adopters' location, they distinguish between \"trickle-down\" diffusion processes, which emanate from core strata, and \"trickle-up\" processes that originate from the peripheral strata. The former tend to diffuse innovations congruent with network norms while the latter tend to diffuse contra-normative or competence-destroying innovations. Agents adopt if their individual assessment and a \"bandwagon pressure\" exceeds an agent-specific threshold. The authors use small-sized networks with only 21 nodes and vary density and structure of links in and between core and peripheral strata. Simulating both trickle-down and trickle-up diffusion processes, they find that small, seemingly insignificant idiosyncracies of network structures can have large effects on the extent of an innovation's diffusion. These results have important implications that are not fully elaborated upon in the paper. In particular, the findings suggest that it may be more appropriate to tackle questions in diffusion research with modern complexity theory rather than with deterministic differential equations.",
               "In order to model the effect of social hubs in the diffusion process, Delre et al. (2010) test the impact of the number of contacts as well as degree and direction to which social influences determine individual's choice to adopt. Like in previous work ,b), agents' decision making is based on heterogeneous utility thresholds defined as the sum of social and individual utility parts. However, unlike in prior contributions, the authors use \"broad-scale\" networks ( , i.e., scale-free networks with a cut-off parameter (faster decay of the number of links) to structure interactions and motivate this with constraints people often have in building links with other people. Furthermore, their approach differs from prior work in that connections can be directed and weighted. In particular, they assume that the influence of a neighbor is proportional to the number of links it has and that the probability of directing the link from i to j depends on the number of links that i and j have. Results demonstrate that social influences can have a positive effect on the diffusion of the innovation if a given critical mass is reached, but also can have a negative effect otherwise. Social influence may decrease the chances for the diffusion to spread significantly if the innovation is of lower quality (i.e., induces less individual utility) and thus hardly reaches the critical mass. Uncertainty about the innovation success therefore increases in more socially susceptible markets. These results dissent with the common intuition that fashionable markets are easy to penetrate because consumers tend to copy each other. When the weights are stronger for those neighbors that have more relationships, the innovation reaches higher degrees of penetration. However, this effect is relatively small compared to other network factors. The direction of the relationships among consumers does not substantially affect the final market penetration. Finally, results indicate that innovations have, on average, fewer chances to spread in markets with high social influence.",
               "Strong versus weak ties Granovetter's \"strength of weak ties\" theory ) has also attracted interest in the innovation diffusion literature. It postulates that individuals are often influenced by others with whom they have only tenuous or even random relationships. Although these ties are weaker in absolute impact than more stable, frequent, and intimate \"strong ties\", they may unlock and expose interpersonal networks of external influences in distant networks, thus paving the path for the spread of information throughout society ( .",
               "Adopting this theory, break down the personal communication between closer and stronger communications that are within an individual's own personal group (strong ties) and weaker and less personal communications that an individual has with a wide set of other acquaintances and colleagues (weak ties). They formulate a cellular automata model that does not explicitly represent agents' adoption decision processes, but rather models the spread of information about an innovation by means of probabilistic state changes of passive cells. The probability of an individual cell becoming informed is based on probabilities of becoming informed via weak-tie WoM, strong-tie WoM and exposure to marketing efforts. In their full factorial experimental design the authors systematically vary these three probabilities as well as the size of each individual's personal network and the number of weak tie contacts. Results indicate that the influence of weak ties on information dissemination is at least as strong as the influence of strong ties and that the process is dominated by WoM rather than by advertising.",
               "Summarizing results of the reviewed studies, it can be concluded that the topology of the social network involved in consumers' decision making is consistently found to have a large impact on innovation diffusion. Random networks, as opposed to more regular or more clustered ones, tend to favor the spread of information and they are therefore frequently associated with faster diffusion and an increased share of adopters at the end of the diffusion process. However, in markets in which positive externalities of adoption or strong meso-level social influence (e.g., group conformism, herding behavior etc.) exist, diffusion appears to be both more likely and faster in more clustered networks. Social influences can have a positive or negative effect in these markets, depending on whether a given critical mass is reached. These markets are therefore more uncertain concerning the final success of the innovation.",
               "Overall, managers planning the introduction of an innovation are well-advised to bear in mind that people participate in different networks for different markets and to take into account the characteristics of particular networks relevant for the product, since this may be a critical factor at the early market stage and determine whether a new product diffuses or fails. From a theory-building standpoint, the strong impact of network topologies implies that researchers must be careful when selecting a network structure for diffusion research."

The source of these externalities may be global or local, i.e., the utility of the innovation may depend on the proportion of adopters in the entire social system or in the local social neighborhood ( ).",
               "As noted in Sect. 4.2.1, model local network effects in their opinion dynamics model of telecommunications technology. However, they do not use network externalities as an explanatory variable. also model the diffusion of network products, but they focus on the role of network structure and do not study the impact of network externalities in detail. , by contrast, focus specifically on the effect of network externalities and seek to analyze their absolute impact. To this end, they formulate both an agent-based and an aggregate model. In the ABM, consumers consider adoption only if the proportion of adopters in the population exceeds an agent-specific threshold drawn from a truncated normal distribution (this part of the formulation incorporates global network externalities). Once this threshold is exceeded, an agent adopts with a probability determined by two parameters, one of which controls the influence of the fraction of adopters in the agent's (Moore) neighborhood on a two-dimensional lattice (incorporates local network externalities), and the other controls the influence of \"external factors\" such as advertising. The authors perform simulations with varying adoption threshold distributions and influence parameters and demonstrate that network externalities consistently have a \"chilling\" effect on the profitability of new products. They substantiate this claim by formulating an aggregate model to which they fit empirical diffusion data on six network products and, thus, are able to confirm the \"chilling\" effect of externalities.",

Rust (2010) further challenges the conclusions and argues that the construction of the model makes the substantive implications a foregone conclusion. In a rejoinder, respond to the criticism by defending the global threshold assumption. While no final conclusions can be drawn, it appears that a consensus has emerged from the discussion that future research on network externalities can benefit significantly from the flexibility provided by ABMs."

To investigate the interplay between positive and negative WoM induced by opinion and resistance leaders, respectively, extend a previous model ) that focused exclusively on the role of strong and weak ties. In the extended model, consumers are in one of three states: uninformed (not spreading WoM), adopter (spreading positive WoM), or resistor (spreading negative WoM). The population is exogeneously divided into three groups: (1) opinion leaders, who may only adopt the innovation, (2) resistance leaders, who may only reject the innovation, and (3) regular consumers subject to both positive and negative WoM. Adoption occurs, at a certain probability, as a result of positive WoM or advertising, while rejection occurs as a result of negative WoM. The social network is not modeled explicitly. Instead, global interconnectedness is assumed. The authors vary the proportion of opinion and resistance leaders in the market as well as the probabilities of being influenced by advertising and positive/negative WoM imparted by ordinary consumers, opinion leaders, and resistance leaders, respectively. As can be expected, results indicate that resistance leaders will reduce sales significantly, as a function of both their relative number and the strength of their social influence.",

Moreover, they link diffusion directly to the net present value of the firm. Again, adoption is not modeled as a deliberate decision process, but rather as a probabilistic transition between three states (adopt/reject/none), based on probabilities of being influenced by positive WoM, advertising, and/or negative WoM. The network used in the simulations is a dynamic small-world-type network that consists of both permanent strong ties and randomly changing weak ties. To create the experimental conditions, the authors vary size of strong ties and weak ties, percentage of disappointed consumers, and probability of being influenced by advertising and positive/negative WoM via strong/weak ties, respectively. Results indicate that the presence of weak ties, which is beneficial to the firm under normal circumstances, might adversely affect it in the presence of dissatisfied consumers. Even a small percentage of dissatisfied consumers can cause considerable damage to long-term profits, since they create an invisible diffusion of product rejection which may not be noticed immediately. develop a model that simulates the formation of positive and negative opinions about an innovation and their spread via positive and negative WoM. In particular, they investigate the role of a minority of \"extremists\" with very definite opinions. The proposed model evolved from previous work in an agricultural context and differs significantly from the cellular automata based threshold-models outlined above. Rather than modeling passive automatons with a binary adoption state and stochastic state transitions, Deffuant et al. model agents' adoption behavior with a state transition scheme based on interest (no, maybe, yes) and information states (not-concerned, information request, no adoption, pre-adoption, adoption). Interest is based on social opinion, individual benefit and uncertainty intervals around these continuous values. Individual benefit estimates are probabilistically influenced by social opinion. Social opinion is spread via discussions, which are modeled as message exchanges about the social value and the information state. Discussions are triggered by messages from the media that reach individuals at random, with a given frequency. Both initial social value and initial individual benefit are drawn from a normal distribution. Using a small-world type network, the authors experiment with varying initial distributions of social opinion and individual benefit as well as varying average size of the individual's social network and the frequency of mass media messages. Results suggest that innovations with high social value and low individual benefit have a greater chance of succeeding than innovations with low social value and high individual benefit. Extremists with very definite opinions can polarize the social value and strongly affect adoption when the density of the social network and the frequency of discussion are high.",

This may not be relevant if the speed of diffusion is faster than changes in the social network structure and the structure of the social network is not influenced by the innovation itself, but it may be highly relevant for certain types of innovations. In a policy-oriented study, Dero?an (2002) therefore model the social network as a set of relationships generated by the agents themselves. The authors thereby endogenize the evolution of the social network as a step-by-step process based on the assumption that two individuals are more confident in each other if they share a common opinion (i.e., homophily). The simulation captures the emergence of a collective evaluation of an innovation and explains diffusion failure as the formation of a negative collective evaluation. Unlike most other models reviewed, Dero?an uses a directed influence graph that incorporates both positive and negative (inhibitive) influence. Drawing on ideas from the opinion dynamics literature, the authors model adoption decisions based on individual opinions (i.e., continuous propensities to adopt). The formation of these opinions, as a cumulative process, gradually increases the pressure of the whole community on individual opinions. The authors examine the impact of receptivity and network size on opinion and diffusion dynamics. Results confirm that the diffusion of an innovation can be affected by the state of the influence network in the demand side and that irreversible dynamics occur in the system."

Results clearly indicate that beyond a relatively early stage of the diffusion process, the effect of external marketing efforts (e.g., advertising) quickly diminishes and strong and weak ties become the main forces propelling adoption. These results support argument that advertising may be effective in the initial stages of information dissemination, but its importance diminishes after product takeoff and WoM becomes the main mechanism that drives adoption.",
               "Considering both positive WoM from opinion leaders and negative WoM from resistance leaders, also investigate the effectiveness of advertising (cf. Sect. 4.2.3 for a brief model description). They find that in markets in which both opinion and resistance leaders play a role, advertising has a small and nonlinear effect on market size. According to their results, advertising may decrease market size at high levels, since it activates the market's resistance leaders, who (like opinion leaders) are assumed to be highly attentive to advertising and well connected. Based on this finding, the authors also show that activation of opinion leaders in advance of unfocused advertising messages may mitigate the destructive effect of resistance leaders and increase market size significantly. investigate whether firms can learn about the network structure and consumer characteristics when only limited information is available, and use this information to evolve a successful directed-advertising strategy. The authors focus on fashionable products and model both \"exposure\" and \"over-exposure\" thresholds (cf. Sect. 4.1.1). Firms are boundedly rational and not fully aware of the structure of the communication channels among consumers. A genetic algorithm is used to identify efficient strategies to target individual consumers and model the strategy search and learning behavior of the firm. Scenarios with varying assumptions about whether consumers may decide to use the product again after discontinuing its use are tested. As expected, results exhibit either oscillating behavior or a permanent negative effect that causes the diffusion to \"die off\". The authors compare diffusion results obtained with a dynamic advertising strategy (adapted after each period) to random advertising results and demonstrate that the evolved directed-advertising strategies outperform random advertising.",

In line with , the authors find that too much advertising might indeed negatively affect profitability because although it increases the number of adopters, it indirectly also increases the number of disappointed customers and thus triggers an earlier start of the negative WoM process. investigate how promotional strategies affect the diffusion of new products in terms of final market penetration and time to takeoff. They specify \"external marketing effort\" as a probability for any non-adopter agent to be convinced to adopt each period and compare multiple timing strategies and two targeting strategies: targeting many small groups in distant places (\"throwing gravel\") and targeting a small number of large groups (\"throwing rocks\"). These strategies are tested in brown goods (i.e., electronics) and white goods markets (i.e., household products). Findings indicate that (i) the absence of promotional support and/or a wrong timing of the promotions may lead to a failure of product diffusion; (ii) the optimal targeting strategy is to address distant, small and cohesive groups of consumers; and (ii) the optimal timing of a promotion differs between durable categories (white goods, such as kitchens and laundry machines, versus brown goods, such as TVs and CD players).",

The formal description of the underlying model is sketchy and the network model used, which randomly allocates seven ties per agent, does not appear to resemble most real-world social network structures very closely. Nevertheless, simulation results demonstrate that diffusion occurs faster when initiated by opinion leaders rather than by random or marginal agents and that targeting opinion leaders may therefore accelerate diffusion.",

They also find that in markets in which such hubs do not exist, diffusion is less likely to occur. For such markets, direct-toconsumer advertising could be an alternative strategy to stimulate the spreading of the new product in different areas of the network.",
               "Finally, van Eck et al. (2011) also study the role of opinion leaders, but take into account not only their central network position, but also the influence of personality traits and knowledge among influential consumers. To this end, they extend the model developed by . Like in the original model, agents' adoption decisions are based on a utility threshold function that includes individual preference and social influence parts. Social pressure, however, is not modeled as a threshold, but rather as a continuum (i.e., if more neighbors adopt the product, normative influence in favor of the product increases). Furthermore, the small-world network used in the original model is replaced with a scale-free network to better account for the central position of opinion leaders. The authors test critical assumptions by means of an online survey on the WoM behavior of children in the context of the diffusion of free Internet games. The empirical data supports the hypotheses that opinion leaders (i) are better at judging product quality, although they do not know more about the product, (ii) are more innovative than followers, (iii) take more central positions in the network, and (iv) are less susceptible to normative influence than followers. The authors parameterize the model accordingly and find significant differences between networks that contain opinion leaders and those that do not. In particular, opinion leaders increase the speed of the spread of information, the adoption process itself, and the maximum adoption percentage. The results indicate that targeting opinion leaders is a valuable marketing strategy not only because of their central position, but also because of their influential power. Overall, we can conclude that advertising can be an important driver for diffusion success, particularly in the initial stages of information dissemination. Advertising strategies directed at highly connected individuals can be effective in accelerating diffusion. In the presence of negative WoM, however, too much advertising might even have an adverse impact on innovation success. To mitigate the destructive effect of negative WoM, firms should aim to activate opinion leaders in advance. While absence of promotional support may lead to failure of product diffusion, optimal timing and targeting of distant, small, and cohesive groups of consumers may accelerate diffusion. Nevertheless, the most important role of advertising is to spread initial awareness. Adoption itself is mostly driven by WoM, in particular after takeoff, rather than directly being influenced by advertising."

The proposed stochastic cellular automata model incorporates interfirm competition for the exclusive discovery of emergent \"marketing awareness\" and estimates a firm's probability of being \"first and alone\" in the market. The spread of awareness of a need is modeled via two mechanisms: spontaneous, discovery-driven transformation with a fixed probability and WoM induced awareness with a probability which is based on the number of (Moore-) neighbors in the \"aware\" state. Firms can sample the market to identify new needs. To create the experimental conditions, the authors vary the probabilities for spontaneous and WoM driven adoption as well as the number of firms. Results show that if traditional exploration is applied, there is a high probability that at least one other competitor will discover the same need before, or concurrently with, the firm in question. Hence, pioneer status cannot be achieved by exclusive dependence on market-based information. These findings suggest that alternative methods to identify emergent needs based on information that is invariant to market awareness are necessary.",

A small-world-type network topology is used in Janssen and Jager , and complemented with experiments with scale-free networks in Janssen and Jager . Results indicate that market dynamics is a self-organized property that emerges from the interaction between agents' decision making process, the product characteristics, and the structure of interactions between agents.

               "To analyze the diffusion of green products, Janssen and Jager (2002) formulate a co-evolutionary model in which both consumers and firms are heterogeneous in their behavioral characteristics. Each firm produces one core product which it changes in an evolutionary process if it does not meet its business target, defined as a minimum average profit rate. Firms are assumed to be either innovators or imitators who copy successful competitors. Consumer agents have two needs: a social need and a personal need. Personal need satisfaction depends on the difference between the characteristics of the consumed product and the preferred \"ideal\" characteristics. It is assumed that social need satisfaction rises linearly with the number of neighbors who consume the same product. The total level of need satisfaction is defined as a weighted sum of personal and social need satisfaction and rescaled by the relative price level. Consumer agents are heterogeneous in their personal preferences regarding product characteristics and weights of personal and social needs. Simulation results suggest that more deliberation, as is usually the case with important consumptive decisions, yields a faster diffusion in a market in which firms do not adapt their products, but a slower and incomplete diffusion in a market in which firms continuously adapt their product designs. model brand level interactions in the diffusion of durable products and define multiple types of agents (innovators, early adopters, late adopters) that differ in their sensitivity to features, price, promotion, and social influence. Individual adoption thresholds are specified as a function of feature, price, promotion and social influence and compared to fixed exogenous adoption thresholds to determinate adoption behavior. The proposed model does not incorporate social networks and only considers global feedback (total proportion of consumer agents that have adopted). Parameters used in the simulation runs are not fully specified in the paper. The authors present simulation results for sample scenarios modeling the digital camera market and conclude that ABM can be applied to improve understanding of the brand and market-level reactions to changes in marketing mix strategy."

In light of scarce aggregate agronomic data in transition and developing countries, the authors motivate the agent-based approach with its ability to make use of rich available microdata (e.g., from experimental stations, farm records, sample surveys, experts' opinions, and direct observations on field trips), to account for technical, financial, and behavioral constraints at the farm level, to capture a rich set of interactions, and to explicitly model space. The model consists of an economic and a hydrologic component bound into a spatial framework; agents represent farms that interact in various ways, including contagion of information, exchange of land and water resources, and return-flows of irrigation water. The authors identify likely diffusion patterns for specific agricultural innovations and also investigate expected consequences in terms of changes in the use of water, farm incomes, and structural effects of the innovation processes. study the diffusion of organic practices through farming populations in Latvia and Estonia and evaluate the effectiveness of policies to promote them. In particular, they model the effect of social influence, introduction of a higher subsidy, and increased support by organic farm advisors. Based on theory of planned behavior, farm agents exchange opinions, update subjective norm estimates, and adopt organic farming practices if intention exceeds an empirically derived threshold. The authors use a survey dataset collected from regions in Latvia and Estonia and model the complete population of organic and conventional farmers in both countries. Results suggest that social influence alone makes little difference and that economic factors (e.g., introduction of a subsidy) are more influential. However, the combined adoption rate from social and economic influences is higher than the sum of the proportion of adopters resulting from just social influence and from just subsidies. The authors derive specific policy recommendations for both countries and conclude that policies are more effective if they are sensitive to the specific contexts."

               "Zhang et al. (2011) investigate factors that can speed the diffusion of hybrid and electric vehicles on the US market. They model the relationship between multiple agents with unique objectives: (i) consumers, who maximize utility and minimize cost, (ii) manufacturers, who maximize profits, and (iii) governmental agencies, that maximize social benefits. Manufacturer agents optimize their products by means of simulated annealing. Consumer agents choose any or none of the available vehicles to buy. All consumer agents are assumed to be affected by WoM and domain-specific knowledge in the same way and they are not embedded in an explicit social network. Consumers' decision making is grounded in empirical choice-based conjoint data, i.e., each consumer agent is initialized with individual preferences (with respect to vehicle design, fuel type, miles per gallon, miles between charge, and price) corresponding to an individual respondent in a panel survey of automobile experts (the authors acknowledge that the sample population is favorably biased toward alternative fuel vehicles). The authors compare the impact of three mechanisms: an alternative fuel vehicle mandate (i.e., technology push), WoM (i.e., market pull), and fuel economy mandates (i.e., regulatory push). Unsurprisingly, mandating manufacturers to produce only hybrid and electric vehicles is found to speed diffusion of these types of vehicles, in particular that of hybrid options. WoM also positively affects diffusion by decreasing the preference for fuel-inefficient vehicles and inducing a higher willingness to pay for alternative fuel vehicles. Perhaps most interestingly, the authors find that fuel economy mandates (i.e., any vehicle that does not achieve at least 27.5 miles per gallon must pay a penalty) lead to an increase in the market share of fuel-inefficient vehicles and therefore increase air pollution. This counterintuitive finding results from consumers willingness to pay the higher prices (due to penalties passed on by the manufacturers) in order to buy SUVs (including hybrid). The authors conclude that both society and individual consumers are negatively impacted by policies that impose fees that can be re-directed toward the retail price of a vehicle. Results also indicate that there is little interest in electric vehicles and that price will have to decrease and miles between charges have to increase significantly for this type of vehicle in order to reach the mainstream market. Methodologically, the study demonstrates how a thorough verification and validation of agent-based diffusion models can be achieved by grounding, calibrating, verifying, and harmonizing the model. simulate the diffusion of a second-generation biomass fuel on the Austrian market. In the proposed model, fuels are characterized by the attributes price, quality, and \"expected environmental friendlyness\". Consumers' adoption decisions are modeled by means of heterogeneous information and utility thresholds; agents adopt once they have obtained sufficient information (from other consumer agents or through promotional activities) and the utility of the biomass fuel exceeds their adoption threshold. Consumers spread information in a \"preferencebased\" network in which links are created based on geographic distance and agents' consumer type. Homophily is assumed, i.e., agents of the same type are more likely to be connected. In their simulation experiments, the authors divide the market into four segments (price-sensitive, quality-seeking, \"eco-consumers\" and \"snob buyers\") and set agents' preference weights accordingly. They conduct experiments to compare the effectiveness of promotional timing (continuous vs. intermittent) and targeting (experts, consumers in different regions) strategies and combine them with one of two dynamic pricing strategies (skimming vs. penetration). Results indicate that directing promotional activities at opinion leaders can accelerate diffusion considerably. Furthermore, results clearly indicate that speed and success of diffusion is dependent on the geographic area targeted (e.g., large vs. small cities).",

They examine the impact of marketing activities and governmental policies on the diffusion of various conventional fuels and fuel blends (produced by means of 13 different production chains). In their model, fuels are characterized by four attributes: driving costs, environment, performance, and reputation. The authors assume lexicographic preferences; in particular, they assume that price is most important and that other attributes only play a role if prices are similar. The authors define eleven consumer types on the basis of sociodemographic data. Experiments with policies such as price reductions (e.g., through tax and import tariff reductions), perceived emission reductions (through a successful large scale sustainable biomass certification scheme), and addition of a \"buzz-factor\" that increases perceived market share reveal that sustained combinations of interventions are required to bring about a transition away from petrol or diesel. Results suggest that adoption of alternative fuels is likely confined to niche markets with a share of 5% or lower.",
               "Motivated by traffic congestion problems in the Netherlands, study the effects of household heterogeneity and their interactions in the adoption of various transportation mode alternatives. Their approach starts out with classic econometric methods (multilevel nested logit model), but combines the static estimation model with agent-based methods to simulate the evolution of choice behavior over time. Assuming that each agent's choice (which represents that of multiple households) is directly influenced by the choices of its neighbors and socioeconomic peers, interactions are modeled in both social and spatial network structures. Simulation results of a multinomial logit formulation of the model indicate that there is a unique emergent equilibrium solution with a mode share of 60% for automobile commuters, approximately 25% for public transit, and approximately 15% for bicycle commuters. Simulation results of a nested logit version, however, are dramatically different with a mode share of approximately 93% for public transit commuters. The paper presents a promising methodological approach for combining agent-based modeling with econometric estimation, which allows researchers to make use of empirical microdata. However, counterintuitive and inconsistent results do not allow to draw any practical conclusions for the application case at hand. Furthermore, because the model does not focus on innovations, the approach cannot be applied directly to cases where consumers are not aware of the full set of available alternatives.",
               "The models discussed so far in this section aim for predictive accuracy. However, due to the inherent problem that innovation diffusion predictions can only be validated ex-post, all of them are, at least to some extent, speculative thought experiments until data for validation becomes available. One of only a few ABMs that demonstrably replicate observed market behavior is put forth by , who model diffusion in a competitive automobile market. In the proposed model, consumers evaluate available cars characterized by multiple cost and benefit attributes based on available product information, their individual preferences, and social influence. An innovative aspect of their approach is the use of multi-attribute fuzzy decision making. The authors simulate the diffusion of six full-sized cars available in the Korean market. To obtain data for model parameterization, they conduct a survey with 400 potential consumers to estimate their individual weights for nine attributes as well as sensitivity to social influence. Calibrating the small world social network parameters with observed diffusion data, the authors find that the simulated results fit actual sales data well. The approach for model calibration and ex-post validation is interesting and initial results appear promising. It would be even more intriguing to examine whether the calibrated model is also capable of producing ex-ante estimates of the diffusion of newly introduced cars, rather than replicating past observed diffusion when calibrated appropriately.",

               "The first, , is concerned with the diffusion of water-saving innovations in Southern Germany. In the proposed model, each agent represents the households of one of five \"lifestyle groups\" on one square kilometer. The definition of these lifestyle groups (\"Sinus-Milieus\") is not specified in the paper. Agents decide upon adoption or rejection of shower-heads, toilet flushes, and a rain-harvesting system. Depending on the innovation category and lifestyle group, one of two decision rules is used to make adoption decisions: (1) a cognitively demanding deliberate decision rule, which is based on multi-attribute utility functions, or (2) a simple rule based on a lexicographic heuristic and imitation. The authors use empirical data from a questionnaire survey and validate the model with historic marketing data on toilet flush adoption. Simulation results suggest that water-saving innovations are likely to diffuse further in Southern Germany and that therefore water demand per capita is bound to further decrease if water-related habitual behavior remains more or less constant. model the adoption of domestic micro co-heating and power (micro-CHP) in the Netherlands, which produces electricity in cogeneration with domestic heating. Assuming falling prices due to learning effects, they examine whether subsidy schemes can effectively accelerate the diffusion of micro-CHP. In the proposed model, agents are perfectly rational and make decisions to buy conventional condensing boilers or adopt micro-CHP based on total upfront and usage cost. The authors account for heterogeneity by modeling five house types with corresponding levels of natural gas needed for domestic heating, but do not model any interactions between agents. The proposed model is therefore a micro-model, but lacks important characteristics of ABMs, which is why no emergent phenomena can be expected in the results. Publicly available empirical data from various sources as well as estimates for gas and electricity use for the five housing types modeled are used in the simulations. Not surprisingly, the authors find that the market diffusion of micro-CHP is affected significantly by fuel prices. In particular, results show that the effect of electricity price considerably offsets the effect of gas price. Based on simulations of various subsidy schemes that affect either cost of purchase or costs for usage, they also conclude that subsidies could considerably accelerate the diffusion of micro-CHP.",
               "Finally, Zhang and Nuttall (2011) introduce a model that simulates the diffusion of smart electricity meters (a technology that offers consumers detailed information about energy consumption) in Great Britain as a function of different policy options. Consumers' decision making is formalized using theory of planned behavior. More precisely, consumer agents' attitude is expressed as a function of electricity prices and individual price sensitivity. Their subjective norm toward choosing an option is influenced by WoM and the agent's individual motivation to comply. Perceived behavioral control is influenced by a range of environmental factors such as smart metering infrastructure or service availability. Combining these factors, a consumer agent's intention to choose an option is formalized as a function of it's attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control toward choosing an option. Electricity supplier agents adjust electricity prices once every three months and disseminate price information to consumer agents. The environment is modeled as a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions. Consumer agents are linked to neighboring agents as well as to random remote agents. The authors note that the resulting interaction structure exhibits both small-world and scale-free characteristics. Four scenarios are evaluated, varying who pays for the smart meters (government, electricity suppliers, or distribution network operators) and how they are rolled out (competitively or monopoly). Adoption is fastest in the government-financed competitive roll-out scenario, followed by government-financed monopoly roll-out and electricity supplier-financed competitive roll-out. After the introduction of smart meters, the simulation shows a dynamically unstable state of consumer switching. As a policy implication, the authors suggest that the U.K. government, in mandating electricity supplier-financed competitive roll-out, is currently persuing the least effective strategy because electricity suppliers tend to avoid using any mass media to disseminate the policy since they have to bear the cost of the meters."

Using an ABM, they show that cross-cultural differences in social influence cause market inequalities and validate these results with survey data from China, the Netherlands, Italy, and Spain. The ABM they develop mimics the behavior of movie visitors and incorporates the social influences they exert on each other before and after visiting movies. This explicit distinction between the effects of coordinated consumption (i.e., social influence derived from intended behavior of others) and imitation (i.e., social influence derived from the past behavior of others) is a unique contribution of their paper. The model can be summarized as follows: Each simulation period, consumer agents become aware of movies with a probability determined by the buzz these movies create, which before release depends on pre-release advertising budget and after release depends on success at the box office. Then, agents are selected according to their heterogeneous probabilities of attending a movie. For each agent, expected utility, which is specified as the sum of individual and social utility parts, is calculated for each movie it is aware of. Individual utility is based on the fit between individual preferences and the movie characteristics; social utility is based on the fraction of agents that have seen the movie (imitation), and the proportion of agents that are informed about the movie but have not seen it yet (coordinated consumption). Hence, social influence is modeled on the macro-level and no social network is used to structure interactions. The main simulation results provide an explanation why a few movies dominate the market and show that social influence is the main driver of market inequalities. Furthermore, results indicate that coordinated consumption has a much stronger effect (almost four times) than imitation. The authors confirm this result empirically by means of a cross-national field study in countries selected based on their level of individualism (vs. collectivism). Results suggests a U-shaped relationship between a country's level of collectivism-individualism and members' susceptibility to social influence. Apart from the explicit distinction between preand post-purchase WoM as an important theoretical contribution, and the generated insights about cultural differences in the motion picture industry, the paper also contributes methodologically by demonstrating how agent-based modeling and empirical surveys can complement each other to create new insights that could not be gained using either method alone.",

As the methodology continues to mature, it can be expected to become increasingly accepted not only as a research tool to guide intuition and facilitate theory building, but also as a decision support tool that provides managerial insights and policy recommendations not easily available with more traditional modeling techniques."

However, there is still a lack of theoretical clarity about \"social influence\", a term that is used prevalently but inconsistently in the literature to denote a number of distinct concepts modeled with a wide range of different mechanisms. Further empirical research is also needed to clarify what micro-, meso-, and macro-level mechanisms of social influence act in different types of markets, market conditions, and stages of the diffusion process.

As this review has shown, models for theory-building are typically based on simple, if not simplistic, conceptions of human decision making. These models do not aim to provide forecasts or facilitate managerial diagnostics and the quantitative results they produce should therefore only be interpreted qualitatively with respect to the modeled effects. More recently, however, this role of ABMs in diffusion research as tools for theoretical inquiry has been complemented by ABMs tailored to particular application domains. The latter models provide managerial guidance and policy analyses, but they are not generic enough to be used in any other than the narrow substantive domains modeled. The gap between these two extremes may be the area in which progress would be most beneficial in terms of providing managers with simple, robust, adaptive and easy to control models that are as complete as possible (cf. and still applicable to a range of applications as wide as possible. So far, none of the reviewed models are designed to be used by and provide decision support to end-users directly, which may be attributed to their still relatively early stage of development. To make progress toward providing such support, both more solid empirical foundations and better, more adaptable and versatile models need to be developed.",
               "To this end, additional aspects and more sophisticated decision rules need to be incorporated into models which, however, also makes them more complex. Theoretic models have so far largely avoided this complexity by intentionally describing agents and decision rules in a highly stylized manner, following the postulation that the complexity should be in the results and not in the assumptions of the model . This approach comes with the risk of missing important aspects of the modeled real-world behavior and, thus, ending up with an inadequate model. The critical challenge for future research therefore lies in striking an appropriate balance between simple models (Keep It Simple Stupid-KISS) that may be enriched later on, and descriptive models (Keep It Descriptive Stupid-KIDS) that can be simplified wherever justified .",
               "A recurring issue (cf., e.g., , which we continue to emphasize here, is the difficulty of validating ABMs in general, and agent-based diffusion models in particular. Like conventional differential equation models, agent-based diffusion models can only be validated ex-post. A viable approach is to use historic diffusion data for validation, which, however, is not very helpful for highly specialized forecasting models for a particular innovation as results are largely irrelevant in retrospective. Striking the proper balance between application-specific model detail and generic applicability is therefore important as it may allow modelers to reuse validated models or model components. While ABMs share many of the problems of aggregate models with respect to validation, these problems are exacerbated by the difficulty of simultaneously mapping networks, collecting individual-level data, and tracking diffusion ( ). Furthermore, their typically much larger parameter space and degrees of freedom also makes validation a daunting task. Future research may therefore strive to establish a collection of validated model components, mechanisms, and parameters for specific types of markets and market conditions, which can be assembled as needed to model the diffusion of particular innovations.",
               "Our review has also shown that a number of key aspects have been largely neglected so far, despite their relevance in diffusion processes and ABMs excellent ability to tackle them. First, scant attention has been paid to the spatial dimension of diffusion processes, despite ABMs' rich potential to account for spatial heterogeneity. This is surprising, since innovation diffusion has long been recognized and modeled as a spatial process (cf., e.g., the pioneering empirical work and models developed by . Few attempts have thus far been made to account for space explicitly, some notable exceptions in the applied literature ( notwithstanding. suggest using the spatial dimension of sales data for early prediction of new product success and apply agent-based modeling as a testbed for cross-entropy measurement against observed sales data. Cellular automata models are also based on a pseudospatial regular structure, but it is unclear how this discrete spatial structure relates to actual space, in which consumers are distributed continuously, irregularly, and heterogeneously. In order to recognize the theoretical and practical importance of spatial diffusion and obtain insights into its effect, modelers will have to broaden the scope of ABMs.",
               "Second, it is remarkable that repeat purchase has not been considered in most ABMs so far. While diffusion models are per definition primarily concerned with initial adoption, repeat purchase plays an important role in diffusion processes, e.g. as a social signal. Furthermore, it is a major source of revenue in many goods and services industries ( . ABMs that account for repeat purchase could improve our understanding of how initial adoption and repeat purchases interact and jointly shape diffusion processes. Repeat purchases should also not be neglected for practical reasons, since they determine firms' long-term growth and profitability. Developing ABMs for sales rather than for adoption is therefore a promising area for future research (cf. .",
               "Finally, our review has shown that modelers have so far paid little attention to competition. Most of the reviewed ABMs are based on the assumption that the innovation has its own exclusive market potential, which is not affected by competitors' products and actions. While this may be a reasonable approach in some cases, more often than not, firms face intense competition from incumbent products and/or other innovators when introducing new products. Janssen and Jager ) have therefore developed market dynamics models that capture competition on an abstract level based on detailed psychological models of consumer behavior. model competition between an incumbent and an entrant to study the emergence of disruption. However, their model does not take diffusion processes into account. Future research may build upon these approaches and model consumer behavior in a competitive multi-brand context to realistically capture market dynamics and obtain insights into their effects as well as to provide managers with decision support in a competitive setting. To make progress toward models that account for competition, it is also necessary to identify appropriate mechanisms to explicitly model product characteristics and consumer preferences. Early attempts in this direction have already been made in some of the applied models reviewed. We expect this development to continue as the number of real-world applications increases.",
               "Despite various remaining challenges and limitations, ABMs have already proven to be useful tools for theoretical diffusion research and also demonstrated their potential for practical applications. The field offers excellent opportunities for interdisciplinary research and we hope that this review has provided an overview of the broad range of efforts made by a vibrant and growing research community as well as a glimpse of what may lie ahead."
