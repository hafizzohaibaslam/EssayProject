               "This article describes research into the discovery and modelling of emergent temporal phenomena in social networks. It summarizes experimental results that bring together two views in contemporary science: Bayesian analysis and link prediction, to enhance the current understanding of emergent temporal patterns in social network analysis (SNA), particularly in value creation through social con-nectedness-an important, and growing, discipline within management science. Traditional link prediction methods use the values of metrics in a graph to determine where new links are likely to arise, and little work has been done on analyzing long-term graph trends. We have found that existing graph generation models are unrealistic in their prediction, and can be complemented through the use of temporal metrics, in the study of some networks. To date, no temporal information has been used in link prediction research, thereby excluding valuable temporal trends that emerge in sociogram sequences and also lowering the accuracy of the link prediction. We extracted information from the Pussokram online dating network dataset, and 9,939 cases of each class were formed. Logistic regression in the Weka data mining system was used to perform link prediction. Our results show that temporal metrics are an extremely valuable new contribution to link prediction, and should be used in future applications. In addition to using metrics to measure the local behaviors of participants in social networks, we used Bayesian networks to model the interrelationships between the metrics as local behaviors and links forming between individuals as emergent behaviors (social complexity). We also explored how the metrics evolve over time using Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN)."

Social networks are complex systems that are characterized by high numbers of dynamically interconnected component entities, and a high degree of timebased evolutionary interactions between these entities. Temporal changes in social networks are difficult to understand and anticipate, because of the structures of constraint and opportunity negotiated and reinforced between interacting individuals.

Such changes, for modern organizations, can come in the form of globalization, deregulation, competition, technology and political transformation. The agents in such a constantly changing system tend to step out of the traditional boundaries of their network (within-group identification), act and react to, and evolve in relation to, the actions of other agents and events in the environment to achieve a more desirable end, e.g., to learn faster in the changing environment, or to collaborate better, or to craft more relevant identities, or to seek help in making major decisions, or to negotiate and renegotiate relationships of power, etc.",

After the specified period, usually the organizational strategy is reviewed, altered, or rewritten or totally revoked in favour of a new strategy, and its agents then enact new behaviors against such a plan. We contend, however, that organizations are not static, atomistic agents, instead they are recurring in dynamic agent linkages and embedded in networks of increasing importance ) that progressively influence competitive actions and may themselves challenge the interpretive schema and supportive structures, and ultimately even delegitimize the existing archetype."

               "S ocial Network Analysis (SNA) is a research area aimed at understanding social complexity by representing and analyzing social networks using mathematical graphs. This was first done by researchers, such as in the USA, who interpreted Kurt Lewin's social interaction theory into graph theory-thereby helping to transform the study of social networks from description to analysis. In this theory, a graph G is a structure consisting of a set of nodes V (also called vertices), and a set of links E (also called arcs or edges). In our discussion the terms graph, network, social network and sociogram are used interchangeably. A graph can be bi-directed 1 , meaning that we are not concerned about the order of the nodes in a link. Alternatively, a graph is directed, meaning that the nodes in a link form an ordered pair. Nodes represent people and links represent some type of relationship between people. For the purposes of this discussion a link exists between two people if they have exchanged a message in the past. Thus links are never removed once they have been formed. There appears to be one standard textbook on SNA ( , cited by the large majority of researchers in this field. Although SNA has existed for over fifty years, most analysis techniques have been designed for static data, or at least a static archetype of social organization. For example, contains no mention of temporal metrics, even though it was written in 1994 when electronic networks were well established. With the increase in the use of computers, collecting enough data to create numerous graphs over fixed time intervals becomes possible. An example is creating a graph per week from email data, using a server's email log of 'to . This series of graphs can be used to study the evolution of the network and the change over time in various metrics. Predicting certain changes to a social network is called the link prediction problem. "

A DBN provides a compact representation of temporal probabilistic processes such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM). It contains slices of sub-models which facilitate its probabilistic reasoning over time. That is, we can interpret the present, understand the past and predict the future.

The observable nodes are 'Forming', 'DegreeT', 'DegreeF', 'Katz', 'PA', 'CN' and 'AA' which serve as the evidence variables 'E', to the unobservable variable called 'HiddenNode'. We tested this DBN using the 150 time slices of the dataset used in the temporal analysis, using the metrics defined in the previous sections. The primary objective of this DBN is to predict relationships between metrics (local behaviors) and links forming (global behaviors) in future time steps. Using this, possible links can be predicted between two or more people using the predicted relationships from observed nodes. 30% dataset, but it was used by the genetic algorithm.

However, such decomposability of every HGA component is to level complexity into simplicity. More information can be found in .",

It is our contention that the fluidity and temporality of the interrelationships, making up such networks, render it dependent on changing contexts-and therefore accurate prediction, going forward, becomes difficult (near impossible) using traditionally static methodologies.",

These path-based and neighbor-based measures outperformed simpler metrics, and so we used these in our experiments. We were able to show that when emergent temporal trends are ignored in sociogram sequences, the link prediction accuracy is significantly lower than when included."
