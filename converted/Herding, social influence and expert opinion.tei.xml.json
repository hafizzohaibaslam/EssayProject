               "The aim of any expertistoform judgments rationally, ideally coinciding with an objective truth. In reality, expert opinions are only partially based on an individual's objective assessment of the data because opinions are often formed under conditions of fundamental uncertainty: data are scarce, the future is unpredictable and so subjectivityi nevitably biases opinion. This is particularly true in economics and finance where endogeneity reflects the causalr ole played by beliefs, e.g. stock prices go up because people believe that they will go up. This paper explores limits on effective formation of expert opinion given fundamental uncertainty. It has applications to formation of experto pinion and expert elicitation in ar ange of areas including academia, oil exploration, finance and scientific research. The focus is on deepening our understandingo fe xperto pinion formation and identifying the factors leading to inefficient outcomes in terms of the accumulation of knowledge and learning. In uncertain situations, peopleemploy heuristics and rules of thumb to guide their interpretation of events and this can create problems of cognitive bias, including group biases occurring whenb eliefst end to coincidew ith the prior opinions of others, creating herding and path dependency. This tendency to follow others may be magnified by others ocial influences including reputation-building and conformity preference. The relative impacts of the positive and negativee xternalities of social influences intensify as opinions spread from experts to amateurs, especially because amateurs seem to be more strongly susceptiblet os ocial influences. There are ar ange of social influences on opinion formation among academics and other experts . Some social influences are valuable-for example, replicating results is av aluablea spect of scientific research and if ah ypothesis has genuinelybeen verified across arange of different studies, then that may be because it is a more plausible and probable hypothesis. The wisdom of collective opinion has been analyzed extensively. But social interactions can also distortt he path of learning and knowledge formation. Academics and other experts may, consciously or unconsciously, follow ag roup consensus. This may reflectagenuine accumulation of knowledge; more people may supportap articulart heory on the basis that, all things beinge qual, there is more evidence from others that it is true. At heory or hypothesis that has widespread supportm ay be, probabilistically, more likelyt ob et rue, and Bayesian models of social learning are based around the insight that the chances of al arge number of people supporting af alse hypothesis are smaller than the chances of al arge number of people supporting atruehypothesis. Also, supporting an existing hypothesismay reflect genuine verification and replication of results, and this is avaluable aspectofintellectual progress, particularly in the experimental sciences. So, supporting consensus views does not necessarily mean that those views are wrong. Problems emerge,however,when following aconsensus opinion reflects othermotivations not connected to the pursuits of knowledge and truth. This may lead to excessive weight beingassigned to apopular theory even in the face of contrary objective evidence.",

There are various versions. The essential insights of REH focus on the complete use of currently available information to form forward-looking expectations of future outcomes. REH developed as ar esponse to the adaptive expectations hypothesis, which implied backward-looking expectations and systematic mistakes;inREH models, expectations are assumed to change randomly and only in response to unexpectednews so expectations follow ar andomw alk process and errors are not repeated. Knowledge is treated as aflow variable implicitly embedding the assumptionthat individual beliefs are flowing into astock of knowledge, which increases without limit.While stronger versions, usually associated with atomistic independent rational agents and perfect information, are inconsistent with social influences on opinion formation, others' opinions can in principle be embedded as part of arational agent's information set givenasymmetric information. A more important limitation of REH in the context of social influences on belief formation is the focus on equilibrium outcomes. REH models assume that rational agents adjust quickly to new information and therefore knowledge formation is not adisequilibrium process.",

These approaches do not address the problem that information is not easily quantifiable.

In learning and belief formation, experts may be affected by ar ange of influences, not only payoffs and others' strategies.
