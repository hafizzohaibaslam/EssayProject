In our approach, the well-known DBLP dataset is used and we try to find some skills that are related to an author that we were not aware of before. To realize our objective, we cluster authors and skills using Spectral Graph Clustering algorithm, then simultaneously obtain author and skill clusters via Bipartite Graph (Bigraph) Spectral Co-clustering approach, and then generate predictions based on the outputs of clustering and co-clustering steps. Accordingly, we utilize clustering and co-clustering advantages to predict the probability of link existing between an author and a skill.

This realm deserve conducting considerable research due to its wide varieties of applications in collaborative filtering, information retrieval and other approaches as link prediction problem. Be noted that, the relationship between authors and skills can be represented as a bigraph, which means a graph who have two disjoint part with some links between their nodes as shown in . Whereas it is possible to represent authors (skills) as nodes of a graph, we used Spectral Graph Clustering algorithm to perform clustering. This method is a powerful technique that has many advantages such as capability of implementing efficiently for large data sets even with a sparse graph. Consequently, the author-skill bigraph is reduced to containing author and skill clusters as its nodes. After clustering step, we perform co-clustering on author cluster-skill cluster bigraph which is faster than authorskill bigraph co-clustering and impart more precision since the partitions are made using pre-formed clusters .",

To solve this problem, various methods were introduced including Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs) , Relational Markov Networks (RMNs) , logistic regression model or other supervised learning algorithms . Approximately, all link prediction methods are defined on unipartite graphs, and applying these approaches on bipartite graphs will not work well.

To form our dataset, we extracted a subset of DBLP containing about 40,000 distinct authors and 12,000 skills. Using information in dataset, the author-author and skillskill graphs and author-skill bigraph are made while these are represented as matrices. To reach our objective, we introduced a co-clustering based approach which includes four steps as, clustering author-author and skill-skill graphs separately, co-clustering the formed clusters and building a prediction model. Using clustering prior to co-clustering, improves our method against some other clustering based methods as we have shown in experimental results section in using RMSE evaluation metric. Another advantage of this proposed method is that it can overcome the sparsity and huge size of datasets efficiently which most of the datasets suffer from these problems. finally, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to search for a probabilistic value that relates an author to a skill in social network field . The main co-clustering property is simultaneously clustering two related sets, so that in each co-cluster, similar items from two sets are placed. Accordingly, We decide to use this property in TEAM FORMATION problem as a future work. There is a task containing some skills and the objective is choosing a number of related authors to perform this task efficiently."
