               "Complex collaborative activities such as treating patients, co-authoring documents and developing software are often characterized by teamwork that is loosely coupled and extends in time. To remain coordinated and avoid conflicts, team members need to identify dependencies between their activities-which though loosely coupled may interact-and share information appropriately. The loose-coupling of tasks increases the difficulty of identifying dependencies , with the result that team members often lack important information or are overwhelmed by irrelevant information. This paper formalizes a new multi-agent systems problem, Information Sharing in Loosely-Coupled Extended-Duration Teamwork (ISLET). It defines a new representation, Mutual Influence Potential Networks (MIP-Nets) and an algorithm , MIP-DOI, that uses this representation to determine the information that is most relevant to each team member. Importantly, because the extended duration of the teamwork precludes team members from developing complete plans in advance, the MIP-Nets approach, unlike prior work on information sharing, does not rely on a priori knowledge of a team's possible plans. Instead, it models collaboration patterns and dependencies among people and their activities based on team-member interactions. Empirical evaluations show that this approach is able to learn collaboration patterns and identify relevant information to share with team members."

               "Distributed teamwork is increasingly prevalent. Technologies such as Google Drive, Dropbox and Github enable teams to share work artifacts and collaborate on complex activities in a distributed, asynchronous manner. The coordination of team activities remains a challenge, however, because these technologies do not have capabilities for focusing people's attention on the actions taken by others that matter most to their own activities.",
               "In a study of complex healthcare teams, we identified five characteristics of complex care that raise significant challenges to effective teamwork and care coordination, denoted \"FLECS\": (1) Flat team structure, (2) Loose-coupling of activities, (3) Extended duration of the teamwork, (4) Continued revision of plans, and (5) Syncopated time scales of team members . In a study of home healthcare teams, Pinelle and Gutwin also found coordination to be especially challenging in teamwork that was loosely-coupled in nature and that extended over a long time period (months).",
               "By decomposing the group activity into tasks carried out by individual team members, loosely-coupled teamwork reduces the need for negotiation and resolution of conflicts . While such decomposition allows collaborators to focus on their individual tasks, it makes identifying dependencies and conflicts harder . The extended-duration of the teamwork further exacerbates the problem, as plans and dependencies between tasks may change. As a result, team members often either lack information about relevant activities of others or are overwhelmed by the amount of information available and unable to identify the subset of information that is important to them . Coordination failures caused by lack of information about others' activities have been shown to result in unmet health needs and potentially preventable health care crises .",
               "This paper formally defines a new multi-agent systems problem, Information Sharing in Loosely-coupled Extendedduration Teamwork (ISLET), situates it in prior information sharing research and presents new methods for addressing it. To support team coordination, solutions to the ISLET problem need to identify and share with team members information that is relevant to their activities under a limited communication budget so as to not overwhelm them with too much information. While our formulation of the ISLET problem was primarily based on our study of complex care teams, looselycoupled extended-duration teamwork also arises in such other settings as collaborative writing of documents and open source software projects , and teams in these settings face similar information sharing and coordination problems.",
               "Existing methods for reasoning about information sharing rely on a complete plan knowledge assumption; they assume availability of a complete domain model of the actions or plan library, state space, and utilities or goals. They use this model and knowledge of a team's plans or policies to compute the value of information. Although some approaches assume only incomplete knowledge of agents' plans and use reinforcement learning or plan recognition to infer other agents' plans or parts of the environment model (e.g., transition and reward functions), these approaches still assume a known planning domain (i.e., known state space and actions in MDP frameworks, or known plan library in plan recognition approaches). In many distributed human teamwork settings, such plan models are rarely explicitly specified. For example, the complex health care teams we studied might agree on high-level treatment goals but never fully specify a long-term plan . The approach we present for ISLET problems does not rely on the complete plan knowledge assumption.",
               "Furthermore, existing approaches typically address settings with relatively short-term execution time-frames and tightcoupling of activities. Loosely-coupled teamwork that extends over longer time periods presents both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge: extended-duration teamwork requires continuous revisions to achieve goals. For example, the final structure of a document often emerges only after several iterations by authors, and treatments for patients with chronic conditions evolve over time. The opportunity: while team members' activities may change over time, their overarching responsibilities and collaboration patterns typically persist. For example, while a neurologist might change prescribed treatments, she will likely continue to address the same types of medical problems, and to have similar dependencies with other providers' treatments.",
               "Our approach utilizes the extended duration of such teamwork to learn collaboration patterns from team members' interactions. We introduce a new representation, \"Mutual Influence Potential Network\" (MIP-Net), to model knowledge about such collaboration patterns. MIP-Nets are updated over time based on the system's observations of team member interactions. MIP-Nets implicitly represent role allocation (i.e., team members' primary responsibilities) and dependencies between different team members' activities. We develop the MIP-DOI algorithm which uses the MIP-Net structure to reason about information sharing decisions.",
               "The paper makes the following contributions: (1) it formally defines ISLET, a novel class of information sharing problems; (2) it presents MIP-Nets, a new representation for modeling collaboration patterns and dependencies between team member activities; (3) it presents MIP-DOI, an algorithm for reasoning with MIP-Nets about information sharing; (4) it evaluates MIP-DOI, showing that it is able to share relevant information with team members.",

The constraint on the cardinality of O share (l), is a communication budget, which restricts the amount of information that can be shared, reflecting the need not to overwhelm partners with too much information. The objects in the set O share should be relevant to the partner. The notion of relevance has been widely discussed in the literature on cognition and communication . Intuitively, information is relevant if it will affect the partner's actions. The specific definition of relevance, however, is domain dependent.",

Second, collaborative activities can vary in many aspects, including the size of the group, frequency of interactions and coupling of tasks. For example, Wikipedia articles are written by a large number of authors with a small percentage of the authors making the majority of contributions, while academic papers are typically written by a much smaller number of authors who act in a more coordinated way (e.g., they might divide responsibilities for different sections). Software projects hosted in GitHub also differ significantly in the nature of the collaboration on projects . Some projects include a small group of collaborators that contribute fairly equally, while others have one or two main contributors and a large number of developers who only In the context of Wikipedia articles, the article authors constitute the group of partners P ; the edits made in a single Wikipedia revision constitute a session (each revision is done by a single author); the paragraphs of an article correspond to the set of objects O.

MIP-DOI-partner also outperformed all other baselines, but considering the proximity to the partner node did not improve accuracy on average compared to MIP-DOI-centrality. This result on Wikipedia data is not surprising for several reasons. First, Wikipedia editing is an extremely decentralized activity: there is typically no clear role allocation on Wikipedia because partners do not coordinate their activities, articles are relatively short and the sections of an article often do not require specialization. As a result, authors typically edit all sections of articles and do not focus on particular sections. Furthermore, most authors only make a single revision.

               "This section reports results of a simulation that used the parameter values shown in brackets in . The relative performance of the different algorithms was consistent across other parameter settings. shows the precision obtained by each of the algorithms with l = 3. Overall, all MIP-DOI configurations significantly outperformed all baselines except of course for the omniscient baseline which has access to the graph structure. As can be seen in the figure, of the MIP-DOI configurations, MIP-DOI-focus achieved the best performance. Over time, its performance becomes close to that of the omniscient algorithm as more information about the task structure is accumulated in the MIP-Net. If algorithms do not have access to o f , MIP-DOI-partner (proximity of objects to partners) still outperforms all other uninformed baselines, demonstrating that MIP-Nets effectively recover information about partners' role allocation (i.e., their cluster assignment). MIP-DOI-centrality, despite not incorporating the proximity of objects to o f or p, still outperforms the other baselines, but achieves relatively low accuracy. (b) shows precision-recall curves for the algorithms. The curves were generated by varying the communication budget l between 1 (the leftmost points in ) and the total number of changed objects considered for sharing. The results are aggregated starting from round 15, a point at which the MIP-Net has accumulated some information about partners' activities. As can be seen in the figure, all configurations of MIP-DOI significantly outperform the uninformed baselines. The gap between the performance of MIP-DOI-focus and the omniscient algorithm is relatively small when using very limited communication budgets (l ? 3), demonstrating that the MIP-Net representation can effectively distinguish between clearly relevant objects (high proximity to o f ) and clearly irrelevant objects (low proximity to o f ). For larger values of l, the MIP-Net representation is less capable of separating relevant and irrelevant objects and the difference between MIP-DOI and the omniscient algorithm is greater.",
               "While MIP-DOI-centrality does not perform well, integrating ? (object centrality) with either 2 (proximity to o f , when o f is known) or with 1 (proximity to the partner, when o f is unknown) leads to improved performance in early rounds, as objects that are more central are likely to have more short paths connecting them with other objects, and thus higher probability of being chosen for O modif y . This can be seen in the first row of . However, once sufficient information about specific objects and partners' roles is accumulated, integrating ? results in lower precision (second row of ).",
               "Team members are likely to have more difficulty identifying relevant information about objects they interact with infrequently. Therefore, we examined the extent to which MIP-DOI is able to retrieve relevant objects that do not belong to partners' primary clusters. When using MIP-DOI-focus with l = 3, 72% of the objects in O share were from outside of the partners' primary clusters. Using MIP-DOI-partner leads to less sharing of information from outside the primary cluster (50%), as the DOI focuses on distance from the partner's node. MIP-DOI-centrality shares the most information from outside the primary cluster (87%), but at the cost of sharing many irrelevant objects.",
               "These analyses were based on a specific configuration of the simulation, but the general trends in performance were robust across different parameter configurations of the simulation. We briefly describe qualitatively the effects of varying the simulation parameters on the performance of MIP-DOI.",
               "Team size: varying the number of partners (|P |) does not substantially affect the performance of MIP-DOI-focus. More objects are changed at each turn, resulting in higher precision when using MIP-DOI-focus. Recall, however, does not increase because there are overall more relevant objects. The performance of MIP-DOI-partner degrades with increased team size, as it takes longer to learn the role allocation.",
               "Cluster size: increasing the number of objects in each cluster (|Cl|) leads to lower precision of all MIP-DOI configurations, as it takes the MIP-Net longer to capture the dependencies (constraints) between objects and the roles of partners.",
               "Number of modified objects: when increasing the number of objects a partner can change in a session (k), there are two effects: on the one hand, more information is incorporated in the MIP Update procedure (as more actions are taken). On the other hand, the relationship between pairs of objects is less indicative of constraints between them (e.g., there is a higher likelihood of choosing more distant objects to change together with o f ). Overall, the performance of MIP-DOI is similar across different values of k. Precision increases as there are simply more relevant objects, but recall does not. Role allocation strictness: the strictness of role allocation is determined by pr primary , that is, the probability that a partner chooses o f from its primary cluster. The performance of MIP-DOI-partner is affected most by the changes to role allocation: with more strict role allocation (higher pr primary ), it is easier to capture the roles of different partners, and thus the proximity between object nodes and the partner node is more indicative of relevance. The other algorithms are not affected much by these changes. Their precision slightly decreases when increasing pr primary as less relevant objects change between each partner's consecutive sessions, but recall remains similar.",
               "Graph structure: the parameters pr within and pr between determine the likelihood of edges (constraints) connecting vertices in the same and in different clusters respectively. Generally, increasing both probabilities means that there are more edges in the graph, and thus more potentially relevant objects to share. Therefore, precision generally goes up with higher values of pr within and pr between , while recall does not. The exact effect depends on the specific values of these probabilities. pr between in essence controls the level of coupling between partners' activities. With smaller values of pr between , it becomes harder for MIP-DOI to learn about the dependencies between different partners' activities, and thus it becomes harder to share with a partner relevant information from outside that partner's primary cluster."

               "This paper formalizes the problem of Information Sharing in Loosely-coupled Extended-duration Teamwork (ISLET), which arises in such distributed human teamwork settings as complex healthcare, collaborative writing, and collaborative software projects. In these settings, complete information about team plans is unavailable as teams rarely explicitly develop detailed plans for their activities. Our approach for identifying relevant information to team members does not rely on the complete plan knowledge assumption as prior approaches do. Instead, it utilizes the extended duration of the teamwork to learn about dependencies between activities and team members' roles. While our motivation for addressing this problem comes from human teamwork, the proposed approach also applies to groups of computer agents or mixed groups of people and computers in which complete plan models are not available. For example, in ad-hoc teamwork settings , agents need to interact with other agents without pre-coordinating, and information sharing algorithms cannot rely on having complete plan models.",
               "The results of our Wikipedia analysis demonstrate that MIPNets capture useful information about collaborative activities based on partners' interactions. The results of our simulations show that MIP-DOI can identify relevant information to share with team members. Two limitations to our approach require mention: First, it needs to accumulate some information about partners' activities before successfully identifying relevant information to share with partners (the \"cold-start\" problem). Second, since it learns collaboration patterns over time, it will not work well in settings in which role allocation and task dependencies change very frequently.",
               "We plan to extend the algorithms in the following ways to address these limitations: (1) initializing a MIP-Net with partial information about the task structure and team members role allocation when such information is available, e.g., using medical ontologies in the healthcare domain, or using the hierarchical structure of a document in collaborative writing settings; (2) incorporating team members' feedback about the relevance of information that has been shared with them into the MIP-Net; (3) incorporating the extent of change to an object (e.g., the extent of change to a paragraph) as an additional component in the DOI computation, and decaying weights on edges over time to \"unlearn\" dependencies that have changed.",
               "As demonstrated by our empirical evaluations, the contribution of the different MIP-DOI components depends on the nature of the collaborative activity. We plan to use optimization methods to set their weights, as well as to allow the users to adjust them with different queries. For instance, a user could request to see information about objects that are \"closer\" to her activities (high beta 1 ), or information about objects that are generally important to the collaborative activity (high ?).",
               "We are currently integrating our algorithm in systems for supporting teamwork: in healthcare, it will be used to proactively notify care providers of information that is likely to affect their care activities in a system we have developed for monitoring care plans of complex patients. For writing, we are developing a Google Docs add-on that will provide an intelligent, personalized \"diff\" to authors."
