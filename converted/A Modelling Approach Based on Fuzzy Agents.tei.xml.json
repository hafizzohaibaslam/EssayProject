               "Modelling of complex systems is mainly based on the decomposition of these systems in autonomous elements, and the identification and definitio9n of possible interactions between these elements. For this, the agent-based approach is a modelling solution often proposed. Complexity can also be due to external events or internal to systems, whose main characteristics are uncertainty, imprecision, or whose perception is subjective (i.e. interpreted). Insofar as fuzzy logic provides a solution for modelling uncertainty, the concept of fuzzy agent can model both the complexity and uncertainty. This paper focuses on introducing the concept of fuzzy agent: a classical architecture of agent is redefined according to a fuzzy perspective. A pedagogical illustration of fuzzy agentification of a smart watering system is then proposed. Software agents are autonomous and distributed entities that are able to develop tasks either by themselves or by collaborating with other agents. An agent is a computer entity, located in an environment that it perceives, in which it acts [2]. This environment can be composed of other agents with whom it interacts independently. Fuzzy logic offers a framework for representing uncertainty and subjectivity of the real world. It has similarities with the way actors act as it uses a model of approximate reasoning that allows it to deal with design uncertainties. Agents, that implement uncertain problems by means of fuzzy logic, are called fuzzy agents [3, 4, 5]. So, how to apply the properties of agents to fuzzy agents?"

               "Complex systems are often characterized by the distribution of their components, as well as the distribution of knowledge to the general activity of these components . When a problem cannot be solved by the concomitant action of several components of a complex system, sensitive to its environment, this leads to a series of interactions, often non-deterministic, between its components. Then the agent paradigm offers an interesting solution for modelling and developing complex systems. In addition, in real situations of decision support or cooperation, knowledge used by the components of complex systems is often inaccurate, incomplete, subject to uncertain assessments. Then, agents can be effectively used to handle complex uncertain problems where global knowledge is distributed and shared by a number of agents of a complex system, aiming to achieve a consensual solution in a collaborative way. Using intelligent agents that implement collaborative and distributed activity of complex system, with fuzzy logic , is recommended due to the uncertain nature of the collaboration, distribution, interaction in cooperative problems solving. So, how to model these agents?",
               "In various fields of engineering (manufacturing, mobile robots, ambient intelligence, etc.), fuzzy agents was proposed as tool to model fuzzy behaviour problems, where agents can decide to act according to a fuzzy-logic rule base . These agents can then use these rules to build a strategy for making decisions . Fuzzy agents are also used in fuzzy reasoning situations, where agents interpret a situation, solve a problem or decide with fuzzy knowledge . Simulation of social relationships is also an area for experimentation fuzzy agents . Implementations of fuzzy agents are also proposed to solve distributed fuzzy problems , or improving the processing of the fuzziness of information, knowledge and interactions, in problem solving processes . Despite the emergence of all this research, agents are not formalized enough to support the holistic view of tasks and processes performed by complex system. Given the need to design agents adapted to model, simulate and solve distributed problems with level of uncertainty, we proposed to better define the concept of fuzzy agents . This paper explains and develops the model of fuzzy agents, their interactions and their organizations.",
